## [6.2.1] - 2025-11-23

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Empty Project Names Breaking Context Injection

**Problem:**
- Observations and summaries created with empty project names
- Context-hook couldn't find recent context (queries `WHERE project = 'claude-mem'`)
- Users saw no observations or summaries in SessionStart since Nov 22

**Root Causes:**

1. **Sessions:** `createSDKSession()` used `INSERT OR IGNORE` for idempotency, but never updated project field when session already existed
2. **In-Memory Cache:** `SessionManager` cached sessions with stale empty project values, even after database was updated

**Fixes:**

- `5d23c60` - fix: Update project name when session already exists in createSDKSession
- `54ef149` - fix: Refresh in-memory session project when updated in database

**Impact:**
- ✅ 364 observations backfilled with correct project names
- ✅ 13 summaries backfilled with correct project names  
- ✅ Context injection now works (shows recent observations and summaries)
- ✅ Future sessions will always have correct project names

## 📦 Full Changelog

**Commits since v6.2.0:**
- `634033b` - chore: Bump version to 6.2.1
- `54ef149` - fix: Refresh in-memory session project when updated in database
- `5d23c60` - fix: Update project name when session already exists in createSDKSession

## [6.2.0] - 2025-11-22

## Major Features

### Unified Search API (#145, #133)
- **Vector-first search architecture**: All text queries now use ChromaDB semantic search
- **Unified /api/search endpoint**: Single endpoint with filter parameters (type, concepts, files)
- **ID-based fetch endpoints**: New GET /api/observation/:id, /api/session/:id, /api/prompt/:id
- **90-day recency filter**: Automatic relevance filtering for search results
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy endpoints still functional, routing through unified infrastructure

### Search Architecture Cleanup
- **Removed FTS5 fallback code**: Eliminated ~300 lines of deprecated full-text search code
- **Removed experimental contextualize endpoint**: Will be reimplemented as LLM-powered skill (see #132)
- **Simplified mem-search skill**: Streamlined to prescriptive 3-step workflow (Search → Review IDs → Fetch by ID)
- **Better error messages**: Clear guidance when ChromaDB/UVX unavailable

## Bug Fixes

### Search Improvements
- Fixed parameter handling in searchUserPrompts method
- Improved dual-path logic for filter-only vs text queries
- Corrected missing debug output in search API

## Documentation

- Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect vector-first architecture

## Viewer UI: Responsive Layout Improvements

The viewer UI now handles narrow screens better with responsive breakpoints:

- Community button relocates to sidebar below 600px width
- Projects dropdown relocates to sidebar below 480px width
- Sidebar constrained to 400px max width

Makes the viewer usable on phones and narrow browser windows.

## [6.0.9] - 2025-11-17

## Queue Depth Indicator Feature

Added a real-time queue depth indicator to the viewer UI that displays the count of active work items (queued + currently processing).

### Features
- Visual badge next to claude-mem logo
- Shows count of pending messages + active SDK generators
- Only displays when queueDepth > 0
- Subtle pulse animation for visual feedback
- Theme-aware styling
- Real-time updates via SSE

### Implementation
- Backend: Added `getTotalActiveWork()` method to SessionManager
- Backend: Updated worker-service to broadcast queueDepth via SSE
- Frontend: Enhanced Header component to display queue bubble
- Frontend: Updated useSSE hook to track queueDepth state
- Frontend: Added CSS styling with pulse animation

### Closes
- #122 - Implement queue depth indicator feature

## [6.0.8] - 2025-11-17

## Critical Fix

This patch release fixes a critical bug where the PM2 worker process would start from the wrong directory (development folder instead of marketplace folder), causing the plugin to malfunction when installed via the marketplace.

### What's Fixed

- **Worker Startup Path Resolution** (`src/shared/worker-utils.ts:61`)  
  Added `cwd: pluginRoot` option to `execSync` when starting PM2
  
  This ensures the worker always starts from the correct marketplace directory (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/`), regardless of where the hook is invoked from.

### Impact

Users will no longer experience issues with the worker starting from the wrong location. The plugin now works correctly when installed via marketplace without manual intervention.

### Verification

Run `pm2 info claude-mem-worker` to verify:
- **exec cwd** should be: `/Users/[username]/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack`
- **script path** should be: `/Users/[username]/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs`

## [6.0.7] - 2025-11-17

## Critical Hotfix: Database Migration Issue (#121)

This is an emergency hotfix addressing a critical database migration bug that prevented claude-mem from loading for some users.

### What was fixed

**Issue**: Users were seeing `SqliteError: no such column: discovery_tokens` when starting Claude Code.

**Root Cause**: The `ensureDiscoveryTokensColumn` migration was using version number 7, which was already taken by another migration (`removeSessionSummariesUniqueConstraint`). This duplicate version number caused migration tracking issues in databases that were upgraded through multiple versions.

**Fix**: 
- Changed migration version from 7 to 11 (next available)
- Added explicit schema_versions check to prevent unnecessary re-runs
- Improved error propagation and documentation

### Upgrade Instructions

**If you're experiencing the error:**

Option 1 - Manual fix (preserves history):
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db "ALTER TABLE observations ADD COLUMN discovery_tokens INTEGER DEFAULT 0; ALTER TABLE session_summaries ADD COLUMN discovery_tokens INTEGER DEFAULT 0;"
```

Option 2 - Delete and recreate (loses history):
```bash
rm ~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db
# Restart Claude Code - database will recreate with correct schema
```

Option 3 - Fresh install:
Just upgrade to v6.0.7 and the migration will work correctly.

### Changes

- **Fixed**: Database migration version conflict (migration 7 → 11) (#121)
- **Improved**: Migration error handling and schema_versions tracking

### Full Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for complete version history.

**Affected Users**: @liadtigloo @notmyself - this release fixes your reported issue. Please try one of the upgrade options above and let me know if the issue persists.

Thanks to everyone who reported this issue with detailed error logs! 🙏

## [6.0.6] - 2025-11-17

## Critical Bugfix Release

### Fixed
- **Database Migration**: Fixed critical bug where `discovery_tokens` migration logic trusted `schema_versions` table without verifying actual column existence (#121)
- Migration now always checks if columns exist before queries, preventing "no such column" errors
- Safe for all users - auto-migrates on next Claude Code session without data loss

### Technical Details
- Removed early return based on `schema_versions` check that could skip actual column verification
- Migration now uses `PRAGMA table_info()` to verify column existence before every query
- Ensures idempotent, safe schema migrations for SQLite databases

### Impact
- Users experiencing "SqliteError: no such column: discovery_tokens" will be automatically fixed
- No manual intervention or database backup required
- Update to v6.0.6 via marketplace or `git pull` and restart Claude Code

**Affected Users**: All users who upgraded to v6.0.5 and experienced the migration error

## [5.5.1] - 2025-11-11

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Enhanced summary hook to capture last user message from Claude Code session transcripts
- Improved activity indicator that tracks both active sessions and queue depth
- Better user feedback during prompt processing
- More accurate processing status broadcasting

**Technical Details**:
- Modified files:
  - src/hooks/summary-hook.ts (added transcript parser for extracting last user message)
  - src/services/worker-service.ts (enhanced processing status broadcasting)
  - src/services/worker/SessionManager.ts (queue depth tracking for activity indicators)
  - src/services/worker-types.ts (added last_user_message field to SDKSession)
  - src/sdk/prompts.ts (updated summary prompt to include last user message context)
  - src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts (pass through last user message to SDK)
- Built outputs updated:
  - plugin/scripts/summary-hook.js
  - plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs

**What Changed**:
The summary hook now reads Claude Code transcript files to extract the last user message before generating session summaries. This provides better context for AI-powered session summarization. The activity indicator now accurately reflects both active sessions and queued work, giving users better feedback about what's happening behind the scenes.

## [5.5.0] - 2025-11-11

**Breaking Changes**: None (minor version)

**Improvements**:
- Merged PR #91: Replace generic "search" skill with enhanced "mem-search" skill
- Improved skill effectiveness from 67% to 100% (Anthropic standards)
- Enhanced scope differentiation to prevent confusion with native conversation memory
- Increased concrete triggers from 44% to 85%
- Added 5+ unique identifiers and explicit exclusion patterns
- Comprehensive documentation reorganization (17 total files)

## [5.4.5] - 2025-11-11

**Patch Release**: Bugfixes and minor improvements

## [5.4.4] - 2025-11-10

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Bugfix**:
- Fixed duplicate observations and summaries appearing in viewer with different IDs and timestamps
- Root cause: `handleSessionInit` spawned an SDK agent but didn't save the promise to `session.generatorPromise`, causing `handleObservations` to spawn a second agent for the same session

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: src/services/worker-service.ts:265
- Change: Now assigns `session.generatorPromise = this.sdkAgent.startSession(...)` to track the promise
- Impact: Single SDK agent per session (previously two), eliminates duplicate database entries and SSE broadcasts
- Pattern: Matches existing implementation in `handleSummarize` (line 332)
- Guard: Leverages existing condition in `handleObservations` (line 301) that checks for existing promise

**User Impact**:
- No more duplicate entries in the viewer UI
- Cleaner, more accurate memory stream visualization
- Reduced redundant processing and database writes

Merged via PR #86

## [5.4.3] - 2025-11-10

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed PM2 race condition between watch mode and PostToolUse hook
- Eliminated `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pm2_env')` errors
- Reduced unnecessary worker restarts (39+ restarts → minimal)

**Technical Details**:
- Removed PM2 restart logic from `ensureWorkerRunning()` in `src/shared/worker-utils.ts`
- PM2 watch mode now exclusively handles worker restarts on file changes
- Function now only checks worker health via HTTP endpoint and provides clear error messaging
- Removed unused imports and helper functions (`execSync`, `getPackageRoot`, `waitForWorkerHealth`)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/shared/worker-utils.ts` (40 deletions, 14 additions)
- All built hooks and worker service (rebuilt from source)

**Impact**: This fix eliminates error spam in hook output while maintaining full functionality. Users will see cleaner output and fewer unnecessary restarts.

**Upgrade Notes**: No action required. PM2 watch mode will automatically restart the worker on plugin updates.

## [5.4.2] - 2025-11-10

**Bugfix Release**: CWD spatial awareness for SDK agent

### What's Fixed

- **CWD Context Propagation**: SDK agent now receives current working directory (CWD) context from tool executions
- **Spatial Awareness**: Prevents false "file not found" reports when working across multiple repositories
- **Observer Guidance**: Agent prompts now include tool_cwd XML elements with spatial awareness instructions

### Technical Details

**Data Flow**:
1. Hook extracts CWD from PostToolUseInput (`hookInput.result.tool_cwd`)
2. Worker service receives CWD in PendingMessage and ObservationData interfaces
3. SessionManager passes CWD to SDKAgent's addObservation method
4. SDK agent includes CWD in tool observation objects sent to Claude API
5. Prompts conditionally render tool_cwd XML with spatial awareness guidance

**Implementation**:
- Optional CWD fields throughout for backward compatibility
- Defaults to empty string when CWD is missing
- CWD treated as read-only display context, not for file operations
- Complete propagation chain from hook → worker → SDK → prompts

**Test Coverage**:
- 8 comprehensive tests validating CWD propagation
- Tests cover hook extraction, worker forwarding, SDK inclusion, and prompt rendering
- All tests pass with tsx TypeScript loader

**Security**:
- Zero vulnerabilities introduced
- CodeQL analysis: No alerts
- Read-only context display (no file operation changes)
- Input validation and sanitization maintained

### Files Changed

**Source Files**:
- `src/hooks/save-hook.ts` - Extract CWD from PostToolUseInput
- `src/services/worker-types.ts` - Add optional CWD fields to interfaces
- `src/services/worker-service.ts` - Forward CWD in message handling
- `src/services/worker/SessionManager.ts` - Pass CWD to SDK agent
- `src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts` - Include CWD in tool observations
- `src/sdk/prompts.ts` - Render tool_cwd XML with spatial guidance

**Built Artifacts**:
- `plugin/scripts/save-hook.js` - Compiled hook with CWD extraction
- `plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs` - Compiled worker with CWD handling

**Tests & Documentation**:
- `tests/cwd-propagation.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (8 tests)
- `context/CWD_CONTEXT_FIX.md` - Technical implementation documentation
- `PR_SUMMARY.md` - Pull request summary and rationale
- `SECURITY_SUMMARY.md` - Security analysis and review
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history entry

### Installation

```bash
# Update to latest version
/plugin update claude-mem
```

Or restart Claude Code to auto-update.

### Upgrade Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
- **No Action Required**: CWD propagation works automatically
- **Existing Sessions**: Will benefit from improved spatial awareness

## [5.4.1] - 2025-11-10

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**New Features**:
- Added REST API endpoints for MCP server status and toggle control
- Implemented UI toggle in viewer sidebar for enabling/disabling MCP search server
- File-based persistence mechanism (.mcp.json ↔ .mcp.json.disabled)
- Independent state management for MCP toggle

**Technical Details**:
- New endpoints:
  - GET /api/mcp/status (returns mcpEnabled boolean)
  - POST /api/mcp/toggle (toggles MCP server state)
- Modified files:
  - src/services/worker-service.ts (added MCP control logic)
  - src/ui/viewer/components/Sidebar.tsx (added MCP toggle UI)
  - plugin/.mcp.json (MCP server configuration)
- Design rationale: Provides runtime control of the MCP search server to allow users to disable it when not needed, reducing resource usage. The file-based toggle mechanism ensures persistence across worker restarts.

**Known Issues**: None

**Upgrade Notes**: No breaking changes. Upgrade by running standard update process.

## [5.4.0] - 2025-11-10

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: MCP Search Tools Removed

**Migration**: None required. Claude automatically uses the search skill when needed.

### 🔍 Major Feature: Skill-Based Search Architecture

**Token Savings**: ~2,250 tokens per session start (90% reduction)

**What Changed:**
- **Before**: 9 MCP tools (~2,500 tokens in tool definitions per session start)
- **After**: 1 search skill (~250 tokens in frontmatter, full instructions loaded on-demand)
- **User Experience**: Identical - just ask naturally about past work

### ✨ Improvements

**Progressive Disclosure Pattern:**
- Skill frontmatter (~250 tokens) loads at session start
- Full instructions (~2,500 tokens) load only when skill is invoked
- HTTP API endpoints replace MCP protocol
- No user action required - migration is transparent

**Natural Language Queries:**
```
"What bugs did we fix last session?"
"How did we implement authentication?"
"What changes were made to worker-service.ts?"
"Show me recent work on this project"
```

### 🆕 Added

**10 New HTTP Search API Endpoints** in worker service:
- `GET /api/search/observations` - Full-text search observations
- `GET /api/search/sessions` - Full-text search session summaries
- `GET /api/search/prompts` - Full-text search user prompts
- `GET /api/search/by-concept` - Find observations by concept tag
- `GET /api/search/by-file` - Find work related to specific files
- `GET /api/search/by-type` - Find observations by type (bugfix, feature, etc.)
- `GET /api/context/recent` - Get recent session context
- `GET /api/context/timeline` - Get timeline around specific point in time
- `GET /api/timeline/by-query` - Search + timeline in one call
- `GET /api/search/help` - API documentation

**Search Skill** (`plugin/skills/search/SKILL.md`):
- Auto-invoked when users ask about past work, decisions, or history
- Comprehensive documentation with usage examples and workflows
- Format guidelines for presenting search results
- 12 operation files with detailed instructions

### 🗑️ Removed

**MCP Search Server** (deprecated):
- Removed `claude-mem-search` from plugin/.mcp.json
- Build script no longer compiles search-server.mjs
- Source file kept for reference: src/servers/search-server.ts
- All 9 MCP tools replaced by equivalent HTTP API endpoints

### 📚 Documentation

**Comprehensive Updates:**
- `README.md`: Updated version badge, What's New, and search section
- `docs/usage/search-tools.mdx`: Complete rewrite for skill-based approach
- `docs/architecture/mcp-search.mdx` → `search-architecture.mdx`: New architecture doc
- `docs/architecture/overview.mdx`: Updated components and search pipeline
- `docs/usage/getting-started.mdx`: Added skill-based search section
- `docs/configuration.mdx`: Updated search configuration
- `docs/introduction.mdx`: Updated key features

### 🔧 Technical Details

**How It Works:**
1. User asks: "What did we do last session?"
2. Claude recognizes intent → invokes search skill
3. Skill loads full instructions from `SKILL.md`
4. Skill uses `curl` to call HTTP API endpoint
5. Results formatted and returned to Claude
6. Claude presents results to user

**Benefits:**
- **Token Efficient**: Only loads what you need, when you need it
- **Natural**: No syntax to learn, just ask questions
- **Progressive**: Start with overview, drill down as needed
- **Flexible**: HTTP API can be called from skills, MCP tools, or other clients

### 🐛 Migration Notes

**For Users:**
- ✅ No action required - migration is transparent
- ✅ Same questions work - natural language queries identical
- ✅ Invisible change - only notice better performance

**For Developers:**
- ⚠️ MCP search server deprecated (source kept for reference)
- ✅ New implementation: Skill files + HTTP endpoints
- ✅ Build/sync workflow unchanged

### 📦 Installation

## [5.3.0] - 2025-11-09

**Breaking Changes**: None (minor version)

**Session Lifecycle Improvements**:
- **Prompt Counter Restoration**: SessionManager now loads prompt counter from database on worker restart, preventing state loss
- **Continuation Prompts**: Lightweight prompts for request #2+ avoid re-initializing SDK agent's mental model
- **Summary Framing**: Changed from "final report" to "progress checkpoint" to clarify mid-session summaries

**Bug Fixes**:
- **#76**: Fixed PM2 "Process 0 not found" error by using idempotent `pm2 start` instead of `pm2 restart`
- **#74, #75**: Fixed troubleshooting skill distribution by moving to `plugin/skills/` directory
- **#73 (Partial)**: Improved context-loading task reporting in summaries

**Technical Details**:
- Modified files:
  - `src/services/worker/SessionManager.ts` (loads prompt_counter from DB)
  - `src/services/worker/SDKAgent.ts` (uses continuation prompts)
  - `src/sdk/prompts.ts` (added buildContinuationPrompt function)
  - `src/shared/worker-utils.ts` (pm2 start instead of restart)

This patch release fixes critical race conditions and state synchronization issues in the viewer UI's project filtering system.

**Fixed Issues:**
- **Race condition with offset reset**: When filter changed, offset wasn't reset synchronously, causing incorrect pagination ranges (e.g., loading items 20-40 for new project with < 20 items)
- **State ref synchronization**: `stateRef.current.hasMore` retained old value when filter changed, preventing new filter from loading if previous filter had no more data
- **Data mixing between projects**: Batched state updates caused data from different projects to appear together in the UI
- **useEffect dependency cycle**: `handleLoadMore` in dependencies caused double renders when filter changed
- **NULL projects in dropdown**: Empty/NULL project values appeared in the project filter dropdown

**Technical Improvements:**
- Combined two separate useEffect hooks into one for guaranteed execution order (reset → load)
- Removed redundant filter change detection logic (DRY principle)
- Simplified validation in `mergeAndDeduplicateByProject` function
- Added `investigated` field to Summary interface for better session tracking

**Files Changed:**
- `src/ui/viewer/App.tsx` - Fixed filter change detection and data reset logic
- `src/ui/viewer/hooks/usePagination.ts` - Improved offset and state ref handling
- `src/ui/viewer/utils/data.ts` - Simplified validation logic
- `src/services/sqlite/SessionStore.ts` - Filter NULL/empty projects from dropdown
- `src/ui/viewer/types.ts` - Added investigated field to Summary interface
- `src/ui/viewer/components/SummaryCard.tsx` - Display investigated field

All changes follow CLAUDE.md coding standards: DRY, YAGNI, and fail-fast error handling.

### Testing

Verified fixes work correctly:
1. ✅ Select project from dropdown → Data loads immediately
2. ✅ Switch between multiple projects → Only selected project's data shown (no mixing)
3. ✅ Rapid switching between projects → No race conditions or stale data
4. ✅ Switch back to "All Projects" → All data appears correctly with SSE updates

## [5.2.0] - 2025-11-07

This release delivers a comprehensive architectural refactor of the worker service, extensive UI enhancements, and significant code cleanup. Merges PR #69.

- **PR**: #69
- **Previous Version**: 5.1.4
- **Semantic Version**: MINOR (backward compatible features & improvements)

## [5.1.4] - 2025-11-07

**Bugfix Release**: PostToolUse Hook Schema Compliance

**Changes**:
- Fixed parameter naming in save-hook to match Claude Code PostToolUse API schema
- Renamed `tool_output` to `tool_response` throughout the codebase
- Updated worker-service to handle `tool_response` field correctly

**Technical Details**:
- Modified files:
  - `src/hooks/save-hook.ts`: Updated interface and parameter destructuring
  - `src/services/worker-service.ts`: Updated observation message handling
  - `plugin/scripts/save-hook.js`: Rebuilt with corrected names
  - `plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs`: Rebuilt with corrected names

**Why This Matters**: The Claude Code PostToolUse hook API provides `tool_response` not `tool_output`. This fix ensures proper schema compliance and prevents potential errors when capturing tool executions.

## [5.1.2] - 2025-11-06

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Features**:

**Breaking Changes**: None (backward compatible MINOR version)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v5.0.3...v5.1.0

## [5.0.3] - 2025-11-05

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Fixes**:
- Fixed Windows installation with smart caching installer (PR #54: scripts/smart-install.js)
- Eliminated redundant npm install executions on every SessionStart (improved from 2-5s to ~10ms)
- Added comprehensive Windows troubleshooting with VS Build Tools guidance
- Fixed dynamic Python version detection in Windows error messages (scripts/smart-install.js:106-115)

**Improvements**:
- Smart install now caches version state in `.install-version` file
- Only runs npm install when needed: first time, version change, or missing dependencies
- Enhanced rsync to respect gitignore rules in sync-marketplace (package.json:38)
- Better PM2 worker startup verification and management
- Cross-platform compatible installer (pure Node.js, no shell dependencies)

**Technical Details**:
- New: scripts/smart-install.js (smart caching installer with PM2 worker management)
- Modified: plugin/hooks/hooks.json:25 (use smart-install.js instead of raw npm install)
- Modified: .gitignore (added .install-version cache file)
- Modified: CLAUDE.md (added Windows requirements and troubleshooting section)
- Modified: package.json:38 (enhanced sync-marketplace with --filter=':- .gitignore' --exclude=.git)
- Root cause: npm install was running on every SessionStart regardless of whether dependencies changed
- Impact: 200x faster SessionStart for cached installations (10ms vs 2-5s)

**For Windows Users**:
This release should completely resolve installation issues. The smart installer will:
1. Show you clear error messages if better-sqlite3 fails to install
2. Guide you to install VS Build Tools if needed (though you probably won't need them)
3. Only run once on first launch, then be instant on subsequent launches

## [5.0.2] - 2025-11-05

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Fixes**:
- Fixed worker startup reliability with async health checks (PR #51: src/shared/worker-utils.ts)
- Added proper error handling to PM2 process spawning (src/shared/worker-utils.ts)
- Worker now verifies health before proceeding with hook operations
- Improved handling of PM2 failures when not yet installed

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: src/shared/worker-utils.ts (added isWorkerHealthy, waitForWorkerHealth functions)
- Modified: src/hooks/*.ts (all hooks now await ensureWorkerRunning)
- Modified: plugin/scripts/*.js (rebuilt hook executables)
- Root cause: ensureWorkerRunning was synchronous and didn't verify worker was actually responsive before proceeding
- Impact: More reliable worker startup with proper health verification

## [5.0.0] - 2025-11-04

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Python dependency for optimal performance**: While the plugin works without Python, installing Python 3.8+ and the Chroma MCP server unlocks semantic search capabilities. Without Python, the system falls back to SQLite FTS5 keyword search.
- **Search behavior changes**: Search queries now prioritize semantic relevance when Chroma is available, then apply temporal ordering. Keyword-only queries may return different results than v4.x.
- **Worker service changes**: Worker now initializes ChromaSync on startup. If Chroma MCP is unavailable, worker continues with FTS5-only mode but logs a warning.

### Added
- **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Combines ChromaDB semantic search with SQLite temporal/metadata filtering
  - Chroma vector database for semantic similarity (top 100 matches)
  - 90-day temporal recency window for relevant results
  - SQLite hydration in chronological order
  - Graceful fallback to FTS5 when Chroma unavailable
- **ChromaSync Service**: Automatic vector database synchronization
  - Syncs observations, session summaries, and user prompts to Chroma
  - Splits large text fields into multiple vectors for better granularity
  - Maintains metadata for filtering (project, type, concepts, files)
  - Background sync process via worker service
- **get_timeline_by_query Tool**: Natural language timeline search with dual modes
  - Auto mode: Automatically uses top search result as timeline anchor
  - Interactive mode: Shows top N results for manual anchor selection
  - Combines semantic search discovery with timeline context retrieval
- **User Prompt Semantic Search**: Raw user prompts now indexed in Chroma for semantic discovery
- **Enhanced MCP Tools**: All 8 existing search tools now support hybrid search
  - search_observations - Now uses semantic + temporal hybrid algorithm
  - search_sessions - Semantic search across session summaries
  - search_user_prompts - Semantic search across raw prompts
  - find_by_concept, find_by_file, find_by_type - Enhanced with semantic capabilities
  - get_recent_context - Unchanged (temporal only)
  - get_context_timeline - Unchanged (anchor-based temporal)

### Changed
- **Search Server**: Expanded from ~500 to ~1,500 lines with hybrid search implementation
- **Worker Service**: Now initializes ChromaSync and handles Chroma MCP lifecycle
- **Search Pipeline**: Now follows semantic-first strategy with temporal ordering
  ```
  Query → Chroma Semantic Search (top 100) → 90-day Filter → SQLite Hydration (temporal order) → Results
  ```
- **Worker Resilience**: Worker no longer crashes when Chroma MCP unavailable; gracefully falls back to FTS5

### Fixed
- **Critical temporal filtering bug**: Fixed deduplication and date range filtering in search results
- **User prompt formatting bug**: Corrected field reference in search result formatting
- **Worker crash prevention**: Worker now handles missing Chroma MCP gracefully instead of crashing

### Technical Details
- New files:
  - src/services/sync/ChromaSync.ts (738 lines) - Vector database sync service
  - experiment/chroma-search-test.ts - Comprehensive hybrid search testing
  - experiment/chroma-sync-experiment.ts - Vector sync validation
  - docs/chroma-search-completion-plan.md - Implementation planning
  - FEATURE_PLAN_HYBRID_SEARCH.md - Feature specification
  - IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md - Testing and validation results
- Modified files:
  - src/servers/search-server.ts (+995 lines) - Hybrid search algorithm implementation
  - src/services/worker-service.ts (+136 lines) - ChromaSync integration
  - src/services/sqlite/SessionStore.ts (+276 lines) - Enhanced timeline queries
  - src/hooks/context-hook.ts - Type legend improvements
- Validation: 1,390 observations synced to 8,279 vector documents
- Performance: Semantic search with 90-day window returns results in <200ms

## [4.3.4] - 2025-11-02

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Fixes**:
- Fixed SessionStart hooks running on session resume (plugin/hooks/hooks.json:4)
- Added matcher configuration to only run SessionStart hooks on startup, clear, or compact events
- Prevents unnecessary hook execution and improves performance on session resume

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: plugin/hooks/hooks.json:4 (added `"matcher": "startup|clear|compact"`)
- Impact: Hooks now skip execution when resuming existing sessions

## [4.3.3] - 2025-10-27

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Made session display count configurable via constant (DISPLAY_SESSION_COUNT = 8) in src/hooks/context-hook.ts:11
- Added first-time setup detection with helpful user messaging in src/hooks/user-message-hook.ts:12-39
- Improved user experience: First install message clarifies why it appears under "Plugin Hook Error"

**Fixes**:
- Cleaned up profanity in code comments (src/hooks/context-hook.ts:3)
- Fixed first-time setup UX by detecting missing node_modules and showing informative message

**Technical Details**:
- Modified: src/hooks/context-hook.ts:11 (configurable DISPLAY_SESSION_COUNT constant)
- Modified: src/hooks/user-message-hook.ts:12-39 (first-time setup detection and messaging)
- Modified: plugin/scripts/context-hook.js (rebuilt)
- Modified: plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js (rebuilt)

## [4.3.2] - 2025-10-27

**Breaking Changes**: None (patch version)

**Improvements**:
- Added user-message-hook for displaying context to users via stderr mechanism
- Enhanced context visibility: Hook fires simultaneously with context injection, sending duplicate message as "error" so Claude Code displays it to users
- Added comprehensive documentation (4 new MDX files covering architecture evolution, context engineering, hooks architecture, and progressive disclosure)
- Improved cross-platform path handling in context-hook

**Technical Details**:
- New files:
  - src/hooks/user-message-hook.ts (stderr-based user-facing context display)
  - plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js (built hook executable)
  - docs/architecture-evolution.mdx (801 lines)
  - docs/context-engineering.mdx (222 lines)
  - docs/hooks-architecture.mdx (784 lines)
  - docs/progressive-disclosure.mdx (655 lines)
- Modified:
  - plugin/hooks/hooks.json (added user-message-hook configuration)
  - src/hooks/context-hook.ts (improved path handling)
  - scripts/build-hooks.js (build support for new hook)
- Design rationale: Error messages don't get added to context, so we intentionally duplicate context output via stderr for user visibility. This is a temporary workaround until Claude Code potentially adds ability to share messages with both user and context simultaneously.

## [4.3.1] - 2025-10-26

## Fixes

- **Fixed SessionStart hook context injection** by silencing npm install output (`plugin/hooks/hooks.json:25`)
- Changed npm loglevel from `--loglevel=error` to `--loglevel=silent` to ensure clean JSON output
- **Consolidated hooks architecture** by removing bin/hooks wrapper layer (`src/hooks/*-hook.ts`)
- Fixed double shebang issues in hook executables (esbuild now adds shebang during build)

## Technical Details

- **Modified**: `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` (npm install verbosity)
- **Removed**: `src/bin/hooks/*` (wrapper layer no longer needed)
- **Consolidated**: Hook logic moved directly into `src/hooks/*-hook.ts` files
- **Root cause**: npm install stderr/stdout was polluting hook JSON output, preventing context injection

## Breaking Changes

None (patch version)
