Trump’s effect on MXN
We provide an empirical analysis of Donald Trump’s effects on the Mexican peso. Our
analysis suggests the exchange rate is perhaps as much as 15% undervalued. In our
view, buying the Mexican peso likely would prove a profitable strategy if Hillary Clinton
wins. However, we remain neutral for now given US election risks are likely to remain
high in the near term.
A model of MXN weekly returns including Trump
We estimate a model of MXN returns with standard financial fundamentals that also
includes Donald Trump’s RealClearPolitics polling average in the US presidential
election. It is generally accepted now that Trump’s chances in the US election have been
a major driver of the Mexican peso (Chart 1).

We estimate a regression of weekly returns on the MXN spot exchange rate on five
variables: a basket of commodity currencies, US equities, the 10-year US bond yield, the
two-year interest rate differential between MXN and USD swaps, and RealClearPolitics
polling average for Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The estimated
equation is
R MXN = b0 + b1*R basket + b2*R SP500 + b3*dy 10 + b4*(r MXN – r USD ) + b5*RCP + e
where R MXN is the MXN spot return, R basket is the commodity currency basket spot return,
R SP500 is the SP500 index return, dy 10 is the 10-year US bond yield change, r MXN – r USD is
the two-year swap rate differential (lagged one period), RCP is RealClearPolitics polling
average for Donald Trump, and e is an error term. The commodity currency basket
consists of BRL, CLP, COP, CAD, NOK and AUD with equal weights. The full data sample
has weekly frequency and runs from 6/20/2012 to 9/21/2016.
The model without Trump yields an R-squared coefficient of 0.50. Including Trump’s
variable increases the coefficient to 0.63, a significant improvement (Chart 2). We use
data only up to 1/27/2016 for parameter estimation of the financial variables. We use
the full sample to estimate the parameter on Trump’s variable due to its shorter history.

A possible 15% negative shock on MXN
According to the model that does not include Trump’s polling average, we estimate that
MXN should be trading at around 16.50, more than 15% stronger than current levels
(spot 19.72). Chart 2 shows the possible magnitude of the Trump effect on the Mexican
peso.
The model including Trump’s polling average appears to do a much better job at
explaining the recent behavior of the Mexican peso. However, it still suggests that the
currency has depreciated more than justified by Trump’s increase in recent polls. Based
on Trump’s increase to 43.9% (RealClearPolitics polling average on 21 September) from
39% (RealClearPolitics polling average on 29 June), our model suggests the Mexican
peso should be trading at around 18.50, still almost 7% stronger than current levels.
This, however, does not necessarily mean that MXN has oversold. The almost 5% gain in
Trump’s polling average since June could have had an outsized effect on MXN if those
gains took place in swing states, potentially leading to crucial Electoral College votes.
Strategy: neutral MXN for now
From a strategy standpoint, we recommend staying neutral the Mexican peso for now.
We believe the Mexican peso would likely strengthen significantly if Hillary Clinton wins
the US election. But there is still significant uncertainty. Net speculative long USD/MXN
positions are somewhat stretched, but could increase much more (Chart 3).
2 Liquid Insight | 22 September 2016
The Bank of Mexico will meet on 29 September, and a 50bp rate hike is already priced in
(Chart 4). A stronger hike, perhaps of 75bp, or a 50bp rate hike accompanied by a
hawkish statement could lead to MXN strengthening in the very short run.

*Owning low delta EURUSD strangles may be an effective and cheap double hedge in the

Options Risk Statement
Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk
Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.
Investor suitability
The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal.
