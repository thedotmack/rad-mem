IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN
AND FOR BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G.
CASSELL,
CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072
Plaintiffs,
vs.
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
/
PLAINTIFFS/COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT EDWARDS AND
CASSELL'S RESPONSE TO DERSHOWITZ'S MOTION TO DETERMINE
CONFIDENTIALITY OF COURT RECORDS
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by and
through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this response to Dershowitz's Motion to
Determine Confidentiality of Court Records. The records at issue are not confidential, and so the
Court should deny Dershowitz's motion in its entirety.
The court records at issue are three court filings by attorneys Edwards and Cassell
in which they recite their client's (Mr. Virginia Giuffre's) allegations that she was sexually
abused by Dershowitz. These records are hardly "confidential" in this defamation case,
where the parties have claims and counterclaims about these sexual abuse
Allegations. Rather, these records are an important part of this case, since they not only
support the conclusion that Dershowitz abused Ms. Giuffre, but also indisputably establish
Edwards and Cassell's strong basis for filing the allegations on her behalf. Moreover,
contrary to assertions made in Dershowitz's motion, these documents have never been
found to be "confidential" by any other court. And Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 2 of 20
these documents, not only in defamatory statements broadcast worldwide, but also in his
pleadings before this Court and in recent depositions. Indeed, Dershowitz said in his
media interviews that he wants "everything to be made public" and implied that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. Accordingly, Dershowitz has failed to carry his heavy
burden to justify sealing these presumptively-public documents.
I. DERSHOWITZ HAS NOT JUSTIFIED SEALING ALLEGED
DEFAMATORY RECORDS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS
DEFAMATION CASE.
In his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the
records at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing
of "confidential" materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that
"[t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as
provided below." Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida
Supreme Court's admonition that a "a strong presumption of openness exists for all court
proceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public
records available for public examination." Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531
So.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, "[t]he
burden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure." Id. To
obtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a "heavy burden." Id.
Remarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More
important, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this
general principle of access — and which specific exception he believes applies to this
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 3 of 20
case. Accordingly, it is impossible for Edwards and Cassell to respond with precision to his
motion.
The exceptions that might arguably be in play in this case permit records to be maintained
as confidential in order to:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
Prevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, impartial, and orderly
administration of justice;
Protect trade secrets;
Protect a compelling governmental interest;
Obtain evidence to determine legal issues in a case;
Avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties;
Avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a
common law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of
proceeding sought to be closed;
Comply with established public policy set forth in the Florida or United
States Constitution or statutes or Florida rules or case law ....
Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9) (codifying the holding in Barron v. Florida Freedom
Newspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113 (Fla. 1988)). The only exception that seems to even arguably
apply here is exception vi, which itself specifically provides that confidentiality is appropriate
only where disclosure is "not generally inherent in the specific type of proceeding sought to be
closed" (emphasis added). Of course, this lawsuit is a defamation action — involving
a defamation claim by Edwards and Cassell and a defamation counterclaim by
Dershowitz. Disclosure, discussion, and debate about the defamatory statements at issue lies at
the heart of the case. Accordingly, disclosure of these materials is "inherent" in the case itself.
The principle that defamatory material in a defamation case cannot be sealed is recognized
in Carnegie v. Tedder, 698 So.2d 1310 (2d DCA 1997). Carnegie involved a claim and
counterclaim between two parties (Carnegie and Tedder), one of whom alleged that disclosure of
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 4 of 20
the materials in the records would be harmful to his professional
reputation. Carnegie recited subsection vi's restriction on release of materials involving a
privacy right, but noted that "statements Tedder alleged were defamatory and damaging were
allegations in Carnegie's counterclaim for which she seeks damages.
These matters were not peripheral to the lawsuit; they were inherent to it." Id. at 1312. Of
course, exactly the same principle applies here: sexual abuse allegations filed by attorneys
Edwards and Cassell for their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit — they
are inherent to it.
To see how "inherent" the sexual abuse allegations are to this lawsuit, the Court need
look no further than Dershowitz's counterclaim in this case. Count I of Dershowitz's
Counterclaim (styled as "False Allegations in the Joinder Motion) contends that Edwards and
Cassell should pay him damages because they "filed a pleading in the Federal Action titled 'Jane
Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action' . . . ." Dershowitz
Counterclaim at 11 14. Dershowitz's Counterclaim then goes on to quote at length from the
Joinder Motion. His counterclaim contains, for example, this paragraph recounting the
allegations:
The Joinder Motion then goes on to allege — without any supporting evidence — as
follows:
One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to
have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's and well-known criminal defense
attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with
Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida
but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz

Page 5 of 20
Islands. In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other
minors, Dershowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other
minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's coconspirators. Dershowitz would
later play a significant role in negotiating the [Non-Prosecution Agreement] on
Epstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that
provided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida
not only to Epstein, but also to "any potential coconspirators of Epstein." Thus,
Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a provision that provided
protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually
abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity wouldhave been
controversial if disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's
defense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret
from all of Epstein's victims and the general public, even though such secrecy
violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act.
Dershowitz Counterclaim at 1115 (quoting Joinder Motion at 4).
Remarkably, having quoted at length from the Joinder Motion in his Counterclaim in this
case, Dershowitz now seeks to have that very same language from the Joinder Motion deemed
"confidential" and sealed. Compare Counterclaim at ¶15 (block quotation above) with Motion to
Determine Confidentiality, Exhibit A at 4 (composite exhibit with proposed "confidential"
document that includes paragraph beginning "[o]ne such powerful individual that Epstein forced
then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's . . . ."). Dershowitz cannot come before this Court and
file a counterclaim seeking damages from Edwards and Cassell for alleged defamatory
statements and then ask to have those very same statements placed under seal as
"confidential." See Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 531 So.2d at 119 ("although
generally protected by one's privacy right, medical reports and history are no longer protected

when the medical condition becomes an integral part of the civil proceeding, particularly when
the condition is asserted as an issue by the party seeking closure" (emphasis added)).
H. JUDGE MARRA'S ORDER IN HIS CASE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT
THE RECORDS BE SEALED IN THIS CASE.
Dershowitz also appears to contend that Judge Marra's order striking some of the
materials from the records at issue somehow requires that these stricken materials be kept
confidential in this case. Dershowitz's argument misunderstands both the scope of Judge
Marra's order and its effect in this case. His argument rests on a truncated — and misleading --
description of the events surrounding Judge Marra's ruling striking certain documents. A more
complete description makes clear that Judge Marra has not determined the documents are
somehow "confidential" even in the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act case — much less in this
separate state defamation action.
Edwards and Cassell filed the federal case pro bono on behalf of two young women who
were sexually abused as underage girls by Dershowitz's close personal friend — Jeffrey
Epstein. In 2008, Edwards and Casell filed a petition to enforce the rights of "Jane Doe No. 1"
and "Jane Doe No. 2" under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging
that the Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was
pursuing with Epstein. Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736
(S.D. Fla.). In the course of that case, on October 11, 2011, the victims filed discovery requests
with the Government, including requests specifically seeking information about Dershowitz,
Prince Andrew, and others. Further efforts from the Government to avoid any discovery
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 7 of 20
followed (see generally Docket Entry or "DE" 225-1 at 4-5), ultimately leading to a further
Court ruling in June 2013 that the Government should produce documents. DE 189. The
Government then produced about 1,500 pages of largely irrelevant materials to the victims (DE
225-1 at 5), while simultaneously submitting 14,825 pages of relevant materials under seal to the
Court. The Government claimed that these pages were "privileged" for various reasons,
attaching an abbreviated privilege log.
While these discovery issues were pending, in the summer of 2014, Edwards and Cassell,
contacted Government counsel to request their agreement to add two additional victims to the
case, including Ms. Virginia Giuffre (who was identified in court pleadings as "Jane Doe No.
3"). Edwards and Cassell sought to have her added to the case via stipulation, which would have
avoided the need to include any detailed facts about her abuse. Weeks went by and the
Government — as it had done on a similar request for a stipulation to add another victim — did not
respond to counsel's request for a stipulation. Finally, on December 10, 2014, despite having
had four months to provide a position, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was
seeking more time, indicating that the Government understood that victims' counsel might need
to file a motion with the court on the matter immediately. DE 291 at 3-5. Rather than file a
motion immediately, victims' counsel waited and continued to press the Government for a
stipulation. See id. at 5. Finally, on December 23, 2014 — more than four months after the initial
request for a stipulated joinder into the case — the Government tersely indicated its objection,
without indicating any reason: "Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this
stage of the litigation." See DE 291 at 5.

Page 8 of 20
Because the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and
Cassell prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the
motion. One week after receiving the Government's objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms.
Giuffre (i.e., Jane Doe No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)
seeking to join the case. DE 279 and DE 280. (Note: DE 280 is the first of the three documents
Dershowitz seeks to have declared "confidential" in this case.) Uncertain as to the basis for the
Government's objection, the motion briefly proffered the circumstances that would qualify
the two women as "victims" eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e)
(defining "crime victim" protected under the Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion
indicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince
Andrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to
prove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 ("If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove
the following .... "). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's
participation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding
Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new
victims was relevant to existing issues).
After the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about
it. Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane
Doe No. 3 "a serial liar" who "has lied through her teeth about many world
leaders." http ://vvww cnn . co m/2015/01/06/us/dershowi tz-sex -all e gati on/. Dershowitz also
repeatedly called Edwards and Cassell "two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers." Id. On

Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Page 9 of 20
January 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene to argue to have the allegations
stricken. DE 282. Dershowitz also argued that Ms. Giuffre had not provided a sworn affidavit
attesting to the truth of her allegations. On January 21, 2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a
response for Ms. Giuffre and Jane Doe No. 4. DE 291. (Note: This is the second of the three
documents Dershowitz seeks to have kept under seal here.) The response enumerated nine
specific reasons why Ms. Giuffre's specific allegations against Dershowitz were relevant to the
case, including the fact that Ms. Giuffre needed to establish that she was a "victim" in the case,
that pending discovery requests concerning Dershowitz-specific documents were pending, and
that Dershowitz's role as a defense attorney in the case was highly relevant to the motive for the
Government and defense counsel to conceal the plea deal from the victims. DE 291 at 17-26 &
n.17. The response included a detailed affidavit from Ms. Giuffre about the sexual abuse she had
suffered from Epstein, Dershowitz, and other powerful persons. DE 291-1. On February 6,
2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a further pleading (and affidavit from Ms. Giuffre, see DE 291-
1) in support of her motion to intervene. (Note: this affidavit is the third of the three documents
Dershowitz seeks to have declared confidential.)
On April 7, 2015, Judge Marra denied Ms. Giuffi-e's motion to join the case. Judge
Marra concluded that "at this juncture in the proceedings" details about the sexual abuse she had
suffered was unnecessary to making a determination "of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4
should be permitted to join [the other victims'] claim that the Government violated their rights
under the CVRA. The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in
sexual activities are impertinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr.
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 10 of 20
Epstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that the details
involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government." DE 324 at 5 (emphasis
in original). While Judge Marra struck those allegations, he emphasized that "Jane Doe 3 is free
to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should [the victims]
demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented
for the Court's consideration. Judge Marra then denied Ms. Giuffre's motion to join the case,
but allowed her to participate as trial witness: "The necessary 'participation' of [Ms. Giuffre] ...
in this case can be satisfied by offering ... properly supported — and relevant, admissible, and
non-cumulative — testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial ... or affidavits
supported in support [of] the relevancy of discovery requests." DE 324 at 8 (emphasis
deleted). In a supplemental order, Judge Marra stated that the victims "may re-refile these
documents omitting the stricken portions." DE 325. The victims have recently refiled the
documents.
In light of this history, Dershowitz is flatly incorrect when he asserts that "Judge Marra's
Order appropriately precludes the unredacted documents from being re-filed in this case on the
public docket." Confidentiality Motion at 3. To the contrary, the Order specifically permits
factual details about Dershowitz's sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre to be presented in regard to
pertinent matters in the federal CVRA case. And certainly nothing in Judge Marra's Order could
render those documents confidential in this state defamation case, where the central issues swirl
around Edwards and Cassell's good faith basis for filing the allegations. Indeed, the order is not
binding in any way in this case, because it is res judicata only as to Ms. Giuffre (the moving
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 11 of 20
party in that case), not as to her attorneys Edwards and Cassell. See Palm AFC Holdings, Inc. v.
Palm Beach County, 807 So.2d 703 (4th DCA 2002) ("In order for res judicata to apply four
identities must be present: (1) identity of the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action;
(3) identity of persons and parties; and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the persons for or
against whom the claim is made.").
III. EDWARDS AND CASSELL WILL BE PREJUDICED IF THEY ARE
BARRED FROM QUOTING FROM THE RECORD WHILE
DERSHOWITZ IS PERMITTED TO FREELY REFER TO THEM
WHENEVER HE FINDS IT CONVENIENT.
Dershowitz is also incorrect when he asserts that no prejudice will befall Edwards and
Cassell if the records are placed under seal. To the contrary, placing the documents under seal
would permit Dershowitz to continue to misrepresent and distort what is contained in those
records while preventing Edwards and Cassell from correcting those misrepresentations.
Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to details in the records when he has found it convenient to
do so — treating the records as not confidential in any away. One clear example comes from
Dershowitz's recent deposition, where he gratuitously injected into the record a reference to a
portion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit about him watching Ms. Giuffre perform oral sex on
Epstein. And then, having injected that gratuitous reference into the record, he proceeded to try
to rebut the reference with confidential settlement discussions — but did so by mispresenting what
another attorney (David Boies) had said during the settlement discussions. So that the Court may
have the full flavor of the exchange, the narrow question to Dershowitz (by attorney Jack
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 12 of 20
Scarola) and Dershowitz's extended answer are quoted in full — including Dershowitz's
reference to the oral sex allegation that he now argues this Court should treat as "confidential":
Q. [Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the
CVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in
connection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct? . . .
A. Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,
end of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any
way inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever
touched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was
completely aware of that. There had never been any
allegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in
2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.
You, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed
as a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false
allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual
contact with me. I think she's lying through her teeth when she
says that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such
information.
But if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically
lying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put
in a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was
never alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.
I know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's
alleged abuse and that was false. I was never a witness to any of
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something
that you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record
is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to
any abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.
And -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey
Epstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,
which she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,
that even David Boies said he couldn't believe it was true.
MS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal
any conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.
THE WITNESS: Does she have standing?

MR. SIMPSON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Please don't
disclose something that she has a right to raise that objection if she wants to.
MR. SCOTT: Exactly.
Deposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 15, 2015) at 93-95 (attached as Exhibit 1); see
also Deposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 16, 2016) (attached as Exhibit 2) (also containing
discussion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit).
The Court should be aware that within approximately two hours of this exchange, Ms.
McCawley (David Boies' law partner) released a statement on his behalf, which stated that
Dershowitz was misrepresenting what happened: "Because the discussions that Mr. Boies had
with Mr. Dershowitz were expressly privileged settlement discussions, Mr. Boies will not, at
least at this time, describe what was actually said. However, Mr. Boies does state that Mr.
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 14 of 20
Dershowitz description of what was said is not true." Statement of Ms. McCawley on Behalf of
David Boies (Oct. 15, 2015).
More broadly, the Court can readily see from this passage how Dershowitz is willing to
inject into the record a part of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit whenever it serves his purpose — and,
indeed, to characterize the part of the affidavit as "preposterous." But then he asks this Court to
place the underlying affidavit under seal, so that the Edwards and Cassell stand accused having
filed a "preposterous" affidavit without anyone being able to assess the validity of Dershowitz's
attack.
Dershowitz has referred to the court records that he now wishes to have the Court declare
confidential not only in his deposition, but also in his widely-broadcast media attacks on
Edwards and Cassell. For example, Dershowitz appeared on the British Broadcasting
Corporation (the BBC) and was asked about the allegations:
Well, first of all they were made in court papers that they don't even ask for a hearing
to try to prove them. They put them in court papers in order to immunize themselves
from any consequences from a defamation suit. The story is totally made
up, completely out of whole cloth.
I don't know this woman. I was not at the places at the times. It is part of a pattern of
made up stories against prominent people and world leaders. And the lawyers in
recent statement challenged me to deny the allegations under oath. I am doing that. I
am denying them under oath, thus subjecting me to a perjury prosecution were I not
telling the truth. I am now challenging them to have their client put these charges
under oath and for them to put them under oath. I am also challenging them to repeat
them outside of the context of court papers so that I can sue them for defamation. . . .
And I will prove beyond any doubt not only that the story is totally false, but it was
knowingly false: that the lawyers and the client conspired together to create a false
story. That is why I am moving for their disbarment in challenges to be provided to
the disciplinary committee.

Page 15 of 20
Similarly, Dershowitz appeared on NBC's Today Show the morning after Edwards and
Cassell made a filing for Ms. Giuffre, to say that the Edwards and Cassell — and Ms. Giuffre —
were all "lying" in the court documents:
Question from Savannah Guthrie: In legal papers from the lawyers, they say you've
had, in fact, the opportunity to be deposed.
Answer from Alan Dershowitz: They're lying. They're lying.
Question: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.
Answer: And they didn't show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about
my legal relationship with Epstein and I'll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded
that I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would
be a relevant witness . . . . They will be proved — all of them [i.e., Cassell, Edwards,
and Ms. Giuffre] — to be categorically lying and making up this story. And it will be a
terrible thing for rape victims. . . . We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic
relationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged
woman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent
academics. And they're just — again — lying about this. I never saw him doing
anything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.
Today Show, Jan. 22, 2015 (emphases added).
As another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he
seeks to have sealed the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen. They [Edwards and
Cassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money. This is a
disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they ever made this false
charge against me" — i.e., Edwards and Cassell will "rue the day" they ever filed the Joinder
Motion. Miami Herald (Jan. 3, 2015).

Most remarkably, Dershowitz took the public airwaves to represent that he wanted all of
the information surrounding the allegations to "be made public," while implying that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. For example, on the BBC he claimed that he
wanted"everything to be made public":
Q: Would you encourage that it now be made public?
A: Of course, of course. I want everything to be made public. I want
every bit of evidence in this case to be made public. I want every
allegation to be made public. I want to know who else she's accused of
these horrible crimes. We know that she accused Bill Clinton of being on
Jeffrey Epstein's island and participating in sex orgy with underage
girls. The records of the Secret Service will prove that President Clinton
never set foot on that island. So that she lied. Now it's possible to have a
case of mistaken identification with somebody like me. It's impossible to
have a case of mistaken identification with Bill Clinton.
My only feeling is that if she has lied about me, which I know to an
absolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone
else. She's lied clearly about me, she's lied clearly about Bill
Clinton. We know that. We know that she's lied about other public
figures, including a former prime minister and others who she claims to
have participated in sexual activities with. So I think it must be presumed
that all of her allegations against Prince Andrew are false as well.
I think he [Prince Andrew] should clear the air as well.
If you're squeaky clean and if you have never done anything like this, you
must fight back with all the resources available to you. And that's what I
will do. I will not rest or stop until the world understands no only that I
had nothing to do with any of this, but that she deliberately, with the
connivance of her lawyer, lawyers, made up this story willfully and
knowingly.
BBC Radio 4 - Sarah Montague (Jan. 3, 2015) (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g7qbc).
In another widely-broadcast interview on CNN, Dershowitz implied that there is no
evidence supporting the allegations against him:
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 17 of 20
Ask them [Edwards and Cassell] if they have any evidence . . . . They're doing it for
money. She's getting money for having sold her story. She wants to sell the book.
They're trying to get into this lawsuit. They see a pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow. They're [Edwards and Cassell] prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These are
unethical lawyers. This is Professor Cassell who shouldn't be allowed near a
student. This is Professor Cassell, who is a former federal judge, thank God he no
longer wears a robe. He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody who's
distorted the legal profession. . . . Why would he charge a person with a
sterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is
serial liar, who has lied about former Prime Ministers, former Presidents, has lied
demonstrably.
CNN Live (with Hala Gorani) (January 5, 2015). Of course, by placing "the evidence" in this
case under seal, Dershowitz will be free to continue to try and insinuate that Edward and Cassell
— and their client, Ms. Giuffre — had no evidence supporting the allegations against him, even
though a mountain evidence strongly support Ms. Giuffre 's allegations. See Deposition of Paul
Cassell (Oct. 16, 2015) at 61-117 (Exhibit 3); see also Depo of Pual Cassell (Oct. 17, 2015)
(Exhibit 4).
CONCLUSION
The Court should deny Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Alan Dershowitz's motion to
place documents regarding Ms. Giuffre's allegations against him under seal.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve
to all Counsel on the attached list, this 25f-‘' day of November, 2015.

1 people that abused Virginia?
2 A. I told you I never asked her the question. 11:36:21
3 Q. Are you aware that years before December 11:36:48
4 of 2014, when the CVRA pleading was filed, that your
5 name had come up repeatedly in connection with
6 Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct?
7 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form, overly broad. 11:37:16
8 A. Let me answer that question. I am aware 11:37:17
9 that never before 2014, end of December, was it
10 ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any way
11 inappropriately with regard to Virginia Roberts,
12 that I ever touched her, that I ever met her, that I
13 had ever been with her. I was completely aware of
14 that. There had never been any allegation.
15 She claims under oath that she told you 11:37:48
16 that secretly in 2011, but you have produced no
17 notes of any such conversation. You, of course, are
18 a witness to this allegation and will be deposed as
19 a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an
20 entirely false allegation that she told you in 2011
21 that she had had any sexual contact with me. I
22 think she's lying through her teeth when she says
23 that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any
24 such information.
25 But if she did tell you that, she would be 11:38:24
94
1 absolutely, categorically lying. So I am completely
2 aware that never, until the lies were put in a legal
3 pleading at the end of December 2014, it was never
4 alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia
5 Roberts.
6 I know that it was alleged that I was a 11:38:46
7 witness to Jeffrey Epstein's alleged abuse and that
8 was false. I was never a witness to any of Jeffrey
9 Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you,
10 something that you have falsely denied. And I stand
11 on the record. The record is clear that I have
12 categorically denied I was ever a witness to any
13 abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing
14 anybody.
15 And -- and the very idea that I would 11:39:18
16 stand and talk to Jeffrey Epstein while he was
17 receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts, which she
18 swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so
19 preposterous, that even David Boies said he couldn't
20 believe it was true.
21 MS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm 11:39:40
22 not going to allow you to reveal any
23 conversations that happened in the context of a
24 settlement discussion.

11:39:49
5 MR. SCOTT: Let's take a break for a 11:39:51
6 minute, okay?
7 THE WITNESS: I'm not sure she has 11:39:54
8 standing.
9 MR. SCAROLA: Are we finished with the 11:39:57
10 speech?
11 MR. SCOTT: No. If he -- 11:39:58
12 MR. SCAROLA: I'd like him to finish the 11:39:59
13 speech so that we can get to my question and
14 then we can take a break.
15 A. So the question -- the answer to your 11:40:02
16 question is --
17 MR. SIMPSON: Wait a minute. Wait a 11:40:04
18 minute. Wait a minute. Please don't disclose
19 something that she has a right to raise that
20 objection if she wants to.
21 MR. SCOTT: Exactly. 11:40:13
22 THE WITNESS: Okay. 11:40:14
23 MR. SCOTT: Ask your question. 11:40:17
24 MR. SWEDER: Maybe you want to read back 11:40:20
25 the last couple of sentences.

19 A. No -- 19 THE WITNESS: Well, I have no memory of

3 MR. SCOTT: Objection, repetitious. He's 3 CNN Tonight by Don Lemon?
4 done it. 4 A. Yes, I do.
5 A. Why don't we just read back my answer. 5 Q. Do you recall having been interviewed on
6 BY MR. SCAROLA: 6 CNN Tonight by Don Lemon in early January of 2015,
7 Q. Because I didn't understand it, so I would 7 where you spoke about matters that have become the
8 like you to try to give us a direct response to that 8 subject of this litigation?
9 question if you're able to. 9 A. Yes, I do.
10 A. I will repeat exactly what I said. A 10 Q. Did you make the following statement
11 rhetorical means verbal and hyperbole means some 11 during the course of that interview: "As to the
12 exaggeration of the facts for political or other 12 airplanes, there are manifests that will prove
13 reasons, but generally it is truthful in a literal 13 beyond any doubt that I was never on a private
14 sense but perhaps -- it all depends on context. 14 airplane with this woman or any other underage
15 And if you tell me the context in which I 15 OW?
16 used it, I will be happy to describe what I meant in 16 MR. SCOTT: You need to see the
17 that context. But I don't think you can really 17 transcript?
18 answer a question about what two words put together 18 THE WITNESS: No. No.
19 mean without understanding the context. 19 A. That is a truthful statement. I would
20 Q. Okay. Well, we're going to talk about 20 repeat it right now. I've reviewed the manifests.
21 some context. 21 First, I know I was never on the airplane
22 Do you recall having been interviewed on 22 with any underage woman. I know that for a fact. I
23 CNN Tonight on January 5, 2015? 23 have absolutely no doubt in my mind about that. And
24 A. I have no current recollection of -- 24 the records that I have reviewed confirm that.
25 MR. SCOTT: Do you have a copy of the 25 They have Virginia Roberts on a number of
www.phippsreporting.com
(888)811-3408
3 (Pages 185 to 188)
1 airplane flights with Jeffrey Epstein. They have me
2 on a number of flights, none -- let me emphasize,
3 none within the relevant time period, none within
4 the relevant time period. That is, there are no
5 manifests that have me on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane
6 during the time that Virginia Roberts claims to
7 have -- falsely claims to have had sex with me.
8 So, yes, not only recall making that
9 statement, but I repeat it here today. And it is
10 absolutely true. And it just confirms what I know,
11 and that is that Virginia Roberts made up the entire
12 story.
13 BY MR. SCAROLA:
14 Q. Your statement --
15 MR. SCOTT: What page are you reading
16 from?
17 MR. SCAROLA: Page 5.
189
18 Q. Your statement was that you were never on
19 a private airplane with this woman, which I assume
20 was a reference to Virginia Roberts, correct?
21 A. It is, yes.
22 Q. Or any other underage girl?
23 A. That's right.
24 Q. All right. How many times --
25 A. Well, let me be very clear. I have no
191
1 to the transcription, the official transcription of
2 that testimony, was that, quote:
3 "Let me emphasize that the manifests that
4 do exculpate me do not show me flying with Virginia
5 Roberts, they do not show me flying with any young
6 women."
7 That was the testimony you gave under
8 oath. Do you stand by that testimony today?
9 A. The manifests that I saw corroborate my
10 own memory -- my own memory is as clear as could
11 be -- that I never saw any inappropriately aged,
12 underaged women on any airplane to my knowledge that
13 were visible to me at any time that l flew. That is
14 my testimony, yes.
15 Q. Well, that's not a response to the
16 question that I asked. Is it your testimony today
17 that you never flew on a private airplane with,
18 quote, "any young women"?
19 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form.
20 A. By young women, I obviously meant in that
21 context underage women. And underage women in the
22 context of sexuality. And, yes, I -- I stand by
23 that statement.
24 BY MR. SCAROLA:
25 Q. All right. So your -- your clarification

idea who was in the front cabin of the airplane with
the pilots. Obviously what I intended to say and
what I say here now is l never saw an underaged
person on an airplane.
Now, when l -- when l flew with Jeffrey
Epstein to the launch, my recollection is that there
may have been a couple on the plane with their child
who was going to see the launch. But that was
certainly not the context in which I made the
statement.
I never saw any underage, young person who
would be the subject or object of any improper
sexual activities. Had l seen Jeffrey Epstein ever
in the presence of an underage woman in a context
that suggested sexuality, l would have, A, left the
scene; B, reported it; and, C, never had any further
contact with Jeffrey Epstein.
Q. You have also made the statement that you
were never on a private airplane with any underage
women or any young women, correct?
A. The context was underage women in a sexual
context. If it was a -- you know, a four-year-old
child being carried by her mother, that would not be
included in what I intended to say.
Q. Your sworn testimony yesterday, according
1 of your earlier testimony is that you never saw any
2 young women in a sexual context?
3 A. That's not clarification. I think that's
4 what I initially said. That's what 1 initially
5 intended. And that's the way any reasonable — any
6 reasonable person would interpret what my original
7 testimony was. So I don't believe my original
8 testimony required any clarification.
9 Q. So what you meant to convey by the
10 statement that you made when you said you never flew
11 with any underage girl or any young women was you
12 never flew with any underage girl or young women in
13 a sexual context?
14 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form.
15 BY MR. SCAROLA:
16 Q. Is that correct?
17 A. Let me simply repeat the fact and that is,

Q. Mr. Dershowitz --
MR. SCOTT: You're cutting the witness
off.
MR. SCAROLA: He's not answering my
question, Tom.
MR. SCOTT: Well --
MR. SCAROLA: I want to know whether the
last name is spelled the same or it isn't
spelled the same on the flight log marked as an
exhibit and on the photographs. That's a very
direct question. It calls for a very direct
yes or no response.
And this witness has demonstrated a clear
refusal to respond directly to direct
questions, which will result, when we resume
this deposition, in our requesting that the
Court appoint a special master so that this
deposition doesn't take two weeks to complete.
MR. SCOTT: You know, Mr. Scarola, that's
a nice speech and I appreciate it.

5 A. If you're talking about a flight log that
6 I was not on that flight, the answer is yes.
7 Q. All right. Thank you very much, sir.
8 Now, that flight log also shows you flying
9 repeatedly in the company of a woman named Tatiana,
correct?

November 17. If you want to show me any other

1 characterization. And if you recall, months
2 ago I suggested a special master for this
3 deposition, for your clients' depositions and
4 for Virginia Roberts' and your response to me
5 was: I'll consider it, I won't pay for it. If
6 your client wants to pay for it -- so basically
7 you blew me off.
8 So, I appreciate you finally come around.
9 And your clients.
10 MR. SCAROLA: Your client's misconduct has
11 clearly convinced me, having now considered it,
12 that it is absolutely necessary.
13 MR. SCOTT: Okay. Now --
14 BY MR. SCAROLA:
15 Q. So now could 1 get an answer to my
16 question --
17 MR. SCOTT: Now that we have --
18 BY MR. SCAROLA:
19 Q. -- whether the last name on the flight log
20 is spelled exactly the same way as the last name in
21 the photographs?
22 MR. SCOTT: Now that all the lawyers'
23 speeches arc done, read the question back and
24 the witness will answcr it.
25 MR. SCAROLA: I will repeat the question.
1 BY MR. SCAROLA:
2 Q. Did you state during the same interview,
3 the CNN Don Lemon interview: "She has said that
4 Bill Clinton was with tier at an orgy on Jeffrey's
5 island"?
6 A. I did state that, yes.
7 Q. Was that statement intended as fact,
8 opinion, or was it intended as rhetorical hyperbole?
9 MR. SCOTT: Do you understand the
10 question?
11 THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.
12 A. It was a statement based on what I
13 believed were the facts at the time I said them.
14 Various newspapers and blogs had placed
15 Bill Clinton on, quote, "orgy island" on -- in the
16 presence of Jeffrey Epstein when there were orgies.
17 And at the time I made that statement, I had a
18 belief that she had accused Bill Clinton of
19 participating or being -- as being a part of or an
20 observer or -- or a witness or a participant in
21 orgies on what was called Jeffrey Epstein's orgy
22 island. That was my state of belief, honest belief
23 at the time I made that statement.
24 BY MR. SCAROLA:
25 Q. Yes, sir. And what I want to know is what

9 either as an observer or as a participant. The 9 BY MR. SCAROLA:
10 issue was raised on Sean Hannity's program. The 10 Q. Do you recognize a distinction between
11 headlines in various British media had suggested 11 those statements?
12 that. 12 MR. SCOTT: Form.
13 Its my belief that Virginia Roberts 13 A. I don't think that distinction was clearly
14 intended to convey that impression when she was 14 drawn by the media.
15 trying to sell her story to various media, which she 15 BY MR. SCAROLA:
16 successfully sold her story to in Britain, that she 16 Q. I'm asking whether you recognize the

22 perjurious statement, a firm perjurious statement 22 distinction between Bill Clinton being on the

24 on the island and had had dinner with her, the 24 affidavit, and Bill Clinton participating actively

3 A. Her phone number is known to Virginia 3 BY MR. SCAROLA:

10 A. I was asked by you, utterly 10 including Prince Andrew, this would drag my name

19 Q. Well, you have no obligation to respond to 19 MR. SCOTT: Wait.
20 me at all, Mr. Dershowitz, except now while you arc 20 A. I'm convinced that -- that they did little
21 under oath and I am asking you questions and I would 21 or no investigation. They never even bothered to
22 greatly appreciate you responding to the questions 22 call me. That would have been --
23 that I ask. 23 BY MR. SCAROLA:
24 MR. SCOTT: I think he's trying. 24 Q. We'll get to that in just a moment.

2 Q. You made the further statement in that 2 please tell us was there anything other than your
3 same interview, "They dropped the diine on the media 3 inferring that they must have contacted the media to
4 when they filed it," referring to the CVRA 4 support your conclusion that either Paul Cassell or
5 pleading -- 5 Brad Edwards did, in fact, alert the media at the
6 A. Right. 6 time of the filing of this pleading?
7 Q. — in which were you named? 7 A. Yes.
8 A. Right. 8 Q. What else besides your inference?
9 Q. What is the basis for that statement? 9 A. When the BBC came to see me, the BBC
10 A. The basis for that statement was that the 10 reporter showed me an e-mail from Paul Cassell,
11 filing was done virtually on the eve of New Year's 11 which urged him, the BBC reporter, to ask me a
12 on a day that the press was completely dead. And 12 series of questions. So I knew that Paul Cassell
13 nonetheless, immediately upon the filing, I got a 13 was in touch with the British media and was trying
14 barrage of phone calls that led me to conclude, and 14 to stimulate and initiate embarrassing questions to
15 led many, many, many other lawyers who called me to 15 be asked of me.
16 conclude that obviously somebody tipped somebody off 16 And when I spoke to a number of reporters,
17 that they didn't just happen to file -- to find in 17 they certainly -- obviously reporters have
18 the middle of an obscure pleading which didn't even 18 privilege, but they said things that certainly led
19 have a heading that indicated that I was involved or 19 me to infer that they had been in close touch with
20 anybody else was involved. 20 your clients or representatives on their behalf.
21 So, I'm certain that a dime was dropped to 21 Q. What was the date of the e-mail —
22 somebody saying, by the way, you want an interesting 22 A. I don't know.
23 story, there's -- Prince Andrew of Great Britain and 23 Q. -- that you referenced in that response?

15 after your media -- your media appearances? That 15 A. Yeah, that name is not familiar to me but,
16 doesn't call for a speech — 16 of course, I remember doing an interview, yes.
17 A. It came -- 17 BY MR. SCAROLA:
18 Q. — it calls for before or after. 18 Q. All right, sir. And during the course of
19 A. It came before some and after some. It 19 that interview, you said: "There are flight
20 came, for example, before my appearance on the BBC 20 manifests. They will prove I was never on any
21 because they showed me the e-mail before they 21 private airplane with any young woman." Correct?
22 interviewed me for the BBC. So some occurred -- it 22 A. Yes.
23 occurred before some and it occurred after some. 23 Q. Go to page 17, if you would.
24 Q. All right. So it is your assertion that 24 A. Uh-huh.

238 240
1 where Paul Cassell says "asks Dershowitz these 1 interview, you said: "She made the whole thing up

9 would do it by remote when I was in a different
315
10 city. And I clearly did some remotes for Court TV.
11 Q. In fact, you took an apartment in New York
12 for purposes of convenience to facilitate your
13 New York Court TV appearances, correct?
14 A. Totally false.
15 Q. Did you have an apartment in New York
1.6 during this period of time in December of 2000?
17 A. I had an apartment for -- I've had an
18 apartment in New York for 30 -- 30 years or more.
19 But I certainly didn't take an apartment for
20 purposes of Court TV, no.
21 Q. On Tuesday, December n, the entry is
22 1:30, Jeff, correct?
23 A. Right. Yeah.
24 Q. And that's a reference to Jeffrey Epstein,
25 correct?
1 A. We have --
2 Q. So you're telling me that you don't know
3 where she was and that's --
4 A. We just -- we just gave you everything we
5 had --
6 MR. SCOTT: We provided hundreds and
7 hundreds of pages. You're picking out one.
8 BY MR. SCAROLA:
9 Q. Let's go -- let's go to the next page, if
10 we could, please, the third page in this composite.
11 A. The third, okay. Third, okay.
12 Q. And can we agree that this is a calendar
13 from December of 2000?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. Can we agree it's your calendar from
16 December of 2000?
17 A. That's right, yeah.
18 Q. And can we also agree that during this
314
19 period of time, you were making regular appearances
20 in New York on Court TV?
21 MR. SCOTT: Review the document before you
22 answer the question, please.
23 A. It says 12/30, Court TV, yes. There was a
24 period of time where I had a contract with Court TV
25 and I would appear when they asked me to, yeah.

A. 1 know -- I know many, many Jeffs.
Q. Tell me which other Jeffs it might have
been a reference to --
A. I have no idea.
Q. -- on this calendar page.
A. I just have no idea. I would be
speculating.
Q. During the same period of time on
December 12 when there's a calendar entry that
reflects 1:30, Jeff, we know from the flight logs
that Jeffrey Epstein traveled on December 11 from
Palm Beach International Airport to Teterboro
Airport, which is the private plane facility that
services the New York Metropolitan area.
A. I have no idea.
You don't know?
A. No, I have no idea whether he was on that
plane. 1 haven't seen the flight log.
Q. Well, I'm calling your attention to the
flight log. It's the next page.
A. It's the next page here?
Q. Yes, sir.
A. Okay.

5 the exhibit.
6 A. What -- what's the date?

8 Q. December 11.
9 A. December 11. Yes, 1 see that.

14 A. Right.
15 Q. GM, a reference to Ghislaine -- excuse me,
16 Ghislaine Maxwell.
17 A. Uh-huh.
18 Q. And ET and Virginia, right?
19 A. That's what it says, yes, sir.
20 Q. And then we see three of the same four
21 passengers leaving the New York area.
22 A. Uh-huh.

Jeffrey Epstein --
A. And that Carolyn --
Q. — and Virginia were in Ncw York and you
were --
A. And that Carolyn arranged for a massage.
Q. -- having a massage.
A. And that my wife arranged for a massage.
Q. No, 1 didn't say that at all, sir?
MR. SCOTT: Well, that's what he's saying
that the record reflects.
A. The record --
MR. SCOTT: Don't cut him off.
A. -- reflects that Carolyn -- Carolyn always
wanted me to have massages because she thought it
would relax me. ldon't like massages particularly,
but when Carolyn arranged massages, almost always we
had them together at the same time. We would have
the same masseuse, sometimes a man, sometimes a
woman, come to the house and give us massages
together.
The idea that my wife would arrange for me
to have a massage with an underage girl for sexual
purposes is so bizarre and absurd as to defy any
kind of credibility, but go on.
318
1 Q. And let's look at the next page of your
2 wife's diary for December 13, the period of time
3 when the flight log shows Jeffrey Epstein and
4 Virginia in New York --
5 A. Uh-huh.
6 Q. -- at the same time when it would appear
7 that you were in New York. And at the bottom of
8 this calendar, Wednesday, December 13, A.D.,
9 massage, right?
10 A. 10:00 a.m. it says? What is it?
11 Q. It says 10, 10-A.D. massage?
12 A. Yeah.
13 Q. Okay.
14 Let's go to the next composite.
15 A. I don't have -- there's another page after
16 that. Oh, the next composite.
17 Q. Yes, sir.
18 A. Yeah.
19 Q. Composite Number 10.
20 A. Uh-huh. But -- but I just want to be
21 clear. So you're saying Carolyn was with me in
22 Ncw York during that period of time.
23 Q. No, I'm not saying that at all, sir. I
24 suggest that when we take a close look at the
25 calendar, it's going to reveal something other than

0110:55 1 Q. I would like to know why you alleged "and 01:12:55 1 was your basis for this?
01:10:57 2 other minors" given what you have said about your 01:12:56 2 A. All right. So the initial basis for it
01:11:01 3 knowledge of the factual basis, so to speak, for that 01:1100 3 was --
01,11:06 4 allegation. 01:1100 4 MR. SCAROLA: First of all, let me object
0111:06 5 A. Okay. There are going to be -- I'm going to 01:1102 5 because Professor Cassell is not here as an
01:11:08 6 end up giving you nine reasons, each of which is 01:13:04 6 expert witness and hypotheticals are
01:11:11 7 complicated, so I just want to -- if -- if -- I don't 01:1106 7 inappropriate. You're calling for speculation on
01:11:13 8 want to be accused of -- of filibustering or anything. 01:1108 8 his part. I'm not going to instruct him not to
01:11:15 9 I just want you to know that you have asked a broad 01:13:10 9 answer, but it is an improper question.
01:11:18 10 question that's going to require a broad and extended 01:1314 10 MR. SIMPSON: I disagree, but you can answer
01:11:20 11 answer. It -- it -- 01:13:14 11 the question.
01:11:21 12 Q. Answer the question. 01:13:14 12 THE WITNESS: Right. So the -- the factual
011122 13 A. Okay. Then I'm going to refer to a -- I have 01:13.17 13 basis would -- we are setting aside
01:11:27 14 a -- well, actually, I don't. 01:13:21 14 attorney/client communications, right?
01:11:28 15 Q. Let me ask you this: Before you refer to 01:13:21 15 BY MR. SIMPSON:
01:11:30 16 something -- 01:13:22 16 Q. I'm asking: What would you tell the judge?
01:11:30 17 A. Yeah. 01:13:2617 A. Right. So that -- I -- I -- that's
01:11:30 18 Q. -- please give me your best recollection of 01.112818 speculative to -- I don't think I can give a fair answer
01:1134 19 what the basis was, the factual basis that you had in 01:13:30 19 at this point because that would have involved going
01:11:37 20 mind. If the court said to you -- let me put it this 01:113220 back to my client and -- and carving out what kinds
01:11:40 21 way. If you went to court and Judge Marra said, 01:1136 21 of things we were going to present to Judge Marra in
01.11:43 22 Professor Cassell, what's your factual basis for this 01:13:30 22 light of the posture of the case at that point.
01:11:46 23 allegation? Tell me. What would you say? 0113,42 23 So it's a speculative question. I would
01:11:48 24 A. Right. 01:1145 24 have -- let me just -- without going into any
01:11:49 25 MS. McCAWLEY: Wait. Outside the context of 01:1348 25 attorney/client privileged communications, I would have

01:11:50 1 anything that's been communicated to you. 01:13:51 1 provided an ample factual basis for those allegations.
01:11:53 2 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. You have asked two 01:13:55 2 MR. SIMPSON: I move to strike as
01:11:55 3 different questions now, and I need to understand 01:1156 3 nonresponsive.
01:11:56 4 which question you are asking. 01:13,56 4 BY MR. SIMPSON:
01:1158 5 The question that you posed before just now 01:13:58 5 Q. Let me ask it this way: We have talked
01:12:02 6 was: What was the reason for your including 01:14'00 6 about -- somewhat about the basis for this allegation
01:12:06 7 those allegations in this pleading? 01:14.02 7 about other minors. Putting aside information as to
01.12:08 8 Now you have asked: What is the factual 01:14:09 8 which you're claiming privilege, tell me what you knew
01:12:10 9 basis? And that's going back to questions that 01:14:13 9 as of December 30th, 2014, that formed the factual basis
01:12:14 10 we have already covered, and we have, I think, 01:14:20 10 for your -- for that allegation about other minors.
01'12:17 11 exhausted the ability to respond to that question 01:14:23 11 MR. SCAROLA: And I'll instruct you not to
01:12:20 12 outside of privileged information. 01:14:25 12 answer that question for the same reason, that
01:1213 13 Do you want to go back to the question about: 01:14:27 13 when the same question was asked earlier, I
01:12:26 14 What was your reason for including those 01:14:29 14 instructed you not to answer.
01:12:28 15 allegations? 01:1411 15 MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- maybe we are not
01:12:29 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'll ask the question a 01:14:33 16 being clear, Jack. I'm asking him to put
01:1210 17 different way. 01:14:35 17 aside -- I mean, certainly, he -- he filed a
01:12:31 18 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 01:14:37 18 pleading. You've asserted privilege as to
01:12:31 19 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:14:40 19 certain aspects. I'm simply asking him, putting
011213 20 Q. Mr. Cassell, I'm going to ask you: If you're 01:14:43 20 aside whatever you're claiming privilege for,
0t12:37 21 in court and Judge Marra said to you, counsel, what is 01:14:45 21 right, so I'm not -- I'm not asking you right now
0112:42 22 the factual basis for your allegation that Professor 01:14:47 22 to tell me anything you're claiming as
01:1247 23 Dershowitz abused other minors, what would you say? And 01:14,49 23 privileged.
0112:51 24 if you wouldn't say something because it was privileged, 01:14:49 24 BY MR. SIMPSON:
01:12'52 25 then don't include it. What would you tell the judge 01:14:50 25 Q. Tell me whatever is not privileged that

0114:53 1 supports that allegation. 01:16:52 1 began, you know, I guess what we would call
01:14:55 2 A. Okay. The privileged information, obviously, 01:16:54 2 knock-and-talks, knocking on doors to try to get to some
01:14:58 3 you're asking me not to reveal at this point. 01:16:57 3 of these girls, and they would get to the girls, and
01:14:59 4 Q. I'm asking you -- I'm asking you to tell me 0116:59 4 many of them initially were -- were afraid to explain
01:75930 5 the nonprivileged information. And I'm not agreeing 0117:02 5 what had happened.
01:15:04 6 with your privilege assertion -- 0117:03 6 But as they -- as they continued talking to
01:15:04 7 A. Sure. 01:17:06 7 them, the girls began to explain that what was happening
01:15:07 8 Q. -- but for purposes of this question -- 0117:09 8 was, they were going over to Epstein's house under the
01:15:07 9 A. For purposes of this question. 01:17:13 9 guise of giving a massage, and when they got there, the
01:1507 10 Q. -- I'm accepting it. 01'1717 10 massage was, in fact, sexual activity.
01:15:07 11 A. All right. 0117:19 11 And for many of the girls, I think, as I say
0115:08 12 Q. Putting aside what you claim is privileged, I 01:17:22 12 around 23, 24, something along those lines, they were
0115:10 13 want to know everything that's the factual basis for 01:1725 13 underage. They were under the age of consent in
01:15:12 14 including the allegation about other minors. 0117:28 14 Florida.
01:15:14 15 A. Okay. Privileged information which I'm not 01.17:28 15 And so each and every one of those events was
0115'17 16 disclosing in any way would have interacted with a vast 01:17:30 16 a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not
011620 17 body of other information. 01:17:35 17 just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people
01:15:22 18 The vast body of other information would have 01:17.36 18 who were involved there at the mansion.
01:15:24 19 started with an 89-page police report from the Palm 01:17:38 19 And so what the -- the Palm Beach Police
0115:29 20 Beach Police Department that showed for about a 0117.40 20 Department was putting together was that this mansion in
01:15:30 21 six-month period in 2005, there was sexual abuse of 01:17:43 21 Florida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here
01:15:35 22 minor girls going on on a daily basis, in -- whenever 01:17-48 22 in Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this
01:15:40 23 Jeffrey Epstein was in his Palm Beach mansion. 01:17:53 23 period of time, more than a hundred events that they
01:15:44 24 And on some cases, it was going on not once, 01:17:57 24 were able to document of sexual abuse.
01:15:48 25 not twice, but three times during the day. That -- let 0117:59 25 And when you put that together with the

(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400
66 68
01:15:51 1 me just be clear. I mean, I -- I referred to the 01:18:01 1 pattern or practice that was being revealed there, there
01:15:53 2 89-page police report. I have offered to put it into 011803 2 were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the
01:15:55 3 the record if -- if it would speed things up, but let's 01:1806 3 mansion.
01-15:58 4 just talk about some of the things that are in that 01:18:07 4 But then what becomes -- and this is where I
01:15:59 5 89-page police report. 0118:10 5 indicated that, you know, the answer would continue on.
0116:02 6 This was a -- a very intensive investigation 01:1812 6 The -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to
51:18:05 7 that the Palm Beach Police Department put together. 01:1814 7 show that this was a much broader series of events. For
011607 8 They did, for example, what are called trash covers; 011818 8 example, there were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein
01:16:09 9 that is when trash came out of the -- of the mansion of 01:18:21 9 was then flying with underaged girls, and those flight
01:16:13 10 Epstein, the police would intercept the trash and then 0118:27 10 logs, you know, as -- as the flight logs began to
01:16.16 11 they would go through the trash and look for 01-18'29 11 develop, for example, we have seen, I know in the last
01:16:17 12 incriminating information. 0118:32 12 day or two here, one underage girl was Virginia Roberts
0116'19 13 And what they began to discover was memo 0118:35 13 who is on the flight, you know, with Epstein, and with
01,1022 14 pads -- and I say "memo pads," let's be clear, pad after 01:18:39 14 Maxwell, and those sorts of things.
01:1026 15 pad after pad, or I guess I should say, sheet after 01:18:41 15 So you start to look at the flight logs and
01:16:28 16 sheet after sheet that had the name of a girl, and then 01:1643 16 you see what's going on is not just events that are
0016:33 17 there was a notation of something to the effect of a 01:18,46 17 occurring in Florida, but it's occurring on a
01:16:35 18 massage. 01:18:50 18 multi-state basis, which now starts to make it a federal
01:16:36 19 And so the Palm Beach Police Department began 01:18:53 19 crime. For example, we are seeing evidence that --
01:16:39 20 tracking down, well, wait a minute, these -- these are 01:18:56 20 let's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's
01:16'41 21 girls giving massages and they don't seem to have any 01:1858 21 central to this case.
01:16:44 22 specialized training in massages; they don't seem to be 01,18:59 22 We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown
01,16.47 23 masseuses in any sense of the term; what's going on 01:19:02 23 from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of
01:1047 24 here? 01:19.07 24 Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,
01:16:50 25 And so the Palm Beach Police Department 011912 25 many times a week. And not just Jeffrey Epstein, but

01:19:15 1 other powerful persons. For example, Ghislaine Maxwell 01:21:37 1 particular girl had been sexually abused.
01:19:18 2 is there with him on all of these flights and apparently 01:21:40 2 What the Palm Beach Police Department had
01,19:21 3 being involved in the abuse. 01:21:42 3 discovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity
01:1924 4 Indeed -- and so you -- you have -- you 01:2146 4 sometimes occurring as often as three times in a
01:1927 5 have that. You also start to see on the flight logs, 01,21:48 5 particular day. And so that led me to believe that the
01:19:30 6 what to my mind are some very sinister things, 01:21:51 6 sexual activity that was going on in Florida was such
01:19:34 7 suggesting that the pattern is not just confined to sort 01:21:54 7 that someone who was a regular house guest there would
01:19:36 8 of, you know, the girls that are there in Florida, but 01:21:57 8 have immediately come to the conclusion that, well,
01:19:39 9 it -- it is extending more broadly. 0122:00 9 look, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here
01,19A1 10 Like one of the -- to my mind, sinister and 01:22:0310 and they -- they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem
01:1544 11 scary things on the flight logs is, we see, you know, 01:2206 11 to be here to be doing, you know, business activities;
01:19:48 12 Virginia Roberts, who we know has been sexually abused, 0122:0812 they -- they might be here doing other kinds of
01:19:51 13 and we see Jeffrey Epstein, and then we see on the 01:22:11 13 activities. So those would be the kinds of things that
01:19:54 14 flight logs one female. 0122:13 14 would -- would have formed the factual basis.
01:19:55 15 That's kind of an odd notation for a flight 01:22:17 15 There are other things as well, but I'm sure
01:19:59 16 log because, you know, typically, I understand the 0122:18 16 you want to ask other questions in addition to that. So
01:20:02 17 flight logs, the purpose is, well, if something happens 01:22:22 17 I'll stop there, but those -- that's -- I think gives
0120:04 18 with the flight, or there's some question about who was 01:22:24 18 you a small flavor of the kind of evidence that, you
01:20:05 19 on it, you want to know who -- who the person was who 01:22:28 19 know, was form -- undergirding the allegations that were
01:20:07 20 was on the flight. 01:22:32 20 being presented here.
01:20:08 21 So, to my mind, when I started to see on 01:2232 21 Q. It sounds like you quite passionately believe
01,20:10 22 these flight logs entries like one female, I viewed that 012235 22 that there was strong evidence that Mr. Epstein had
01:20:15 23 as a potential device for obscuring the fact that there 01:22:39 23 engaged in sexual misconduct; is that right?
01:20:17 24 was interstate trafficking of underage girls for 01:22:41 24 A. I think "strong" understates it.
01:20:19 25 purposes of sexual activity. Serious federal offenses. 01:2244 25 Q. In the course of that long answer, you didn't

01:20:22 1 But then that evidence extended, you know, 01:22:48 1 mention Professor Dershowitz's name once.
01:2026 2 more broadly than that. The evidence also started to 01:22:51 2 A. I said flight logs. And let's talk about
01:20:28 3 show, again, if we talk just about flight logs, that 01:22:53 3 flight logs.
01,20,31 4 the -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were 01:22:54 4 Q. Let me back up. You didn't answer his
01:20:34 5 being flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro 01:22:57 5 name -- mention his name once; is that -- is that your
01:20:39 6 in New York to -- to locations, just to pick one, you 01:23:00 6 recollection as well?
01:20:42 7 know, for example, in London, where again sexual abuse 01:23:00 7 A. That's correct. We were talking about a
0120:45 8 was occurring. 01:23:02 8 factual basis, and I'll be glad -- I told you that there
0120:47 9 And so you started to put together this 01:23:05 9 were other things if you want, factual basis for -- for
01:20:50 10 pattern of criminality that was started in this -- you 01:23:07 10 Mr. Dershowitz. I'll be glad to add that in. Let me -.-
01:20,54 11 know, I don't know what the right word is here. I don't 01:23:10 11 let's -- let me -- let me -- I would like to supplement
012056 12 want to -- I don't want to -- you know, you've heard 01:2311 12 my answer then if I could.
01:20:58 13 discussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we 01:23:12 13 Q. Do you want to look at a document?
01:21:01 14 have got this nest of -- of -- and I won't say snakes, 01:23:14 14 A. Yes.
0121:04 15 but we have this nest of criminals in Florida, but it -- 01:23:14 15 Q. Let me first -- have we exhausted your
01:21,07 16 it seems to be spreading to Epstein's mansion in New 0123:16 16 recollection without documents of all the evidence that
01:21:10 17 York; it seems to be spreading to Ghislaine Maxwell's 01:23:21 17 you would refer to to support the allegation that
01:21:14 18 flat in London, and -- and -- and it goes on. 01:23:23 18 Professor Dershowitz abused other minors?
01:21:17 19 So those are the kinds of things that would 0123:26 19 A. No.
01:21:19 20 have formed the -- the -- the basis, particularly when 01:23:26 20 MR. SCAROLA: And let me say that you have a
01:2125 21 you -- when you start to add in this fact: What the 0123:28 21 right to refer to whatever documents you choose
0121:28 22 Palm -- going back now to Florida with the Palm Beach 0123:31 22 to refer to, to be sure that you give a complete
01:21:31 23 Police Department. What the Palm Beach Police 0123:35 23 response to the question that has been asked, as
01:21:33 24 Department has -- had discovered was not a one-off kind 0123:38 24 long as you understand that whatever you refer to
01:21:35 25 of event, you know, on one particular day, one 01:23:40 25 is going to be available to the other side, and

01:23:43 1 we would be happy to make it available to you. 0125,38 1 Mr. Epstein saying that she had been trafficked,
01:23:45 2 MR. SIMPSON: And -- and I'll give you an 0125:41 2 sexually trafficked, you know, not just abused by
01:23:47 3 opportunity to look at that -- 01:25:44 3 Mr. Epstein, but now being forcibly sent to, you know,
01:23:47 4 THE WITNESS: Sure -- 01,25:48 4 other people to abuse.
01:23:47 5 BY MR. SIMPSON: 012649 5 And in the categories of people that were
01:23.48 6 Q. -- but I'm entitled to ask first about your 0125:52 6 sexually abusing her were academicians, and I knew that
01:23:50 7 recollection. 01:25:58 7 Mr. Dershowitz fell within that category of -- of being
01:23:51 8 A. Okay. 0126:00 8 an academician. The -- that complaint also indicated
0123:51 9 Q. Based on your recollection -- 0126:05 9 that there might be flight logs that would show that
0123:51 10 A. Right. 01:26.08 10 Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in these
0123:52 11 Q. -- I want to know all the evidence -- 0126:13 11 various locations. And that started to indicate to me
0123:52 12 A. Right. 01:2616 12 that there might be what the law refers to as a common
01:23:54 13 Q. -- you were relying on here. 01:26:19 13 scheme or plan. And that, just as Virginia Roberts was
01:23:55 14 A. So what -- what I'm going to do is, I'm going 01:2623 14 being trafficked to these powerful people in various
01:2367 15 to make a list here on my -- on my notepad of all the 01:2626 15 places, there might well be other girls.
01:23:59 16 things, and then I'm going to compare that with notes I 01:26:28 16 And so I have mentioned a flight log, and let
0124:01 17 have here. There may be a couple things that I don't 01:26:31 17 you -- you wanted to talk about Mr. Dershowitz. On .-
01:24:03 18 cover. 01:26:35 18 on December 30th, 2009, I was aware that there was a
01:24:03 19 Q. As long as your counsel is okay with that. 01:26:39 19 flight log showing Mr. Dershowitz flying with Tatiana,
0124-0420 A. Yeah. 01:26:44 20 who as far as I can tell was not a business person, was
01:24:05 21 Q. You understand you'll have to give that to 01:26:49 21 not providing financial advice or something else.
01:24:07 22 me? 01:26:51 22 I understood that Mr. Epstein was a
01:24:07 23 A. Yeah. I'll give you the notes -- 01:26:53 23 billionaire who was heavily involved in financial
01:24:07 24 Q. All right. 0126:57 24 issues. I knew that Tatiana was on a plane with
01:24:09 25 A. -- and then I will compare with what I've got 0127'01 25 Mr. Dershowitz, and then there was also, if I recall

0124:11 1 there. So I mentioned the Palm Beach Police Department 0127:01 1 correctly, working from memory as -- as you were
01:24:14 2 report. 01:27:04 2 wondering about, there was a notation that
01:24:15 3 The next thing that I want to mention is the 01:27:06 3 Mr. Dershowitz was on a plane with one female.
012419 4 Jane Doe 102 complaint. In August of 2009, Bob 0127:08 4 And so I was -- when I looked at that, I'm
01:24:27 5 Josefsberg -- who is, from what I understood, a very 0127:11 5 seeing Mr. Dershowitz on a -- on a flight with a woman
01:24:32 6 well-regarded lawyer here in Florida; in fact, a lawyer 01:2715 6 who doesn't seem to be there for, frankly anything other
01:24:33 7 that was selected by the United States Government to 01:27:18 7 than sexual purposes or something along those lines with
01:24:36 8 represent a number of the -- of the girls that had been 01:27:21 8 Mr. Epstein, with Mr. Epstein, who is a sex trafficker,
01:24,40 9 sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. He was -- he was 01:27:25 9 and with one female which seemed to me to be a potential
01'24.43 10 part of the procedure that was including the
0127:30 10 entry for disguising international sex trafficking. So
01:24:45 11 nonprosecution agreement. 01:27:33 11 that was of concern.
01:24:46 12 In August of 2009, he filed a complaint on 01:27:34 12 I then began to look at, well, I wonder, how
01:24:48 13 behalf of Virginia Roberts. That complaint indicated 0127:36 13 would I find out if Mr. Dershowitz had been abusing
01:24:54 14 that Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in 01:2739 14 other girls? Let's see. I knew that Virginia Roberts
01,24:58 15 Florida, in New York, and in -- in other places, as I 01:274215 had been forced to -- to -- to -- to do this sort of
01:25:02 16 recall. The thing that -- that I particularly recall 01:27:48 16 thing.
01,25:06 17 was that Mr. Josefsberg had said, Virginia Roberts was 01:27:56 17 MS. McCAWLEY: You're okay as long as
01:2$.12 18 abused by -- and he gave some categories of people. 01:2756 18 you're -- if you're revealing something that's in
01:2515 19 He mentioned, I think, business people. He 01:2759 19 an affidavit --
01:25:17 20 mentioned royalty, and he mentioned academicians. And 012759 20 THE WITNESS: That's right.
01:25:23 21 so to tie into your question, I knew that Professor 0127:59 21 MS. McCAWLEY: -- that she submitted, you're
01:2525 22 Dershowitz was an academician. And so what I was seeing 0127.59 22 fine.
0125:29 23 now was, that according to a very, very respected 01:28:00 23 THE WITNESS: Right. So -- so what...
01:2632 24 attorney here in Florida, he had found Virginia Roberts 0128'05 24 Let's see. What did I want, at this point --
01:25:34 25 to be credible, and had filed a lawsuit against 01:2605 25

0128:05 1 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:29:47 1 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah.
01:28:09 2 Q. Do you want the question back? 01:29:49 2 MR. SCAROLA: -- who keeps jumping up and
01:28:10 3 A. No. I'm just trying to remember what I was 01:29:50 3 down and distracting everybody in the room?
01:28:12 4 thinking about with -- with regard to -- 0129:52 4 MS. McCAWLEY: And there was also profanity
0128:15 5 MR. SCAROLA: Do you need the response read 01'2054 5 used earlier. I mean, we just have to settle
01:28:17 6 back up to the point -- 01:29:55 6 down on this side, and take a deep breath, and
0128:18 7 THE WITNESS: Yeah, if you would do that, 0129:58 7 let him answer his questions.
01:2820 8 yeah. I just -- 0129:58 8 MR. SIMPSON: Look, I mean, the same thing
01:28:20 9 MR. SCAROLA: -- about privilege arose. 01:29:59 9 was happening on the other side.
01:28:20 10 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Let's just see what that 01:30:00 10 MR. SCAROLA: No, sir.
01:2820 11 one -- 01:3600 11 MS. McCAWLEY: There was no profanity on this
01:2821 12 MR. SCAROLA: Just read the last couple of 01;30:00 12 side of the table.
01:28:22 13 sentences back, or the last two sentences. 01:3060 13 MR. SCAROLA: No, no, no. There was never
01:28:31 14 THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. Now I remember 01:3003 14 anyone who jumped to their feet at any time
0128:32 15 exactly what I was thinking. 01:3066 15 during the course of the last two days. The only
01:28:32 16 How would we go find out whether Mr. Epstein 01:30:08 16 person who keeps jumping up is Alan Dershowitz.
01:28:35 17 was lending women, or in this case, underage 01:30:13 17 Have him pass you a note quietly, if you would,
01:28:39 18 girls, to Mr. Dershowitz for sexual purposes? 01'3016 18 please.
01:2841 19 Well, the first thing I want to do was ask -- you 01:30:18 19 MR. SIMPSON: I will disagree with your
01:2845 20 know, I'd -- I'd go ask Jeffrey Epstein. 01:30:19 20 characterization, but let me say the
01728:47 21 And so what I discovered when I started to 01:3020 21 argumentation -
01:2848 22 look at the transcripts, there were a number of 01:30:21 22 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Are you -- are you
01:28:52 23 transcripts where Mr. Epstein was asked about 01:30:22 23 making the representation --
01:28:55 24 Alan Dershowitz. And rather than say, well, no, 01:30:22 24 MR. SIMPSON: No, I'm not.
01:28,57 25 he wasn't involved in any of these illegal 01:3023 25 MR. SCAROLA: -- that somebody on this side

012000 1 activities, Jeffrey Epstein took the Fifth as the 01:30:24 1 of the room jumped up?
01:29:03 2 phrase, you know, to be more precise. He 01:3025 2 MR. SIMPSON: No, no, no, I'm not.
01:29:05 3 exercised his right against compelled 01:3026 3 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Thank you.
01:2966 4 self-incrimination and refused to answer the 01:3026 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not.
01:2909 5 question, which since these were civil cases, 01:30:27 5 MR. SCAROLA: And I appreciate that.
01:29:11 6 indicated to me, since he was being represented 01:30:27 6 MR. SIMPSON: And I --
01:29:14 7 by very experienced legal counsel, that there was 01:3029 7 MR. SCAROLA: And you do acknowledge that
01:2016 8 more than an insignificant risk of incriminating 01:30:30 8 Mr. Dershowitz has repeatedly been jumping up in
01:2919 9 himself if he answered that. 01:30:33 9 the middle of testimony, correct?
01:2920 10 And so Jeffrey Epstein now had taken the 01:30:36 10 MR. SIMPSON: That's -- he just got up and
01:29:23 11 Fifth. And one of the things that I was aware of 01:30:37 11 came over to me. That's the only time I'm aware
0129:26 12 having been involved in, you know, civil 01:30:39 12 of, because I'm -- I'm looking at the witness,
01:29:28 13 litigation and criminal litigation in other 01:3041 13 but he did just do that, and I will pass notes.
01:29:30 14 cases, was that once somebody refuses to answer a 01:30:44 14 We won't get up.
01:2032 15 question like, you know: Do you know 01:30,45 15 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, I will tell you --
01:29:35 16 Mr. Dershowitz? And they take the Fifth on that, 01:30:45 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to take time from
01:29:38 17 that you're then entitled to draw what's called 01:3047 17 this.
0129:40 18 an adverse inference. You can -- you can infer 01:30:47 18 MR. SCAROLA: I will -- I will, for the
012042 19 that, well, if they answered that question, they 01:3049 19 record, as an officer of the court, represent
01:29:44 20 would have -- 01:30:51 20 that there have been multiple times during the
01:29,44 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. 01:30:54 21 course of Professor Cassell's deposition when
0129:44 22 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah, I want to make an 01,30:58 22 Alan Dershowitz has jumped up in the middle of

01:31:08 1 focusing on the witness, but everybody on this 01:33:11 1 review, in which he took the Fifth when asked questions
01:31:10 2 side of the room has been distracted by his 01:33:13 2 about Dershowitz.
01:31:13 3 unprofessional conduct. 01:3114 3 So, at that point, in trying to figure out,
0111:16 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to argue with 01:33,17 4 you know, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in
01:31:18 5 you. And I -- 01:3120 5 sexually abusing, not only Virginia Roberts, but in
01:3318 6 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 01:33:24 6 other girls, then you go down to the next level, next
01:31:18 7 MR. SIMPSON: -- I disagree with that 01:3126 7 layer of the criminal conspiracy.
01:31:20 8 characterization. There is another attorney 01:33:28 8 Epstein is at the top, so you go to the next
01:31:22 9 sitting between us. We will pass notes. 01:3131 9 layer. These are, you know, basically the -- the women
0111,24 10 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 011313 10 who, from what I could gather, were -- were older than
01:31:25 11 MR. SIMPSON: And we -- and I believe, 01:33:36 11 the age that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse. I think
01,31:29 12 Ms. McCawley, were you instructing not to answer 01,3140 12 these were 22 and 23-year-old girls, so they had, you
01:31:30 13 or what was happening? What did you -- what were 01,33:44 13 know, essentially aged out of being his sexual abuse
01:3134 14 you raising? 01:33:47 14 victims, but they continued to -- what they would do is
01:31:34 15 MS. McCAWLEY: No. There was a lot of 01:33:50 15 collect girls for him under the age of 18, that I guess
01:31:35 16 yelling going on here, so I was trying to make 01:33:5316 was in his target range.
01:31:37 17 sure that everybody was quiet -- 01:3355 17 And so what -- so the next person I wanted to
18 MR. SIMPSON: All right. 01:3358 18 talk to, you know, and get information from was Sarah
19 MS. McCAWLEY: -- so that the client could 01:34:01 19 Kellen. Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs
20 answer. 01:3404 20 with, you know, these girls that -- or women and with
21 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Let me back up. 01:34:07 21 Epstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah
22 BY MR. SIMPSON: 0114:07 22 Kellen.
01:3141 23 Q. Professor Cassell, I think you were in the 011411 23 But what I discovered there was that, when
01:31:41 24 middle of an answer? 01:3415 24 Sarah Kellen was asked about Alan Dershowitz, she took
01:31:42 25 A. i was. Yes, if I could conclude -- 01:3418 25 the Fifth, and there was -- she wasn't the only one.

01:31:43 1 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Could the court 01:34:21 1 There was Miss Mucinska, who also took the Fifth when
01:31:44 2 reporter read me the last two lines of your 01:34:25 2 asked questions about Alan Dershowitz.
01:31:46 3 answer? 01:34:27 3 And then there was Marcin -- Miss Marcinkova
01:3146 4 THE WITNESS: Okay. 01:34:30 4 who also took the Fifth. So what we -- what I had at
01,31:46 5 (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read 011433 5 this point was Jeffrey Epstein's international sex
01:31:46 6 by the reporter.) 01:34:35 6 trafficking organization. I had the next echelon, and
01:31:46 7 BY MR. SIMPSON: 0134:38 7 both the top kingpin of the sex trafficking
01:32:26 8 Q. Okay. Can you pick up then? 01,34:42 8 organization, and the next echelon had taken the Fifth,
01.32:27 9 A. Sure. I'll pick up -- pick up the -- 01:34:46 9 had refused to answer questions about Alan Dershowitz.
01:32:27 10 Q. Okay. 011449 10 And so, at -- at that point, I was drawing an
01:32:31 11 A. So I was beginning to draw an adverse 01:3451 11 adverse inference, not just from one person, but from
01:32,31 12 inference when 3effrey Epstein, who is at the heart of 01:34:54 12 four persons, and that adverse inference was being
01:32:34 13 the sexual abuse of, not only Virginia Roberts, but 01:34157 13 strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, some of
01:32:39 14 dozens and dozens and dozens of -- of girls literally 01:35.00 14 which we have already talked about.
01:32,40 15 scattered across the globe, takes the Fifth, refuses to 01:35:00 15 One of the things that -- that really
01:32:43 16 answer the question, off the top of my head, I can't 01:35:02 16 bolstered the adverse inference that I was drawing in
01:32:46 17 recall exactly, but something along lines of: Do you 0135.55 17 this case was that I've mentioned those three girls,
011148 18 know Alan Dershowitz? And he says, I take the Fifth. 01:35:09 18 Kellen, Mucinska, and Marcinkova. They were all covered
01:3260 19 That sort of, frankly, startled me, that -- that this 0115:12 19 by a nonprosecution agreement. And the nonprosecution
01,32:55 20 international sex trafficker was taking the Fifth now 01:35:15 20 agreement was highly unusual.
01:32:57 21 when asked about Mr. Dershowitz. 01:35:17 21 1 -- I had been a federal prosecutor for
01:3101 22 And so I was stymied in trying to get 01:35:18 22 about four years, I had been a federal judge for about
01,33:04 23 information from Mr. Epstein at that point. I think 01,35:21 23 five-and-a-half years, so I had seen a lot of -- of, you
011107 24 there were two depositions, if I recall correctly off 0115:23 24 know, nonprosecution types of arrangements. And one of
01:33:09 25 the top of my head, that -- that I had an opportunity to 011626 25 the things that was very unusual in this one is, it has

01:35:29 1 what I'll refer to as the blank-check immunity 01:37:40 1 that are said there, but Alessi puts Mr. Dershowitz at
01:35:33 2 provision. 01,37:46 2 the nest of this international sex trafficking
01:35:34 3 There was a provision in the nonprosecution 01:37:47 3 organization. Let's see. I think he said four or five
01:3636 4 agreement that said, this agreement will prevent federal 01:37:51 4 times a year, two or three -- you know, two or three
01:35:40 5 prosecution for international and interstate sex 01:37:55 5 days when he goes there.
01:35:43 6 trafficking, not only of Jeffrey Epstein, and not only 01:3766 6 And let's be clear, I know Mr. Dershowitz had
01:35:46 7 of the four women who were identified, but -- and this 01:37:58 7 said at some points like, I'm an attorney, and that's my
01:35:49 8 is a direct quote: Any other potential co-conspirator, 01:38:00 8 client and so forth. And Alessi said, no, but this was
01:35:53 9 close quote. 01:38:03 9 not in a -- in a lawyer/client capacity; this is in a
01:35:55 10 And so that was unusual because what it -- 01:38:09 10 friend capacity.
01:35:57 11 what it seemed to be doing was that somehow this 01:38:10 11 And so now we have Alessi putting him there
01:3568 12 agreement was quite out of the normal and had been 01,38:1212 at the same time when young girls were there. And one
01:36:00 13 designed to extend immunity to other people that might 01:38:15 13 of the -- the -- the things that I picked up, so is
01:36:04 14 have been associated with Epstein. 01:38:17 14 Alessi -- you know, is he able to figure out who these
01:36:05 15 And I knew that that category included the 01:38:19 15 girls are?
01:36:09 16 people that were involved in negotiating this highly 01:38:20 16 A photograph of Virginia Roberts is shown to
01:36:11 17 unusual provision included Mr. Dershowitz, who had been 012822 17 Juan Alessi in the deposition, and he I.D.s the
01:36:14 18 heavily involved, not only in the drafting of the 01,38:26 18 photograph as, you know, V.R., so he -- he had, you
01:36:18 19 agreement, but had also been involved remarkably in 01:38:30 19 know, put two and two together.
01:3622 20 attacking the credibility of these girls and saying 0128:30 20 So now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a
01:36:25 21 things like, you know, it was -- Epstein wasn't 0128:34 21 time when Mr. Dershowitz is also in the house, and
01:36:28 22 targeting minor girls, which just struck -- you know, I 01:38:37 22 apparently spending, you know, two to three nights there
01:36:33 23 was -- I don't want to use a technical term, 01:38:40 23 and doing this four or five times a year.
01:36:35 24 gob-smocked, that a defense attorney with an obligation 01:38:45 24 Now, Alessi wasn't the only one. There was

01:36:42 1 that Jeffrey Epstein was not targeting minor girls, when 01:3863 1 after the time period of Virginia Roberts, but it's part
01:36:44 2 the Palm Beach Police Department had collected, you 01:38:56 2 of the common scheme or plan that we've been discussing
01:3647 3 know, 23 of them that had all given essentially 01:38:59 3 here.
01:36:50 4 interlocking stories about how they had all gone over to 01:3659 4 And so in 2005, Alfredo Rodriguez says, yeah,
01:36:54 5 this house, you know, the mansion, to give a massage and 01:39:02 5 again, Mr. Dershowitz is there at a time when these
01:36:57 6 when they had gotten there, they had been sexually 01:39:05 6 massages are going on. When you start to look at Alessi
01:36:58 7 abused. 01:39:09 7 and Rodriguez's statements in context where they're --
01:3658 8 So the kingpin wouldn't talk. The next 01:39:14 8 they're saying he's there at the same time the massages
01:37:01 9 echelon of the trafficking organization wouldn't talk. 01:3616 9 are occurring, and with the West Palm Beach Police
01:37:03 10 So the next step was to say, okay, let's see if we can 01:39:19 10 Department reports showing that massages are of a sexual
01:37:06 11 find somebody, you know, lower level in there, you know, 01:39:22 11 nature, again, it started to put two and two together.

0127:12 14 criminal organization is doing. 01:39:34 14 had an access to what's been called the little black
01:37:14 15 Now, let's -- let's understand, you know, 01:3938 15 book, or I think he referred to it as the holy grail.
01:37:16 16 given the pervasiveness of the -- of the criminal 01:39:40 16 This was Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, telephone book
01:37:19 17 activity, I -- I wasn't convinced that they were going 01:39:42 17 where he had telephone numbers in it.
01:3721 18 to be able to get in there and start saying exactly what 01:39:45 18 And so Rodriguez had that and, you know, I
01:3724 19 was going on because they might well be exposing 01:3648 19 guess thought that this would be worth a lot of money
01:37:26 20 themselves to criminal -- you know, criminal 01:3650 20 because it would -- you know, it would identify all of
01:3729 21 culpability. 01:3652 21 the people that have been sexually abused by -- by
01:37:30 22 But I -- I was able to read a sworn 01:3654 22 Jeffrey Epstein. And so he tried to sell it. The FBI
01:37:32 23 deposition from Juan Alessi, and Juan Alessi -- I 01:3657 23 busted him for that.
01:37:37 24 think -- I don't know. Maybe just to speed things up 01:39:58 24 And when the FBI busted him, now he's got
01:37:38 25 today, I won't go through all the things that are -- 01:40:00 25 this book. And so the book went to Alessi, and

01:40:05 1 according to a -- to a later FBI report, Alessi 01A2:32 1 a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a
01A0'.07 2 identified information that was pertinent to the FBI's 01:42:32 2 billionaire in this article, billionaire with -- with a
01A0:07 3 investigation. 01:4Z38 3 B, so the record is clear.
01:40:11 4 And so when I look at the little black book 01A2:39 4 But he said, look, if Epstein lost all his
01:40:14 5 that I have seen copies of, there are a handful of names 01:42:43 5 money -- I'm paraphrasing here -- I would be, you know,
01:40:17 6 in that black book that have been circled, apparently by 01A2.44 6 happy to walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk
01:40:22 7 Mr. Rodriguez, and one of the names that's -- that has 01:42:47 7 with him and discuss things with him, as -- you know,
01:40:25 8 been circled is Alan Dershowitz. And so that, to me, 01:42:49 8 even if he didn't have any money.
01:40:30 9 was suggesting that Mr. Rodriguez had identified, you 01A2:50 9 So now I'm seeing Dershowitz is a very close
01:40:35 10 know, Alan Dershowitz as somebody who had information 01:42:54 10 personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein. And then I started
01:40:38 11 about this -- this international sex trafficking ring. 01:42:58 11 to look at flight logs. There were -- there were some
01:40:40 12 But just as a side note, but an important 01:43:01 12 very interesting things that I noticed on the flight
01:40:42 13 note, when the -- the thing that was circled on the Alan 01:43:04 13 logs.
01:40:46 14 Dershowitz page was not a single phone number 01:43:04 14 One of the things I noticed was when I began
01A0:49 15 indicating, you know, somebody had bumped -- you know, 01:43:07 15 to, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was
01,40-51 16 Epstein had bumped into at one point. I believe there 01:43:13 16 wondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs
01:40:56 17 were 10 or 11 phone numbers that were associated with 01'4314 17 come into the possession of, you know, law enforcement
01:40:57 18 Mr. Dershowitz that had all been circled and an e-mail 01:43:16 18 agencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had
01:41:00 19 address as well. 01:4320 19 been provided by Epstein's defense attorney and -- and,
01:41:02 20 So that started to corroborate my sense that 01:4323 20 you know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,
01'41:05 21 Mr. Dershowitz was, indeed, a very close friend of
01:43:27 21 suspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense
01:41:10 22 Jeffrey Epstein. Now, I had then continued to do -- 01A3:30 22 attorney on this rather large defense team. They were
01:41:14 23 there's been reference today to, you know, using Google 01:43:33 23 provided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.
01:41:16 24 to do research and so forth. So I Googled Jeffrey 01:43:36 24 Detective Recarey testified under oath that the flight
01:41:20 25 Epstein and one of the things that pops up rather 01:43:39 25 logs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.

01A1:22 1 rapidly is an article in Vanity Fair. 01:43:41 1 So one of the things that was -- was
01:41:25 2 And what you see in that article is, you 01:43:43 2 interesting is, Dershowitz has had access to these
01:41:28 3 know, discussion about Mr. Epstein, but when you're 01:43:45 3 flight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has
01:41:33 4 trying to do a profile of someone, you try to figure out 01:43:48 4 there been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs
01:41:34 5 who that person's closest friends are. 01:43:50 5 or remove any incriminating information?
01:41:35 6 And so the Vanity Fair author had gone to 01:43:52 6 And -- and one of the things that was
01:41:38 7 Alan Dershowitz, you know, our -- Mr. Dershowitz here, 01,43:54 7 interesting about the flight logs that were produced --
01:41:42 8 and had asked him, hey, what do you know about Jeffrey 01:4356 8 I believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit
01:41:45 9 Epstein? 01:44:02 9 1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to
01:41:46 10 And, again, off the top of my head, you want 01A4104 10 refresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -- you
01:41:47 11 to know what I can remember right now. What I can 01:44:07 11 may not want me to look at documents.
01:41A9 12 remember right now is that in the Vanity Fair article, 01'44:08 12 It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning
0141:53 13 the -- in the Vanity Fair article, Mr. Dershowitz said, 01:44:11 13 during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time
01:41:59 14 I've written 20-some odd books; there's only one person 01:44:15 14 period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These
01A2:03 15 outside my immediate family with whom I share drafts, 01:44:20 15 were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to
0142:06 16 and that's Jeffrey Epstein. 01:44:23 16 the Palm Beach Police Department.
01.42:08 17 So I took that as indicating a -- a very 01:44:25 17 And you wonder why did they stop in
01:42:10 18 close personal association that -- you know, among the 01A4.27 18 September -- you know, why stop in September 2005?
01:42'13 19 people that -- that obviously he's sharing this -- these
01:44'31 19 What's the significance of that? Well, later on,
01A2:15 20 kinds of things that he wants evaluated before he shares 01:44'35 20 additional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,
01:42:18 21 them with the broader world, there's his immediate 01:44:39 21 who shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey
01:42:21 22 family and then there's -- there's Jeffrey Epstein. 01:44:45 22 Epstein? Mr. Dershowitz.
01:4223 23 There was also another similar quote in the 01:44:46 23 So that led to a suspicion that
01:42:24 24 article that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said 01:44:49 24 Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police
01:42:29 25 that he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he had 01:44:52 25 Department flight logs that, the time period of which

01:44:54 1 for the production had been carefully crafted to keep 01:46:33 1 THE WITNESS: Right. No, I mean, I want to
01:44:57 2 him out of it; in other words, to not produce the 01:48:36 2 make -- I want to make clear that there was a lot
01:4459 3 October 2005 version. 01:46:37 3 of information that I was relying on in filing
01:45:03 4 The other thing I -- I began to discover as I 01,46:40 4 this pleading, and -- and, of course, the later
01:45:05 5 started going through some flight logs, Dave Rogers, who 01:46.42 5 pleading. So we are on the subject of flight
01:45:08 6 is one of I think about three pilots that -- that 01:46:44 6 logs.
01:4610 7 Epstein regularly relied on to fly his -- you know, he 01:46:44 7 Flight logs showed that the flight logs
01:45:13 8 had very fancy -- to use the technical term -- jets. 01:4646 8 Mr. Dershowitz had produced to Detective Recarey
01:45:18 9 There were about -- there were about three pilots there. 01:46:49 9 were incomplete and inaccurate. And so that led
01:45:20 10 One of them had some flight logs and that -- 01:46:52 10 to concern on my part that Mr. Dershowitz had had
01:45:24 11 that was Pilot Dave Rogers, if I'm recalling his name 01:46:55 11 an opportunity to sanitize the flight logs,
01:45:26 12 correctly. And so later on in the litigation, the sex 01:46:57 12 had -- had -- had provided incomplete production,
01:45:30 13 abuse litigation against Epstein, flight logs were 01:47:01 13 you know, obviously, very important production
01:45:34 14 obtained from Dave Rogers, and it was possible to -- to 01:47:02 14 that the Palm Beach Police Department was looking
01'4637 15 compare -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to -- I want to make 01:47:05 15 at.
01:4640 16 sure I get -- you know, the question is: How much can -I
01:47:06 16 Then we got some additional flight logs from
01:45:42 17 remember and I'm trying to make sure I get -- get it all 01:47:09 17 Dave Rogers. And what those flight logs
01:45:44 18 in. 01:47:11 18 showed -- first off, let's talk again about
01:45:45 19 And so the flight logs were produced from 01:47:14 19 the -- the production of those flight logs.
01:45:48 20 Dave Rogers. And so Dave Rogers produced some flight 01:4717 20 My recollection is that Dave Rogers's flight
01:45:51 21 logs, and some of the flights that he produced logs for 01:4721 21 logs were provided by Bruce Reinhart who was a
01:45:56 22 coincided with the logs that Mr. Dershowitz had provided 01:47:24 22 former Assistant U.S. Attorney who had been
01:45:59 23 to the Palm Beach Police Department, and there were 0147-26 23 inside the Southern District of Florida Office at
01:46:01 24 inconsistencies. And so that, again, aroused my 01:47:29 24 a time when the Epstein case was the subject of
01:46:05 25 suspicion that maybe Mr. Dershowitz when he had -- 01:47:32 25 regular discussion in that office.

01:4609 2 on the screen. His -- his phone is not working, 01:47:36 2 a -- a law firm or private operation that was
01:4610 3 Epstein's lawyer, Darren Indyke. 01:47:39 3 located adjacent to Mr. Epstein's business. And
01:46:10 4 MR. SIMPSON: Why don't -- 01:47:44 4 so, now, Reinhart, who appeared to be being paid
01:46:15 5 MR. SCAROLA: Do you want to take a break for 01:47:48 5 by Mr. Epstein, and certainly was adjacent to
01:46:17 6 a second? 01:47:49 6 Mr. Epstein's business office, was producing

01:46:17 8 don't we let him finish his answer? 01:47:52 8 So that, again, aroused suspicion that the
01:46:18 9 MR. SCAROLA: Let him finish the answer. 01:47:54 9 flight logs that were being produced would have
01:46:20 10 MR. SCOTT: Yeah, lets do that. You're 01:4757 10 been sanitized or inaccurate.
01'46:20 11 right. 01:47:58 11 But even -- I mean, you know, I think the
01:46:21 12 MR. SCAROLA: Although it may take a while. 0148:00 12 problem with -- you know, you cant sanitize
01:4621 13 THE WITNESS: It -- its, I mean, the 01:4602 13 everything. That would be too suspicious. And
01.46:21 14 question -- 01:48:04 14 so what -- what was -- was -- what was evident on
01:46:21 15 MR. SCAROLA: Yeah. But lets -- 01:4607 15 these flight logs was, for example, approximately
01,4625 16 MR. SCOTT: I don't care. 01:48:11 16 ten flights by Mr. Dershowitz with Tatiana has --
01:46:25 17 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Lets -- let's go ahead 01:48:18 17 has been discussed; with Maxwell; with Jeffrey

01:46:29 20 answer. We heard this much. 01.48:27 20 seemed to be a potential code word for

01.46:32 24 roll. 01,48.40 24 with -- with -- with Mr. Dershowitz, and

01:49:17 10 think we are going towards a waiver here. 01:50:50 10 see if there were other things regarding

01:49:32 2 MR. SCAROLA: And I don't think we are 01:5148 2 There were two things that were of interest
01:49:33 3 getting beyond anything that is a matter of 01:51:49 3 to that: One was that Mr. Epstein, the man that
01:49:37 4 public record. 01:51:51 4 I wasn't able to get information from because he
01:49:37 5 MR. SIMPSON: I just -- I -- 0,51:54 5 was invoking the Fifth, had refused or declined
01:49:38 6 MS. McCAWLEY: But I appreciate you -- 01:51:57 6 to file an answer to that complaint.
01:49:38 7 MR. SIMPSON: Be aware of waiver. 01:52:00 7 Rather than deny the allegations, he had,
01:49:39 8 MS. McCAWLEY: -- letting me know that. 01:5203 8 ultimately, it's my understanding -- I don't have
01:4940 9 THE WITNESS: All right. I will be -- I will 01:52,05 9 inside information and I'm not trying to waive
01:49:41 10 not waive anything, and if I start to do that, I 01:52:07 10 any information, but my understanding is that
01:49'43 11 would certainly request the opportunity to -- to 01:52:09 11 rather than answer the complaint, he settled the
0149:4512 retract what I'm doing, but I was aware -- since 01:52:11 12 case through the payment of some kind of
01:49:48 13 the issue is, well, what's in the public record, 01:52:13 13 compensation that lane Doe 102 found desirable

01:49:52 15 significant United States Supreme Court case 01:5219 15 The other thing that I found interesting is
01:49:55 16 argued in the last 20 years was Bush versus Gore, 01:52:21 16 that 3osefsberg's partner, I believe it is,
01:49:58 17 which was a case that essentially determined who 01:52:25 17 Miss Ezell, had been to some of the depositions
01:50:01 18 was going to be President of the most powerful 01:5229 18 of, for example, I believe Juan Alessi and
01:50:03 19 country in the world. 01:52:33 19 Alfredo Rodriguez. And I believe at least one of
01:50:04 20 There were two attorneys who argued that case 01:5235 20 those, and perhaps both of those. And she had
01:5065 21 in front of the United States Supreme Court, and 01:52:36 21 asked questions about Alan Dershowitz in those

0150:10 23 Candidate, Al Gore, was David Boies. 01:52:42 23 other academics in those depositions.
01:50:12 24 He had put his credibility on the line in 01524524 So that led me to conclude that Bob

01:53102 6 underage girls and, indeed, they were asking 02:09:32 6 Mr. Dershowitz was something along the lines of,
01:53:05 7 questions about what information -- what 020134 7 if I remember correctly, well, tell me what
01:53:07 8 information he might have. 02:0136 8 you -- you -- tell me what you want to know and
01:53:09 9 Another -- I know, I remember now, there's a 02:09:38 9 I'll decide whether to cooperate, was I think
01:53:11 10 whole other line of things that -- that I had in 02:0041 10 the phrase that was used. And -- and so there
01:53:13 11 mind at the time, and I think since you want to 020043 11 was an attempt, you know, a 2009 attempt, a 2011
010316 12 test my memory -- I'm not -- let me be clear. 02:09:46 12 attempt to get information from Mr. Dershowitz.
01:5319 13 I'm not claiming I have a superb memory. I have 02:09:49 13 Then there was another subpoena without
01:53:21 14 an average memory, but this is a subject that's 02:09:52 14 deposition for -- for documents. You know, we
01:5322 15 very important to me, and so I've worked, you 0209:54 15 have heard a lot about records in this case that
01:53:26 16 know, very hard to get all the information. 02:09:57 16 could prove innocence. There was a records
01:53:31 17 I would like to take a break. 02:09:58 17 request to Mr. Dershowitz in 2013. And, again,
01:53:32 18 MR. SCAROLA: Sure. Take a break. 021001 18 my understanding was that there was no -- you
01:53:33 19 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the video 02:1003 19 know, no documents were provided on that.
01:53:36 20 record, 3:27 p.m. 021007 20 And so those -- I had that information.
02:07:43 21 (Thereupon, a recess was taken.) 02:10:11 21 Another bit of information that I had was that in
02:07:4322 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video 021014 22 2011, I believe in early April -- this is not
0208:03 23 record, 3:41 p.m. 02:1019 23 attorney/client privileged information from
020006 24 THE WITNESS: I want to continue my answer. 0210:21 24 Virginia Roberts. This is a telephone call that
02:08:08 25 I'm sorry. I got emotional there for a moment. 02:1023 25 she placed from Australia where she had been

02:08:12 1 I want to do a good job for Virginia Roberts 02:1027 1 essentially forced into hiding by Jeffrey
02:08:12 2 on -- on representing all the -- the evidence 02:1028 2 Epstein. She managed to escape and was hiding
02:08:14 3 that is available to support her. 02:10:31 3 out in -- in Australia, and that she would --
02:08:16 4 The next thing that I was thinking of was, 02:10:35 4 that somehow, you know, Mr. Scarola and
02:08:19 5 all right, then the question is: Well, what does 02:1038 5 Mr. Edwards were able to reach her and there was
02.08:23 6 Mr. Dershowitz have to say about all this? So I 02:10:41 6 a telephone call that was made.
02:08:27 7 started to look at the information on that as 0210:43 7 And in that telephone call she identified
02:08:28 8 well. 02:10:46 8 Alan Dershowitz as someone who would have
02:08:29 9 In 2009, there had been a deposition request 0210;48 9 relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein and
02:08:34 10 sent to Mr. Dershowitz, and I -- I saw a document 0210:50 10 the sexual abuse of underage girls.
02:08:37 11 showing that that had actually been served on -- 02:10:53 11 And so I had that information as well. So
02:08:40 12 on him, and, you know, to the extent that what I 0211,01 12 that, as I understand, the question was: What
02:08:44 13 saw was a -- I think a receipt from the process 02:11:01 13 could I recall off the top of my head with regard
02:08:48 14 server, or something along those lines, so I saw 02:11:05 14 to the factual basis for information connecting
02:08:51 15 attempt to contact him in -- in 2009. 021107 15 Mr. Dershowitz with the sexual abuse of minor
02:08:53 16 And then I saw an additional attempt to 02:11:12 16 girls, plural, and that, sitting here at this
02:08:55 17 contact him in 2011. Mr. Scarola had sent him a 0211.15 17 moment, is the best that I can recall for the
02:09:01 18 note and there was, you know, some back and 021118 18 information along those lines.
02,09:03 19 forth. The -- the one note that -- that jumped 021118 19 BY MR. SIMPSON:
02:0906 20 out to me was one in which Mr. Scarola had 02:1121 20 Q. Was that answer --
02:09:09 21 written to Mr. Dershowitz, I think the phrase 02:11:21 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Before -- before
020912 22 was: Multiple witnesses have placed you in the 02,1123 22 you go on to another subject, Professor Cassell

02:11:41 8 Q. Mr. Cassell, you -- you mentioned that you 02.13:16 8 Q. Could I just see it for one second?
02:11:43 9 had something that you had prepared -- 02:13:18 9 A. Sure. Absolutely.
02:11:44 10 A. Yes. 02:13:21 10 Q. All right. Yeah. Let me just clarify one
0211:44 11 Q. -- that would summarize -- 02:13:27 11 point before you do that.
02:11:46 12 A. Right. 02:1127 12 A. Yes, sir.
02:11:46 13 Q. -- your knowledge. 02:1327 13 Q. In your answer, were you referring to the
0211:48 14 A. Right. 02:1128 14 evidence you could recall or the information you could
02:11:48 15 Q. And now that you have exhausted your 02:13:30 15 recall that supported your allegations as to both

3211:54 17 it -- 0213:36 17 those separately?
02:11:54 18 A. Yeah, sure. 02:13:37 18 A. No, I was not treating those separately. I
0211:55 19 Q. -- as an exhibit? 02113919 was -- for me, there's a common -- what -- what the law

02:12:04 1 THE WITNESS: Yeah. I just want the record 02:1153 1 Q. Okay. So I may have some questions to
02:1106 2 to be clear, that I'm only looking -- there's -- 02:13:56 2 distinguish further between those two --
02:12:07 3 there's a pre-December 30th section and a 02:13:57 3 A. Yes.
02:12:10 4 post-December 30th section, so the top part is 02:1158 4 Q. -- but is it fair to say that -- and I
0/12:13 5 the -- is what I was working off of. 02,14:02 5 realize you're going to refresh your recollection, but
02:1113 6 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:14:05 6 that you had exhausted your recollection of the basis
02:12:15 7 Q. Okay. 021407 7 for the allegation in this Exhibit 2, the motion to join

02:12:19 10 Q. So you're -- you're prepared to produce the 02,1417 10 Q. Okay. So then, now, take a look at that and
02:12:22 11 entire document, but you're clarifying? I don't -- I 02:14:20 11 tell me if there's anything there that refreshes your
02:12:24 12 don't want to ask you -- if you're going to use it in 02:14:25 12 recollection as to something that you have not yet told
02:12:26 13 your testimony, then we will mark the whole thing. 02:14:28 13 me about.

02:12:30 16 MR. SIMPSON: Mark the whole thing and I'll 02:14:49 16 Sarah Kellen was the first name.
02:12:30 17 ask you about it. 02:14:52 17 Nadia Marcinkova, Nadia was the first name

021521 1 people who would have relevant information in the civil 02:1860 1 strategy to sort of stall the investigation to say:
02:15:25 2 cases, but when asked in deposition about 0218:03 2 Well, we will get you Epstein; oh, we can't meet now;
02:1629 3 Mr. Dershowitz, he took the Fifth. 02:18:03 3 oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.
02:15:31 4 So I -- I found it significant that for some 021864 4 And one of the things that I noted from all
02:15:33 5 people, he was willing to answer questions, but with 02:18:06 5 that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,
0215:35 6 regard to Mr. Dershowitz, he took his -- he invoked his 02:18:09 6 never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the
02:15:39 7 Fifth Amendment right against compelled 0218:14 7 Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.
02:15:41 8 self-incrimination presumably because revealing what he 021817 8 Now, obviously, something could have happened
02:15:44 9 knew about Mr. Dershowitz would, you know, cause 02:18:19 9 there. I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what
02:15:48 10 criminal -- criminal charges potentially to be filed 02:18:21 10 was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney
02:15:51 11 against him. 02:18:24 11 trying to get information and unable to do that, I had
021652 12 There was a common scheme or plan, and I'll 02:18:26 12 to make some reasonable inferences.
021608 13 elaborate on that in a moment, but yeah, one of -- so 02:18:29 13 And so one of the inferences I began to draw
02:16:14 14 this was another point. I mentioned that -- that there 021631 14 was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and
0216:17 15 had been three efforts to get information from 02:18734 15 in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I
021518 16 Mr. Dershowitz by way of a 2009 deposition request, a 02:1637 16 don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this
02:16:23 17 2011 deposition request, and further follow-up 02:18:39 17 litigation.
02:16:26 18 correspondence from counsel on that, and a 2013 document 02:18:40 18 What I saw was a stall tactic going on,
02:16:31 19 request all propounded to Mr. Dershowitz that had not 02:18:44 19 and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as
02:16:34 20 gone answered. 02:18:46 20 we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,
021635 21 Yeah, and this was -- yeah, I'm sorry, this 02:1651 21 and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer
0216:37 22 slipped my mind at the time -- but when -- when we saw 0218:54 22 questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.
02:164O 23 Mr. Dershowitz not responding to these answers, you 02:1868 23 And this was back in around -- what was it?
02:16:44 24 know, maybe the mail didn't get delivered to him or 02:19.01 24 I guess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a
021646 25 something like that. I don't -- I suppose that's, you 0219:04 25 decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein

02:18:48 1 know, a theoretical possibility. 02:1607 1 available. And then that never happened, and given the
02:18:50 2 But -- but the reason I ruled out that 02:1511 2 ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I
02:1652 3 possibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly, 02:1612 3 should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.
02:16:55 4 there was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading 02:19:14 4 We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So
0216:59 5 efforts to get information from them. 02:19:17 5 there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period
021762 6 And so let me just go back to the earliest 021621 6 of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer
0217:05 7 instance of that. According to the Chief of Police in 021924 7 any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,
02:17:07 8 the Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department, 021929 8 Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it's just a scheduling issue
02:1711 9 Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available 02:1630 9 and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department
0217:14 10 Mr. Epstein for questions about the -- the sex, you 021633 10 to -- to, you know, to meet and -- and learn all this.
02:17:18 11 know, abuse that was going on. And, you know, 0219:37 11 The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing
02:17:21 12 Mr. Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police 02:19:39 12 here, so now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had
021723 13 Department, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got 02:1642 13 been involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm
0217:25 14 to reschedule it; you know, and then another time, 02:19:46 14 Beach Police Department, but there were others that had
0217:28 15 reschedule, another time. And so there were multiple -- 02:1647 15 done similar sorts of things.
02:17:32 16 according to the Chief of Police, there had been 0219:49 16 So one of them was a Ghislaine Maxwell. I
02:17:34 17 multiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein 02:19:55 17 will just call her Glenn Maxwell. I think that's kind
021738 18 and Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we 02:19:55 18 of the nickname I understand she goes by.
02:17:41 19 will schedule that, and then it hadn't happened. 02:19:59 19 So Glenn Maxwell -- remember, she is -- she
0217:43 20 Now, obviously, there could have been a 021969 20 is the one, you know, I think the record is clear, in --
82.17:45 21 situation there where, you know, an emergency had come 02:20:03 21 in -- in litigation that, you know, an allegation has
0217:47 22 up for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule 02:20:06 22 been made that she was the one that -- that brought
0217:49 23 or something like that. But what I saw was a -- was a 02:20708 23 Virginia Roberts into the -- into the sex trafficking,
0217:52 24 pattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals, 0220:1224 and was heavily involved with -- you know, on all the --
0217:55 25 and that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated 0220:15 25 not all the flights, but on many of the flights with

0220:17 1 Jeffrey Epstein where -- where this seemed to be going 02:2228 I what his excuse was, but, you know, evaded the
022019 2 on and was very close to Epstein, staying at the mansion 02:22:31 2 deposition and, in fact, later information came to light
02:20:22 3 frequently. 02:2233 3 he was hiding out in, you know, in the mansion of
02:20:23 4 And so she would, obviously, be -- I guess if 02:22:35 4 Epstein while he's claiming he's unavailable for -- for
02:20:25 5 you have Epstein at the -- the top of the -- you know, 02:22:39 5 deposition.
02:20:27 6 the kingpin of the operation, Maxwell would be, you 02:22:39 6 So -- so this pattern of Mr. Dershowitz, you
0220:30 7 know, a close second or certainly at, you know, the 02:22:42 7 know, where there were three attempts to obtain
022012 8 higher echelon. 02:22:44 8 information from him, if that's all I had, I guess that
02:20:33 9 So, obviously, someone who would have, you 022246 9 would have been one thing. But what I had was a pattern
02:20:35 10 know, very significant information about, you know, the 02:2249 10 of people who were implicated in this sex trafficking
02:2018 11 sex trafficking, who were the other people that the -- 02:22:52 11 ring evading questions, you know, quite in violation of
02:20:41 12 the girls were being trafficked to, what kind of abuse 0222:57 12 court orders and depositions and things -- I shouldn't
0220:43 13 was going on, you know, what kinds of sex toys were 0222:58 13 say court order -- in violation of the deposition
0220:46 14 being used to abuse them, because I think it was in her 02:23:01 14 notices that were being sent and agreements being made,
0220:48 15 room or -- or adjacent to her room that many of these -- 0223:03 15 you know, through counsel.
02:2052 16 these devices were located, and so she would have had 02:23:05 16 And then in addition to that, I had this, so
02:20:55 17 very significant information to provide. 02:23:11 17 why -- why would you think that, you know, there's this
02:20:57 18 And so in connection with the civil cases 02:2113 18 sex trafficking, you know, ring going on? It sounds
02:21,00 19 that some of the girls had filed against Mr. Epstein, 0223:17 19 kind of farfetched.
0221:02 20 her deposition was set, in fact, by my co-counsel, 02:23:18 20 Well -- well, one of the things that I had
02:21:05 21 Mr. Edwards, and then there was some haggling over a 0223:19 21 available to me on December 30th was a photograph that
02:21:10 22 confidentiality agreement, you know, what are we 0223:22 22 was widely available on the Internet, and that
02:21:12 23 gonna -- and that had all been worked out, and then she 02:23:26 23 photograph depicted three people.
02:21:14 24 was set for a deposition and finally agreed, you know, 02:23:28 24 It depicted Glenn Maxwell, Prince Andrew, and
02:2116 25 to a deposition. 022134 25 Virginia Roberts, and the -- at the time that it looked

02:21:17 1 And just shortly, you know, I think a couple 0223:38 1 like Virginia Roberts was an underage girl. She was not
022119 2 of days before that deposition, she canceled. And well, 02:23:43 2 dressed in formal attire. And Prince Andrew had his arm
02:2023 3 she didn't cancel. Her -- her attorney called to cancel 02:23:47 3 around her, I think if memory serves, and right next --
0221:26 4 the deposition and represented that Miss Maxwell was 02:23:52 4 smiling in the background is Miss Maxwell, and it
02:21:30 5 outside the United States of America and had no plans to 02:23:54 5 appeared that that was a private residence, presumably
02:2113 6 return back to the United States. 02:2157 6 in London, close to Buckingham Palace where -- where
0221:35 7 And so, at that point, the deposition was -- 0224,00 7 Prince Andrew lived.
02:21,40 8 was not able to go forward. But it turned out that she 02:24:01 8 And so here was Prince Andrew with this
02:21:43 9 had not left the United States for an extended period of 02,24:03 9 underage girl with Glenn Maxwell, the -- the right-hand
02:21:46 10 time. She was spotted later at a wedding of a prominent 0224:05 10 girl, if that's the right expression -- I probably
02:21:49 11 person in New York. 0224:07 11 should say -- strike that -- right-hand woman of --
02:21:50 12 And so that was Maxwell fitting into this 022411 12 of -- of Mr. Epstein -- that were there and somebody had
02:21:52 13 pattern of, you know, Epstein was being told -- you 02:24:16 13 taken the photograph.
02:21:56 14 know, the Palm Beach Police Department being told by 02:24:17 14 Given the surrounding circumstances, I
02:21:57 15 Dershowitz that Epstein will answer your questions, and 022419 15 thought perhaps Mr. Epstein had taken the photograph.
02:22:00 16 then, you know, not -- not getting information, Maxwell 02:24:21 16 So that would have shown Virginia Roberts's sexual abuse
02:2203 17 evading the deposition. 02:2424 17 was not confined just to Florida, not confined to the
02:22:06 18 Jean Luc Brunel was another person who seemed 02:24:27 18 New York mansion; it would have -- it would have
02:2209 19 to be very much involved in -- in trafficking the girls, 02:24:31 19 presumably continued into London where one of, you know,
02:22:10 20 and it was the same situation. A deposition was set to 02:24:37 20 the highest, most powerful persons in the governmental
02:22:13 21 try to get answers, you know, who is involved, which 02:24.43 21 structure that -- that exists in England was now
02:22:16 22 girls are involved, what are their names, what's -- 02:2447 22 involved in -- in sexual abuse.
0222:17 23 what's going on? 022449 23 And so that created grave concern about, how
02:2216 24 And so Brunel's deposition is set and then 0224,52 24 far did this sex trafficking ring reach; what were their
02:2225 25 he -- he finagles out of it too. I don't recall exactly 022456 25 connections; what were their abilities to influence, you

00:01:10 5 That information was conveyed to us 00:03:15 5 deposition.
00:01:13 6 subsequent to Professor Dershowitz's sworn 00:03:16 6 MR. SIMPSON: Yes. And we disagree about

00:01:47 18 Is that the position that you're taking? 000337 18 she is asserting her attorney/client privilege

00:01:50 20 you have mischaracterized Professor Dershowitz's 00:03:41 20 any testimony here today, and that I object to

0001;55 22 he made a recording. Yesterday morning, he 000147 22 subject of waiver for her attorney/client
00:01:57 23 provided that information in response to a 000348 23 privilege.

00:0712 3 MR. SCAROLA: Mr. Cassell will follow the 00:0911 3 would object to that.

00:07:52 10 MR. SCAROLA: I understand that. 000034 10 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Let me ask the
000752 11 MR. SIMPSON: Right. We disagree. 00:09:36 11 question, and -- and I will note for the record
00:07:53 12 MR. SCAROLA: I understand, but you can 0009:38 12 that yesterday, the witness testified that the

oo,oe:oi 15 instructions, Professor Cassell will also follow 00:0047 15 being used as a sword and a shield here, but I
0008:04 16 all instructions concerning the assertion of 00:09,48 16 have only asked the question. I'll clarify.

00:08:21 22 that if I ask you what you recall the discussion being 00:09:55 22 Q. But, in any event, my question is: Have you

00:0829 24 you're not going to answer those questions; is that 00:10:02 24 with David Boies about Virginia Roberts' allegations

00:31:27 1 Q. And so wouldn't it be natural for you to be 00:33:22 1 A. Right. The two composite exhibits of flight
00:31:29 2 speaking with -- at least within the realm of something 00:33:26 2 logs I had examined previously.
0011:33 3 one might expect for you to speak? 00:33:27 3 Q. Okay. So the same documents that Professor

0011:38 5 Roberts, that would be the case, but I think you're 00:3314 5 A. That's my recollection, yes.

0011:46 8 this matter. 003146 8 may have also been an earlier review at an earlier --
00:31:47 9 So I think it would be obvious that if 00:3153 9 earlier time, but I definitely remember reviewing them
00:31:50 10 there's a division of labor, it might not be along the 0013:55 10 in May -- approximately May 2014.
0031:53 11 lines that you're suggesting. And I can't go any 00:33:58 11 Q. Would -- do you -- isn't it true that those
0031:55 12 further without going into work product and other issues 00:34:02 12 flight logs support Professor Dershowitz's testimony
0011:59 13 surrounding Miss Roberts' representation. 0014,07 13 that he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts?
00:32:01 14 Q. Has Mr. Boies ever told you that he believes 00:34:10 14 A. No.
00:32:05 15 Miss Roberts was mistaken in her accusations against 00:34:12 15 Q. How do they not? What is -- what is the
00:32:08 16 Professor Dershowitz? 001414 16 explanation for your conclusion in that regard?

00:34:42 1 enforcement agency to provide flight logs relevant to 00:37:16 1 that covered the jet were not just the David Rogers'
0064:46 2 this investigation. 00:37:20 2 flight logs, but there should be flight logs for other
00:34:47 3 And rather than providing all the flight logs 00:37:22 3 pilots which were not apparently being produced.
00:34:49 4 that were available at that time, he appears to have 063725 4 And so, in light of all that, what I was
00:34:52 5 provided flight logs that went from January 2005 through 00:37:27 5 seeing was a -- a production of flight logs that was
00:34:57 6 September 2005, knowing that he appeared on an 00:37:32 6 incomplete. And then I started to hear from
00:35:01 7 October -- I may be off by one month here -- but on an 00:37:35 7 Mr. Dershowitz that, well, these records prove
00:35:04 8 October 2005 flight log. 00:37:37 8 conclusively I couldn't have done that. And I knew to
00:35:06 9 So that, to my mind, had indicated that 00:37:40 9 an absolute certainty, that the records were
00:35:08 10 Professor Dershowitz was providing selective information 0637:42 10 inconsistent and inaccurate; and for somebody who had
00:35:11 11 to law enforcement. Those concerns -- this is, you 00:37:45 11 apparently carefully produced these records, to
00:35:15 12 know, there's -- there's more to it. 0637,48 12 represent that these conclusively prove that he wasn't
00:35:18 13 The other problem was that the flight logs 00:37:52 13 on the flights, seemed to me to be inaccurate
0635:22 14 that Mr. Dershowitz had produced were inconsistent with 00:37:54 14 information.
063526 15 the flight logs that Dave Rogers, one of Mr. Epstein's 0637:55 15 So that was -- those were the kinds of things
00:35:31 16 pilots had, so there were now inconsistencies on these 00:37:56 16 I was thinking about.

00:35,39 18 be surprising that during the period of time where 00:38:02 18 MR. SIMPSON: Well, first of all, I move to

00:35:45 20 appearing on those flight logs. 0638:03 20 BY MR. SIMPSON:
0635,46 21 Now, it is possible, I suppose, and that 00:38:07 21 Q. Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony that you
00,3649 22 seems to be Mr. Dershowitz's position, that the reason 0638,08 22 have sufficient information to conclude and allege that
00:35:52 23 he's not on those flight logs is that he was not on 0638:12 23 Professor Dershowitz falsified documents and gave
0035:54 24 those flights. But given all of the information -- and 00:38:16 24 falsified documents to a prosecuting authority?
00:35:57 25 I won't take your time this morning to go through -- all 0638:19 25 A. It is my belief that Professor Dershowitz

00:36:08 4 which was represented by, you know, vast resources and 00:38:26 4 sufficient information to allege that Professor
00.36,12 5 the ability to produce witnesses and documents and other 00:38,31 5 Dershowitz intentionally provided false information to a
0636:15 6 information that would -- would cover up the existence 00:38:37 6 prosecuting authority?
00:36:19 7 of this organization, had gone through the flight logs 0638,38 7 A. It is my position that he provided incomplete
00:36:22 8 and had made necessary alterations to -- to conceal the 00:38:42 8 information to a prosecuting authority and inaccurate
0636:26 9 scope of -- of the -- of the operation. 0038:45 9 information to a prosecuting authority.
0636:29 10 In addition to that, when I started to 0638:47 10 Now, as to precisely what his state of mind
00:3633 11 compare the Dave Rogers' flight logs with the David -- 063649 11 was when he was producing the incomplete and inaccurate
00:3638 12 excuse me. I am going to get a drink. 0638:52 12 information, that remains to be this -- you know, that
00:36:42 13 When I started to compare the -- oh, I'm 00:3854 13 was one of the topics that I was hoping could have been
00:36:46 14 sorry. I should be looking at the camera. 0638:56 14 covered in -- in the depositions here in the last two
0636:48 15 When I started -- when I started to compare 00:38:59 15 days, but unfortunately, there wasn't sufficient time.
00:36:49 16 the Dave Rogers' flight logs with the Dershowitz -- 00;39:03 16 Q. Let me ask it a different way. You -- you
0636:54 17 which we call them the Dershowitz flight logs, which 063605 17 gave a long answer in which you described reasons you
00:36:55 18 were the logs that he had produced, there were 00,39,08 18 apparently believe that these flight logs were not
063658 19 inconsistencies, and so it struck me as odd that there 00:39:13 19 merely incomplete, but that someone had false --
0637:03 20 were these inconsistent flight logs. 00:39:16 20 falsified them. And did I understand you correctly?
0637:03 21 The other thing that I noticed is, I don't 00:39:20 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. The question that
00:3765 22 believe that Dave Rogers was the exclusive pilot for 00:3622 22 was asked was limited to the time period prior to
0637:08 23 Mr. Epstein. And so I had a concern -- excuse me. I'm 00:3626 23 December 30th. The answer that was given was
00:3713 24 sorry. 0639,29 24 limited to the time period prior to December

00:39:32 1 Are you now asking for an expansion of that 00:42:08 1 Another thing that happened during the

00:39:38 3 gathered since December 30th? 00:42:14 3 deposition, because there was immediately an objection
00:39:40 4 MR. SIMPSON: I will take your objection to 00,42:17 4 from Ms. McCawley, but there were two points in the

00:39:44 7 (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read 00:42:25 7 and I'm not going into any ....-
00:40:05 8 by the reporter.) 00:42:27 8 Q. I -- I just want to say if he starts talking
004006 9 MR. SCAROLA: And I object. The question is 00:42:30 9 about it --
00:40:07 10 vague and ambiguous because it fails to identify 00:42:31 10 MS. McCAWLEY: No, I -- I object to any
00:40:09 11 the time period about which you are inquiring. 00:42:32 11 reference --
00:4009 12 BY MR. SIMPSON: 00:42:33 12 MR. SIMPSON: -- then I get to ask all the
00:40:14 13 Q. Mr. Cassell, as you sit here today, are you 00:42:34 13 questions if he should say anything.
00:40:18 14 prepared, based on the information you have available to 0042:34 14 MS. McCAWLEY: I think he's just
00:40:21 15 you, to assert that Professor Dershowitz intentionally 00:42:35 15 acknowledging that -- I'm sorry. I think he's
00:40:28 16 provided misleading or doctored documents to a 00:42:37 16 acknowledging that that occurred. I object to
00:40:34 17 prosecuting authority? 00:42:39 17 any -- any discussion of any settlement
00:40:37 18 A. So based on all the information I have today? 00:42:43 18 communications in the context of that privilege.
00:40:39 19 Q. Yes. 00:42:44 19 MR. SCAROLA: I don't intend to get into any
00:40:40 20 A. Yes. 00:42:48 20 settlement discussions. We are not going to

00:41:00 4 that. 00:43:02 4 that forth as a basis, he has opened the door.
00:41:02 5 Let's start with the events of the last two 00:43:05 5 You can't put it forth and park and not let
00:41:05 6 days, the deposition of Mr. Dershowitz, which in my mind 00:43:07 6 me ask for all the discussions.

00,41:14 8 Mr. Dershowitz. 00:43:10 8 you know not to include privileged --
00:41:15 9 Let's begin with the overarching point about 00:43:10 9 THE WITNESS: Yes.
0041:18 10 the deposition of the last two days. I've been 0043:13 10 MR. SCAROLA: -- communications.
00:41:20 11 practicing law -- law since about 1986. And in my 00:43:13 11 THE WITNESS: There was a newspaper that
00:41:26 12 experience, I have never seen a more evasive effort to 00:43:15 12 reported -- a Florida business newspaper that
00:41:30 13 avoid answering questions, and to essentially run out 00:43:18 13 promptly after Mr. Dershowitz said that Mr. Boies
00:41:34 14 the clock so that detailed questions could not be asked 00:43:21 14 had made certain representations, a Florida --
00:41:38 15 by my attorney. And I witnessed over the last two days, 00:4324 15 respected Florida business newspaper immediately
00:41:41 16 Mr. Dershowitz was asked a series of very simple 00:43:27 16 reported that David Boies had said, that was a
00:41:44 17 questions; where were you on this day; or what's the 00:43:29 17 false statement.
00:41:46 18 name; or what time, things like that, and instead of, 00:43:31 18 And in light of that, I now had David Boies
0041:49 19 you know, giving an -- an immediate answer, he ended up 00:43:34 19 saying that Mr. Dershowitz was making false
00:4153 20 giving a very extended answer commonly punctuated with 0043:37 20 statements under oath during the -- the
00:4157 21 disparaging remarks that seemed to have nothing to do 00:43:38 21 deposition that occurred over the last two days.
00:42:00 22 with answering the question. 00:43:41 22 In addition to that, I had -- again, during
00:42:01 23 So I drew the inference from that that 00:43:44 23 the deposition, I heard Mr. Dershowitz say that
00:42:03 24 Mr. Dershowitz did not want to answer questions over the 00:43:48 24 Attorney Bob Josefsberg had said that -- words to
00:42:07 25 last two days. 0043:52 25 the effect that he, Josefsberg, did not believe

0044:00 3 represented Miss Roberts based on public 064610 3 that's --
00:4460 4 information, and I knew that that would be a 00:46:10 4 MR. SCAROLA: You can refresh your

00:4464 6 attorney/client obligations. And as a result of 00:4612 6 THE WITNESS: All right. I'd like to refresh
0644:09 7 that, it seemed to me that, once again, 00;46:15 7 my recollection by looking at -
064466 8 Mr. Dershowitz was giving false information under 0646:16 8 MR. SIMPSON: Actually, I -- I object to this
00:4412 9 oath in an effort to exculpate himself from the 00:4617 9 answer as nonresponsive. I haven't heard
064417 10 sex trafficking that he had been involved with. 0646:20 10 anything about flight logs once.
0644:19 11 In addition to that, I learned during the 00:46:21 11 MR. SCAROLA: You can continue.
00:44:21 12 deposition on Thursday that it had, quote, not 00:4623 12 THE WITNESS: These -- you know, these all go

00:44:29 14 a direct quote from Mr. Dershowitz -- to record a 00:46,27 14 BY MR. SIMPSON:
00:44:31 15 conversation with a woman allegedly named Rebecca 0646:28 15 Q. You're looking at a document?

0644:38 18 And then yesterday, Friday, I learned that 00:46:34 18 Q. Did you prepare it?
00:44:40 19 Mr. Dershowitz, not only had it crossed his mind 00:46:35 19 A. Yes, I did. All right. Let's see. At page
00:44:43 20 to make a recording, he had, in fact, made such a 00:464220 114 of a rough transcript that I saw prepared of
00:44:47 21 recording; and in fact, had it transcribed; and 00:46:46 21 Thursday's testimony, Mr. Dershowitz was asked. Quote:

00:45:06 3 The false statements or certainly misleading 0047:07 3 knew that Juan Alessi, among potentially other people,

0645:18 6 grave concern to me. 00:4717 6 and, indeed, had identified a photograph of Virginia
0645:18 7 One of them was that we had propounded an 00:4720 7 Roberts.
00:45:20 8 interrogatory requesting the basis for 064721 8 At page 164 of the transcript, Mr. Dershowitz
00:4523 9 Mr. Dershowitz's statements that Virginia Roberts 00:47:25 9 was asked, quote: All of the manifests that have been
00:45126 10 had a criminal record. And he said that, well, 00:47:28 10 produced in this litigation, the ones that you say
00:45:29 11 she's admitted that she had sex with various 0647:31 11 corroborate your testimony and exonerate you,
00:45:32 12 people, so that renders her a criminal, and 00:47:34 12 demonstrate that you never flew on Jeffrey Epstein's
00:45:34 13 something along those lines, which I didn't think 0647:37 13 plane in the company of your wife, correct? Answer:
0645,36 14 was very accurate. 0647:41 14 No, that's not true. I don't know that.
00:45:38 15 But in any event, that was the answer he 00:47:44 15 And, again, in the context of this litigation
00.45:39 16 gave. And then I learned during the deposition 0647:46 16 where the flight logs have been, as this question that
00:45:42 17 in the last two days, that Mr. Dershowitz had 00:47:48 17 I'm answering tends to show, are so central for
00:45:45 18 received information that he says shows that 00:47:52 18 Mr. Dershowitz to testify under oath that he didn't know
00:45:48 19 Virginia Roberts had stolen money from a 06A7:56 19 whether his wife was depicted on the flight log, struck
00:45:50 20 restaurant and had been criminally charged with 00:47:59 20 me as, at the very least, misleading information, but I
0645:51 21 that. 00.4862 21 concluded in my opinion was actually deliberately false
00:45:52 22 That was not produced to us during discovery, 0648:05 22 information, particularly, given this litigation where
00:45:54 23 even though it would have been obviously 0648:08 23 he has produced, not only his own personal travel
0645,56 24 relevant, and it was directly called for in the 0648,11 24 record, but all of his wife's travel records for the

00:48:15 1 So I thought that was, again, a deliberate 00:50:41 1 logs. And I could refresh my recollection here by
00:48:19 2 false statement under oath designed to exculpate him 00:50:45 2 looking at, I think it's docket entry 291 of our
00:48:22 3 from his criminal involvement in this international sex 00:50:49 3 pleading that we presented on January 21st to
00:48:26 4 trafficking ring. 00:50:51 4 Judge Marra where we provided specific itemized examples
00:48:27 5 At another point in the transcript, he was 00:50:54 5 of inconsistencies between the Dave Rogers' flight log
00:4829 6 asked, quote, -- no, I'm sorry. He stated, quote: I 00:50:58 6 and the -- again, I'll call it, the Alan Dershowitz
00:48:32 7 challenge you to find any statement where I said I have 00:51:01 7 flight log, which was a selected presentation of flight
00:48:35 8 never traveled outside the presence of my wife, close 00:51,03 8 log information.
00:48:38 9 quote, representing that there would be no such 00:51:04 9 And when you see those inconsistencies, it
00:48:42 10 statement there, when, in fact, I'm aware of an American 00:51:06 10 becomes very hard to believe that all of the information
00:48:45 11 Lawyer quotation attributed to him from January 15th, 00:51:09 11 that was provided in those flight logs was accurate. So
00:48:48 12 2015, quote: I've been married to the same woman for 28 00:51:11 12 when I take all of that information, put it together, I
00:48:52 13 years. She goes with me everywhere, close quote. And, 00:51:14 13 believe that there's sufficient -- I have a sufficient
00:48:56 14 again, you know, this -- I understand sometimes people 00:51:17 14 basis for believing at this point in time, that
00'4869 15 may go away from their wife, but the American Lawyer 00:51:19 15 Mr. Dershowitz has, indeed, provided inaccurate
00:49:01 16 was, obviously, on January 15th, 2015, asking about: 0651:22 16 information to -- to law enforcement agencies, or at a
00:49:05 17 Well, have you been outside the presence of your wife in 00:51:25 17 minimum has provided -- has produced inaccurate
00:49:08 18 situations where you might have interacted with Virginia 00:51:29 18 information through circumstances beyond his control.
00:49:10 19 Roberts? And that was the answer that he gave to the 00:51:32 19 But when he continually represents that the
00:49:12 20 American Lawyer. 00:51:34 20 information is accurate and exonerates him, I believe
00:49:13 21 And based on -- on my review of the flight 00:51:37 21 that that is a deliberately false statement.
00:49:15 22 logs, I thought that was, again, a deliberate effort to 00:51:41 22 MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike the answer --
00:49:20 23 obscure and try to exculpate himself from his 00,51:42 23 the nonresponsive portion of the answer.
00:49:23 24 involvement in this international sex trafficking ring. 00:51:46 24 MR. SCAROLA: Which portion is that?

00:49:39 3 deliberately mis -- misleading information and more 00:51:54 3 BY MR. SIMPSON:
00:49:41 4 likely deliberately false information, because 00:51:55 4 Q. Mr. Cassell, you came here today looking for
00:49:43 5 Mr. Dershowitz was aware of the photograph and had long 00:51:57 5 an opportunity to give that statement; did you not?
00:49:47 6 been aware of the photograph that shows Prince Andrew 00:51:59 6 A. If it was relevant to an answer I was giving,
0649:50 7 with his arm around Virginia Roberts, standing next to a 00:52:03 7 yes.
00:49:53 8 beaming Glenn Maxwell who has been involved in this 00:52:03 8 Q. The answer to my question is, yes, you came
00:4966 9 international sex trafficking organization. 00:52:05 9 here today looking for a question to which you could
00:49:59 10 And in the circumstances of that photograph, 0652:08 10 respond with that prepared statement?
00:50:01 11 it seems quite likely that the photographer who took 00:52:10 11 A. I was prepared to give that -- I anticipated
00:50;04 12 that picture was the head of the international sex 00:52:13 12 that a very good attorney for Mr. Dershowitz might ask a
00:50:07 13 trafficking ring, Jeffrey Epstein. And so for him to 00:5215 13 question where that would be relevant. And if that
00:50:10 14 say that only two people knew what went on was, again, 00:52:18 14 question were asked and I was given the opportunity to
00:5014 15 deliberately false information, because I know he is the 00:52:20 15 make that statement, I wanted to be prepared to give it
0650:17 16 attorney for Jeffrey Epstein, and he could have asserted 00:52:23 16 in the most accurate way that I could.
00:50:20 17 attorney/client privilege over that, said, I can't get 00:52:25 17 MR. SIMPSON: I would like the reporter to
00:50:22 18 into my communications with my client about what he was 00:52:27 18 mark as Exhibit -- are we up to 4 -- Exhibit 4,

00:53:00 1 BY MR. SIMPSON: 065568 1 perfectly clear.
0653:02 2 Q. Before Wednesday of this week, you had none 006568 2 BY MR. SIMPSON:
00:5367 3 of the information that you just described about 00:55:08 3 Q. My question, Mr. Cassell, is: You reviewed
00:53:10 4 Professor Dershowitz's testimony, correct? 0065:11 4 the flight logs, correct?
00:53:12 5 A. Correct. 00:55:12 5 A. Correct.
0653,12 6 Q. I'm trying to look at my notes here of your 0055:12 6 Q. You reviewed them in some detail, correct?
0653:28 7 long answer, but one thing you indicated that -- was the 00:55:14 7 A. Correct.
00:53:30 8 fact that Professor Dershowitz gave long answers is 00:55:15 8 Q. Is there any entry on those flight lines -
00:53'34 9 somehow indicative of false answers or perjury -- 00:5617 9 logs that you read as putting Professor Dershowitz and
065314 10 MR. SCAROLA: That is -- 00:55:21 10 Miss Roberts on the same plane?
00:53:34 11 BY MR. SIMPSON: 00:55:23 11 A. No.
0653'19 12 Q. -- is that right? 00:5624 12 Q. And so your testimony about questions about
00,53:39 13 MR. SCAROLA: That is an absolute 00:55:26 13 the completeness and accuracy of those flight logs goes
00:53:40 14 mischaracterization of the statement that 00:55:33 14 to whether the logs are -- let me rephrase that.
00:53:43 15 Professor Cassell made. He did not refer to the 00:55:39 15 The answer that you gave about your question
0653:47 16 length of the answers, but rather their 00:55:43 16 as -- your views as to the completeness of the flight
0653:47 17 nonresponsiveness. 00:55:47 17 logs and whether they may have been changed in some
0653:47 18 BY MR. SIMPSON: 065650 18 ways, goes to whether those logs are conclusive, not
00:53:52 19 Q. Let me -- let me ask a different question. 00:55:54 19 whether they, in fact, support Professor Dershowitz's
00:53:55 20 Go back to the flight logs themselves. 00:55:5820 testimony that he was not on a plane with Virginia
065367 21 A. Okay. 065662 21 Roberts?
0653:57 22 Q. My initial question that got us going down 00:56:03 22 MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to object to the form
03:54:01 23 this line was: Isn't it true that the flight logs 065664 23 of the question as vague and ambiguous. I don't
00:54:05 24 themselves support Professor Dershowitz's testimony that 00:56:08 24 understand it.
00:54:13 25 he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts, the face

00,56:08 25 THE WITNESS: And I won't give a long answer,

205 207
00:54:17 1 of the flight logs support that proposition? 065668 1 but I -- I think, as I previously indicated, you
00:5420 2 A. The face of the flight logs for the relevant 00:5611 2 can't just look at the face of these documents
00:54:23 3 period of time, we can call it the hot period of time or 006614 3 without -- with -- you know, against the context
065425 4 whatever you want, did not reveal the presence of 0656:17 4 of an international sex trafficking ring that's
00:54:27 5 Mr. Dershowitz on those flights, yes. 00:56:19 5 trying to cover up what it's doing. You cant
00. 54:29 6 Q. Okay. So during the period -- well, 00:56:21 6 just look and documents and assume that they are
0654,32 7 actually, there's no flight log that shows Virginia 0656:22 7 100 percent accurate without that -- having that
00:54:34 8 Roberts and Professor Dershowitz on the same airplane, 00:5624 8 context in mind.
00:54:37 9 correct? 00,56:20 9 BY MR. SIMPSON:
00:54,37 10 A. That's my understanding, yes. 00:5626 10 Q. And so am I right, that on the face of the
0054:39 11 Q. And -- 0656.29 11 flight logs, there's nothing showing Virginia Roberts
00:54:39 12 MR. SCAROLA: By name. You're -- you're -- 0066:32 12 and Professor Dershowitz on the same plane?
0654:39 13 MS. McCAWLEY: And it -- 00:56:35 13 A. That's correct.
00:54:41 14 MR. SCAROLA: -- asking whether she was there 0656:35 14 Q. And -- go on.
00:54:43 15 identified by name? 0656:40 15 And so do I understand correctly that your
0654:45 16 BY MR. SIMPSON: 06566716 position is that the flight logs may not be complete or
00:54:47 17 Q. To your knowledge, isn't it correct that 00:57:06 17 may have been changed, but you do not dispute, that on
00:54:49 18 there is no flight log that's been produced in this case 00:57:10 18 their face, they support Professor Dershowitz's
00:54:51 19 by any party that reflects Professor Dershowitz and 00:57,13 19 testimony?

0065:02 23 whether those same names appear on the flight log 0067:16 23 THE WITNESS: Could you just aggregate that?
00:55:06 24 together? 00:57:19 24 BY MR. SIMPSON:
00:55:06 25 MR. SIMPSON: My question, I think, is 0067:20 25 Q. You follow the objections very well.

0057:22 1 A. I was thinking of that as well. 00:5008 1 A. I recall his testimony to that effect, yes.

00:57:25 7 Q. Let me -- let me just ask a different 00:5023 7 it happened?

00:57:27 9 A. Sure. Thanks. 00:59:27 9 charges having been discussed in the Alessi deposition.
00:57:31 10 Q. You testified that you have -- at some 0015901 10 Q. Is it -- well, let me -- let me ask you: Is
00:57:35 11 length, about why you question the accuracy of the 005904 11 it your testimony that you understood that, in fact,
00:57:40 12 flight logs, correct? 00:59:40 12 Miss Roberts had been accused of stealing money from her
00:57:43 13 A. Correct. 00:59:44 13 employer?
00:57:43 14 Q. But I may be redundant, but you don't 00:59:47 14 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the
00:57.45 15 question that what they show on their face supports 00:5048 15 extent it gets into any conversations that you
00:57:48 16 Professor Dershowitz's testimony -- 00:59:49 16 had with Virginia on any of these issues.
00:57:48 17 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection. 005052 17 THE WITNESS: Yeah, I'm trying to -- if your
00:57:48 18 BY MR. SIMPSON: 00:59:55 18 question is about the Alessi depo, I don't --
00:57:50 19 Q. -- that he was not on a plane with Virginia 00:59:58 19 don't immediately recall him discussing --

005804 24 Virginia Roberts are not on the plane, so... otooll 24 Miss Roberts, do you have any reason to question that?

00:58:35 12 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:00:32 12 been arrested and charged with stealing from her
00:58:35 13 Q. What were you about to say? 01:00:34 13 employer.
00.58:36 14 A. I was about to say that the records that they 01:00:35 14 THE WITNESS: When you -- the question built

0058,44 18 A. On -- on their face, I cannot give you a 0100:44 18 What's the basis for your assertion that

011718 16 things. 0119:56 16 Q. It's also true, is it not, that that police

01:18:49 17 about a six-year period of time, and I remember I'd been 01:20:56 17 MR. SCAROLA: -- to isolate -- to isolate his

01:21:16 1 Are you aware that the police report reflects 01:23:34 1 A. That sounds accurate with the information I
01:21:21 2 that the woman I referred to who was hired to give 01,23:37 2 have, yes, she doesn't sound like she would fit his
01;2124 3 massages, told them that she never touched anyone 01:23:40 3 type.
01:21:28 4 inappropriately? 01:23:40 4 Q. And so do you agree with me then --
012129 5 A. I think that there are -- there is 01:23:42 5 A. And she's over the age of 18, which is
0121:32 6 information along those lines in the police report, yes. 01:23:44 6 another reason why wouldn't fit his type, so...
01:21:34 7 Q. Okay. And so do you acknowledge that the 01:2/47 7 Q. But you acknowledge that -- that this
01:21:37 8 police report, on its face, reflects both reports of 01:23:50 8 woman -- that the police report reflects a woman over --
01:21:41 9 massages that involved improper sexual contact -- 01:2154 9 well over the age of 18, being hired to give perfectly
01:21:45 10 contact and massages that were perfectly legitimate? 01:23:57 10 legitimate massages, correct?
0121:50 11 A. Yes, but not in the same proportion. 01:23:58 11 A. Yeah. That was cover for the sex trafficking
01:21:54 12 Q. My question wasn't proportion. The -- the 01:24:01 12 that was going on.
01:21:57 13 report on its face, you understood, reflected that there 01:24:01 13 Q. Okay. So you're now -- does the police
01:22:01 14 were massages given at Mr. Epstein's residence that were 0124:04 14 report say "it was cover" --
01:22:06 15 perfectly legitimate? 01:24:04 15 A. That was --
01:22:08 16 A. Some -- it was basically a few isolated 01:24:05 16 Q. -- "for the sex trafficking"?
0112:13 17 examples from what I could see. 01:24:07 17 A. That was my conclusion when I reviewed the
0122:14 18 Q. So you would characterize what was said in 01:24:09 18 materials.
01:22:18 19 the police report as "a few isolated examples"? 0124:09 19 Q. Okay. So your inclusion is that a
01:2221 20 A. Well, given the backdrop that they had -- 01:24:11 20 fair-minded reader of the police report would come to
012225 21 Q. No. My question -- it's a yes or no 01:24:14 21 that conclusion?
01:22:26 22 question. Is that how you would characterize it? 01:24:15 22 A. December 30th of 2014, knowing what we know
0122:27 23 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. The witness is not 01:24:18 23 now, yes.
01:22:29 24 confined to answering yes or no, if yes or no 01:24:19 24 Q. Do you consider yourself a very suspicious
01:22:31 25 would be misleading. 01:24:24 25 person?

01:22:33 1 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:24:25 1 A. No.
221 223
01:22:33 2 Q. It's a different position than was taken 01:24:25 2 Q. Do you consider yourself a conspira -- having
01:22:35 3 previously, but -- 0124:31 3 a conspiratorial view?
01:22:36 4 A. I mean, I was just going to give one 0124:31 4 A. Absolutely not.
01:22:38 5 sentence, and the one sentence would be, in the context 01:24:34 5 Q. Do you consider yourself a crusader?
01:22:41 6 of this whole police report where they had 24, 01:24:35 6 A. Well, crusader for justice, I would say, yes.
01:22:44 7 approximately, minor girls who were -- who were being 01:24,41 7 Q. If -- let me put it this way: In your view,
01:22:47 8 sexually abused, the references to legitimate massages I 01:24:49 8 is evidence that a person, any person, any guest at
01:22:51 9 would view as isolated. 01:24:54 9 Mr. Epstein's house had a massage, evidence that that
0122:53 10 Q. So you're coming to the conclusion, looking 0125:01 10 person engaged in criminal sexual conduct, contact with
01:22:56 11 at the police report, that they are isolated; is that 01:25:07 11 minors, because of the fact of having a massage?
0122:59 12 right? 01:25:13 12 A. You'd have to look at the context.
01:225913 A. Yes. 01:25:16 13 Q. On its own, is it any evidence -- doesn't
01:23:01 14 Q. And do you think a fair-minded reader of the 01:25:19 14 it -- is it any evidence at all, in your view?
0123:04 15 police report would reach that conclusion? 01:2521 15 A. It would be some evidence, yes.
01:23:05 16 A. Absolutely. 0125:22 16 Q. Notwithstanding that the report, on its face,
01:23:07 17 Q. And were you aware that the police report, to 0125:26 17 reflects both legitimate and illegitimate massages?
01:2112 18 give a bit more detail, reflected that a woman who was 01,25:30 18 A. The report on its face, let's be clear,
01:23:14 19 described as having tattoos was hired to give 01:25:32 19 reflects a lot of illegitimate sag -- massages and a
0123:17 20 deep-tissue Swedish massages. Do you recall that being 0125:36 20 sporadic or isolated, you know, legitimate massages. So
01:23:20 21 in the -- in the police report? 01:25:38 21 the fact that somebody gets a massage in that context,
01:23:22 22 A. Something along those lines, yes. 0125:42 22 I -- I think is -- is -- raises, you know, the concerns
01:23:23 23 Q. And she also -- that woman also told the 01:25:45 23 we have been talking about.
51:23:26 24 police that she was not Jeffrey Epstein's type, that she 01:25:47 24 Q. Did you, before December 30th of 2014,

01:26:07 1 in your testimony yesterday as the holy grail, an 012829 1 Q. Would it be a reasonable inference, or a
01:26,12 2 address book of Mr. Epstein? 01:28:36 2 possible reasonable inference to draw, that
0126:17 3 A. Pieces of it, yes. 01:28:39 3 Mr. Rodriguez was trying to highlight people who would
01:26:18 4 Q. Did you review the entire document? 0128:42 4 be of interest to the Press for purposes of selling the
01:26:21 5 A. No. 0128:45 5 book?
01:26:21 6 Q. Did I understand yesterday that you 0128:46 6 A. No, because he was not talking to the Press.
01:26:25 7 testified -- did I understand correctly yesterday, that 01:28:49 7 He was talking to an FBI agent who had busted him for
01:26:28 8 you testified that the fact that names were circled 01:28:52 8 criminal activity. And so I was assuming that what he
01:26:33 9 indicated that those persons likely engaged in illegal 01:28,54 9 was trying to do, as many criminals do when they are
0126:39 10 sexual contact with minors? 01:28:58 10 apprehended, was give information to law enforcement
01:26:41 11 A. My -- my impression is the names that were 0129:01 11 agency that would be helpful so that they can catch
0126:44 12 circled were circled by Alfredo Rodriguez when he was 0129:03 12 other "bigger fishes" is the phrase that's sometimes
01:2647 13 busted by the FBI for involvement, and he was asked to 01:29:06 13 used, so that the little fish would -- would get off or
01:26:51 14 identify those who would have information about the sex 0129:09 14 get a cooperation deal from the law enforcement agency.
0126:54 15 trafficking organization. And my -- based on all the 0129:12 15 He was talking -- let's be clear. He was
01:26:58 16 evidence I have, I believe the names that were circled 01:29:14 16 talking to somebody he understood was an FBI agent at
01:27:00 17 were those who would have that kind of information. 01:29:17 17 the time, and so that was the context of the
01:27:02 18 Q. So is it your testimony that if the name is 01,29:18 18 conversation.
01:27:05 19 circled, it indicates that they have information, or 01:29:19 19 Q. Do you have any personal knowledge that WS
01:2708 20 that they are criminals? 0128:22 20 in the context of talking to the FBI that Mr. Rodriguez
01:27:09 21 A. That they would have information about the 0129:25 21 circled those names?
01:2712 22 sex trafficking organization, and that would probably 0129:26 22 A. i have reviewed -- I know I could refresh my

01:27:18 24 mean that they were witnesses to what the organization 01:29:33 24 interview of the circumstances surrounding
01:27:19 25 was doing. 0129:35 25 Mr. Rodriguez's arrest, and I believe I reviewed that

225 227
01:2724 2 among other law enforcement agencies, should be 01:29:39 2 Q. Do you know whether the FBI, at any point,
01:2726 3 following up on, if they are trying to piece together 01:29:47 3 contacted Professor Dershowitz to discuss any evidence
01:27:28 4 what the sex trafficking organization was doing. 01:29:53 4 he might have after his name was circled on this
01:27:32 5 Q. Would you agree that a fair-minded person, 01:29:56 5 document?
0127737 6 with that background that you just described, would not 01:29:57 6 A. I don't have personal knowledge of what the
01:27:41 7 go to the conclusion that the fact that a name is 01:29:58 7 FBI did to follow up after that.
01:27:44 8 circled indicates that that person has engaged in 01:30:01 8 Q. Okay. One of the names that's circled in the
0127:46 9 criminal conduct? 01:30:05 9 book is Courtney Love. Do you know who she is?
01:27:48 10 A. They -- what it would indicate is that they 01:30:08 10 A. Not off the top of my head, no.
01:27;51 11 had information relevant to criminal activity. Now, 01:30:12 11 Q. If I mention to you or if I represent that
01:27:54 12 would they on the -- just the fact that a name was 01:3016 12 she's a famous actress, any reason to question that?
01:27:55 13 circled, standing alone, reach that conclusion? 01:30:19 13 A. No.
01:2759 14 Well, that's a hypothetical question because 0120:21 14 Q. In your view, was Courtney Love involved in
01:28:01 15 obviously in this case, there's lots of other 01:30:25 15 sex trafficking?
01:28:02 16 information. 01:30:26 16 A. i don't know.
01:28:02 17 Q. Did you understand -- it is true, is it not, 01:30:27 17 Q. In your view, was Courtney Love a witness to
01:28:06 18 that Mr. Rodriguez was trying to sell that book? 01:3022 18 sex trafficking?
0128:09 19 A. That's true. 01:30,33 19 A. If -- is there a way -- are you representing
0128:10 20 Q. And is it not also true that the people who 0120:36 20 her name is circled?
0128:13 21 are circled are famous people? 01:30:38 21 Q. Her name is circled on the book. In fact, we

01:28:22 23 exactly who was circled, but I know that some famous 01:30:40 23 A. Okay. Yeah.

01:31:09 11 discovery that has various names circled. Looking at 01:39:05 11 A. Yes.
01:31:14 12 the document, I don't see any difference among the 01:3005 12 Q. Okay. And if you would take a look at the --
01:31:17 13 circles. Are you aware of any document -- 0129:08 13 I've marked the entries for Courtney Love. Take a look
01:31:20 14 MR. SCAROLA: Could we have a look -- could 01:39:13 14 at that one.

01:41.00 2 of the -- of the names ball-parking in the dark. 01:43:17 2 Q. But based on your testimony previously, you
01A1:03 3 Q. Do you know whether this address book was 01:43:20 3 would consider all of those facts to be evidence that he
01:4t07 4 Jeffrey Epstein's address book or Glenn Maxwell's 01:43:26 4 may have been?
01:41:11 5 address book? 0143:28 5 A. They are, you know, certainly things that I
01:41:12 6 A. I'm not certain exactly whose book it is. I 01:43:31 6 would want to follow up on.
01:41:16 7 actually thought it was Alfredo Rodriguez maintaining a 01:43:32 7 Q. And --
01:41:19 8 copy of records in case he was worried that Epstein 01:43:34 8 A. If I were running an -- we were in the
01:41:22 9 might try to have him killed at some point, and so this 01:43:36 9 context, I take it, of your question, you know, if
01:41.25 10 was his insurance policy, I think he said, against that 01;4138 10 somebody is running an investigation into the
01:41:28 11 happening. 01:43:42 11 organization, so...
01:41:29 12 MR. SIMPSON: Object to the nonresponsive 01,43:43 12 Q. Did you, in the course of your representation
01:41:31 13 portion of the answer. 01:43:47 13 of Miss Roberts or any of the other Jane Doe clients you
01:41:31 14 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:43:56 14 have had who have had claims against Mr. Epstein, make
01:41:32 15 Q. Is the answer to my question: You don't know 01:43-58 15 any effort to find out whether Mr. Trump had abused any
01:41:34 16 whether it was Jeffrey Epstein's or Glenn Maxwell's 01A4:02 16 of them?
01:41:38 17 address book? 01:44:04 17 MR. EDWARDS: I would just object to this
01:41-39 18 A. i don't know. And the reason I don't know 01:44:09 18 being work-product privilege as it relates to
01:41-41 19 that is because I actually believe it is neither -- 01:44.1019 other cases that I'm working on with Paul that
01:41:44 20 neither of their -- that's -- is it one or the other? 01:44,1220 Jack is not involved in.
01:41:46 21 Actually, I think it's a third possibility. I think 01:44:12 21 MR. SIMPSON: Okay.
01:41:48 22 this was Alfredo Rodriguez's insurance policy against 01:44:15 22 MR. EDWARDS: With respect to what we did
01:41:51 23 getting knocked off by Jeffrey Epstein. 01A4:16 23 during our investigation on behalf of other

01:42:17 5 Q. Donald Trump was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein; 01.44:26 5 to object to this, but because I know of another
01:42:22 6 is that not correct? 0144'28 6 case that we work on, that's protected by our

01:42:26 8 but I -- I don't have a lot of information about Trump. 01:44:32 8 did not.
01:42:29 9 Q. Its true also, is it not, that Mr. Trump was 0144:32 9 THE WITNESS: I'd like to --
01:42:34 10 a frequent visitor to Mr. Epstein's residence? 01:44:32 10 MR. SCAROLA: In that case, I instruct you

01:42'41 12 don't have a lot of information about Trump. 01:44.34 12 THE WITNESS: All right.
01:42:43 13 Q. And his name is circled in this book; is it 01•44.37 13 MR. SIMPSON: All right. You're here,
01:42:47 14 not? 01.44.39 14 Mr. Edwards, as a client, not an attorney,
01-42:47 15 A. I believe it is. 01-44:41 15 correct?
01:42:48 16 Q. Based on him -- assuming he's a frequent 01:44:42 16 MR. EDWARDS: Yes. That's my primary role in
01:42:5217 visitor to Mr. Epstein's home, and that he's a friend of 01:44:44 17 being here, but I'm going to protect the
01:43:00 18 Mr. Epstein's, and that his name is circled in this 01:44:46 18 privilege to the extent that it's not being

01:49:39 1 MR. SCAROLA: Could I ask for a 01:51:23 1 context, in other words, information that was
01:49:40 2 clarification? Are you looking only for direct 01:51:25 2 going to be disclosed, not for advice, but
01:49:42 3 evidence and you want to exclude the 01:5126 3 factual information that she intended to
01:49:44 4 circumstantial evidence? Is that the way you 01751:28 4 disclose, that's no -- that's not privileged.
01A9A6 5 want to -- 01:51:30 5 But if it's something that she communicated to
01:49:46 6 MR. SIMPSON: I'm asking. You can object to 01:51:32 6 you in confidence with respect to getting legal
01:49:48 7 the form. 01:51:36 7 advice, then that would be privileged.
01:49:48 8 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01,51:39 8 THE WITNESS: Right. Okay. So Juan Alessi's
01:49:48 9 Q. My question is: What was -- what were you -- 01:51:45 9 deposition, Alfredo Rodriguez's deposition, and
01:49:51 10 what did you have in mind as supporting your conclusion 01:51A9 10 then considerable circumstantial evidence which
01A9:57 11 or belief that he -- that Professor Dershowitz visited 01:51:52 11 we don't have to rehash here involving the close
01:50:02 12 three to five times during that relevant period? 01:51:55 12 personal association between Epstein and
01:50:04 13 MS. McCAWLEY: And I'm sorry. Can I just 01:52:00 13 Dershowitz.
01:50:06 14 place an objection on the record. I'm going to 01:52:00 14 I mean, again, we can rehash all of that, but
01:50:07 15 object to the extent that -- so that you do not 01;52:03 15 those were -- those are -- that's kind of a
01:5010 16 reveal attorney/client privileged communication, 01:52:04 16 quick -- because I know you want to get to a lot
01:50:12 17 unless it's something that's already public that 01:52:06 17 of questions -- that's a quick sort of highlight
01:50:15 18 she's revealed. 01:52:09 18 film, if you will.
01:50:15 19 THE WITNESS: Okay. Right. So I'm going to 01:5209 19 BY MR. SIMPSON:
01:50:17 20 just exclude -- I take it your question isn't 01:5211 20 Q. Mr. Cassell, isn't it true that Mr. Rodriguez
01:5019 21 asking about any communications. 01:52:14 21 was not hired until several years after the Summer --
01:50:19 22 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:52:19 22 A. 2004.
01:50:22 23 Q. My question is asking about that, but I 01:52:20 23 Q. Let me ask it again.
01:50:24 24 understand you're going to refuse to provide it. 01:5221 24 -- until well after 2002?
01:50:25 25 MS. McCAWLEY: Unless it's already public. 01:52:22 25 A. Yeah, about 2004.

01:50:28 1 THE WITNESS: Okay. So as of December 30th, 01:5223 1 Q. And Mr. Rodriguez would have no personal
01:50:30 2 I'm going to exclude any communications from 01:5228 2 knowledge of how often Professor Dershowitz visited
01:50:33 3 Virginia Roberts from -- 01,52:31 3 during a period two years or three years before he was
01:50:34 4 MR. SCAROLA: Except to extent that they have 01:52:34 4 hired; isn't that true?
01:50:37 5 already been made public. That is, if she has 01:52:35 5 A. So, look, this is -- this is why I was trying
0150:39 6 given express permission to make disclosures, 01,52:37 6 to speed up the answer to the question. We have a sex
01:50:43 7 these were not confidential communications, but 01:52:41 7 trafficking organization that is running a common scheme
0150:46 8 communications intended to be communicated to 01:52:43 8 and plan that is continuing on until it was interrupted
01:50:48 9 third parties, then you are permitted to include 01:52:45 9 by law enforcement about 2005 and 2006.
01:50:52 10 information from Virginia Roberts in your 01:52:49 10 So what the -- the criminal organization is
01150:54 11 response to that extent. And I -- go ahead. 01:52:51 11 doing in 2004, unless I have some significant evidence
01:51M 12 THE WITNESS: Okay. 01:52:54 12 that it's different than what was going on in 2002,
01:51:00 13 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:52:58 13 2001, 2000, 1999, I think it's reasonable to conclude
01:51:00 14 Q. As of December -- 01:53:01 14 that the same sort of criminal activities are going on
01:5101 15 A. Right. 01.53:03 15 later.
01:51:03 16 Q. -- 30th, 2014 -- 0153:04 16 So if -- if you want -- if you want me to get
01:51:06 17 A. Right. 01,53:07 17 into the -- the full scope of the criminal organization,
01.51:06 18 Q. -- correct? So -- 01:53:09 18 we can get into it. But the fact that somebody in 2004
01:51:06 19 A. Yeah, that's right. 01:5313 19 sees this going on, leads me to conclude that it's
01:51:07 20 Q. -- any -- any public statements by her after 01'53:16 20 probably the same thing going on in the absence of other
01,51:10 21 December 30th, 2014 would not be included in the answer. 01:53:19 21 information in 2001.
01:51:14 22 A. Okay. 01:53:21 22 Q. So from Mr. Rodriguez's testimony about what
01:51:14 23 MS. McCAWLEY: But let me be clear. Let me 01:53:28 23 was going on, so to speak -- and my question related,
01:51:16 24 be clear about my objection. To the extent that 01;5132 24 what was going on the number of times that Professor
01,51:18 25 she revealed something to you in a nonprivileged 01753:35 25 Dershowitz visited. That's the topic.

01:54:07 11 organization. I mean, if you want to get into the 01:55:49 11 its fair to draw an inference about how often he

01:5413 13 which, you know, Dershowitz identifies himself -- 01:55:56 13 A. In the circumstances of this case,
01:54:15 14 Q. Let me interrupt you because I'm asking -- 01:5659 14 absolutely.
01:54:15 15 A. Okay. 01:55:59 15 Q. And would it be fair to infer from the number
0164:18 16 Q. -- about -- my only question is evidence of 01666316 of times that Donald Trump visited three years later,
0164:18 17 how -- not anything, whether engaged in conduct or 01:5608 17 how often he visited at an earlier period?
01:54:23 18 didn't engage in conduct, just how many times he came 01:56:09 18 A. I did not investigate the circumstances
01:54:26 19 during this period. 01:56:12 19 involving Trump. He wasn't somebody that was coming up.
01:54:26 20 A. Right. 0166.16 20 Q. Were you aware on December 30th of 2014 that
01:5426 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. That's the 01:5625 21 Donald Trump was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying: "I've
01:54:28 22 reason why I asked you to clarify whether you 01:5628 22 known Jeff" -- referring to Epstein -- oh, I'm sorry.

01:54:39 1 circumstantial evidence is good evidence. A 01:5644 1 of fun to be with." It even said that: "He likes
01:54:42 2 well-connected chain of circumstance can be -- 01:56:47 2 beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on
01:54:45 3 MR. SIMPSON: We really don't need a speech. 016662 3 the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys the
01:54:47 4 MR. SCAROLA: -- a well-connected -- 01:56:56 4 social -- social life"? Were you aware of that on
01:54,17 5 MR. SIMPSON: We really don't -- 01:58:57 5 December 30th, 2014?
5164:48 6 MR. SCAROLA: -- chain of circumstance may be 01:5668 6 A. Possibly. I mean that sounds vaguely
01:54:49 7 as compelling proof as direct evidence of a given 01:57:01 7 familiar. Trump has just not been somebody that -- that
01:5463 8 fact. That's the law. 01:57:05 8 I've paid much attention to in this case.
01:54:55 9 If you don't want -- 01:57:07 9 Q. Based on that statement, and the facts we
01:54:57 10 MR. SIMPSON: Really, sir. 01:57.14 10 discussed earlier about Mr. Trump visiting and being a
01:54:55 11 MR. SCAROLA: -- the circumstantial 01,57:21 11 friend, and the other circumstances we discussed, are

01:54:57 13 MR. SIMPSON: Mr. Scarola -- 01:57:27 13 misconduct with minors?
01:54:57 14 MR. SCAROLA: -- tell us that. 01:57:29 14 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the
0164:58 15 MR. SIMPSON: -- please don't make speeches, 01:57:30 15 extent that you can't reveal anything that my
01.54:59 16 and please don't coach the witness. 01:57:31 16 client has informed you of.
01:5501 17 MR. SCAROLA: Just tell us that. I'm not 01:57:33 17 THE WITNESS: Right. If we set aside that
01:5602 18 coaching the witness. I'm asking you -- you're 01:57:35 18 information, I'm not -- I'm not suspicious, no,
016606 19 asking ambiguous questions. 0167:39 19 not given the information I have.
016608 20 MR. SIMPSON: There's nothing ambiguous -- 01:57:39 20 BY MR. SIMPSON:
0165:09 21 MR. SCAROLA: If you want only direct 01:57:40 21 Q. Okay. So notwithstanding that his name is
0165:10 22 evidence, we will give you only direct evidence. 01:57:42 22 circled in the address book, he was a good friend, he
01:55:13 23 If you want a full and complete answer, it's 01:57:49 23 visited often, and he was quoted as saying that Jeff was

01:58:06 3 The fact that his name is circled, if I were 02:0016 3 is your best estimate of how much money you have made

01:5047 16 misconduct? 0200:44 16 A. Okay. I need to --
0168.47 17 A. So... 02:0046 17 MR. SIMPSON: There's a question pending. I
01:5048 18 Q. Yes or no. It's a yes or no question. 02:00:47 18 object to a break. There's no possible

02:16:50 8 much money you have made representing victims of Jeffrey 0219:03 8 Q. All right. How many of those cases have been

02:16:56 10 A. In which case are we talking about? 021906 10 A. Ali. All -- of the four, I recall all four
02:1608 11 Q. In -- in any case. Combined total. 021908 11 have been resolved.
02:17:01 12 A. Okay. With regard to the CVRA case, that's 02:19:09 12 Q. Okay. Without telling me the amount, did you

0/2059 10 Q. Unresolved cases seeking money from Jeffrey 02:2357 10 Q. Well, wait -- I don't want to -- you know,
02:21:02 11 Epstein. 022309 11 let me ask the question --
022152 12 MR. SCAROLA: And to the extent that that 02:23:09 12 A. Yeah.
022153 13 question calls for matters that are of public 0223:10 13 Q. -- rather than my recollection.

02:21:08 15 THE WITNESS: Right. Yeah. None. 022312 15 Q. My question is: Do you anticipate that if
02:21:09 16 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:23:15 16 you're successful in setting aside the nonprosecution
02:21:10 17 Q. Are there -- and I'm not asking for the name. 0223:18 17 agreement, that the names of additional victims will
02:21:11 18 Are there any not of public record that -- 02:232318 become known?
0121:15 19 A. What would be a "not"? 02:23:24 19 A. Additional Epstein victims at this point?

02:21:21 24 A. Yeah. No, I don't -- I don't think there's 0223:38 24 that there might be somebody additional that would come
02:21:25 25 anything. Yeah, no -- no claims against Epstein, right. 02:23:40 25 forward, but that hasn't been the focus of the

02:21:33 2 you're successful in the CVRA case, in setting aside the 02:23:43 2 Q. Whether --

02:21:55 9 nonprosecution agreement is set aside? 02:24:00 9 your question, that is a possibility that, you know,
02:2158 10 Q. Yes, if you're successful. 0224:02 10 if -- if the case attracts attention and -- and
02:2159 11 A. I haven't really -- that sounds pretty 02:24:05 11 somebody, you know, says, you know, gosh, now that I --
0322:02 12 speculative. I haven't really thought about the 02:24:0912 I -- I -- you know, I moved away to escape Epstein and
02:22:04 13 civil -- the focus of the CVRA case is criminal. I 0224,1013 now it's safe for me to come back, or -- or now I
02:2258 14 haven't thought about, you know, whether, civil claims 02:24:13 14 realize I have a claim, that's always a possibility.
02:22:11 15 could somehow arise out of that. I mean, we are talking 02:24:15 15 I certainly wouldn't want to suggest that,
02:2214 16 about, you know, events that took place long ago. There 0224:17 16 you know, we are ruling that possibility out.
02:2118 17 would be statute of limitations issues, you know. 02:24:19 17 Q. And for the same reason that additional
02:22:20 18 Whether they are viable civil claims at this point has 0224:23 18 witnesses might become available -- known, additional
02:22:24 19 not been something that I have, you know, given much 02:24:27 19 clients might become known, correct?
02:22:25 20 thought to. 022428 20 A. That is a theoretical possibility, yes.
0122:26 21 Q. So is it your testimony then that you have 02:2430 21 Q. In these four cases that you mentioned, the
02:22:28 22 not thought about the question of whether success in the 02:24:34 22 three that were, which you were counsel of record and
02:22:33 23 CVRA case may or result in you obtaining additional 02:24:38 23 one in which you were not, did you meet at any time in

02:24:50 1 A. Yes. 02:27:10 1 filing on December 30th of 2014, was the first time that
02:24:50 2 Q. In all four, you met with the clients? 02:27:16 2 you had ever, yes, ever on behalf of Virginia Roberts or
02:24:52 3 A. In three of the four. 02:27:21 3 any other client, accused Professor Dershowitz or
02:24:53 4 Q. And were those three the three in which you 02:2725 4 Prince Andrew of sexual abuse in a public filing?
02:24:57 5 were counsel of record? 02:27:29 5 A. If you're talking about direct allegation,
02:24:58 6 A. Yes. 02:27:31 6 that's correct.
02:24:59 7 Q. As of December -- 02:27'31 7 Q. Had you ever public -- well, at no other time
02:25:01 8 A. I believe I was counsel of record on all 022239 8 that -- you expected when you filed the pleading on
02:25:03 9 three of those. I would have to double-check. I know I 02:27:41 9 December 30th, 2014, that it would be -- be something of
02:25:05 10 was counsel of record in the federal case. The two of 02:27:45 10 public record that would generate publicity, correct?
0225:08 11 them are state cases, I believe, that it was pro hac in 02:27:48 11 A. Public record, the focus was not generating
02:25:11 12 the state cases. 02:27:51 12 publicity. Of course, when you file an allegation like
02:25:14 13 Q. Okay. I wont ask you the names, but in the 02:27:54 13 that, there certainly would have been -- we would
0225:14 14 four cases, what are the initials of your clients? 02:27:55 14 anticipate there would have been publicity, absolutely.
02:25:19 15 A. Okay. So the -- the -- 0227:58 15 Q. And before December 30th of 2014, to the best
02:25:20 16 Q. Put it this way: How are they identified in 022803 16 of your knowledge, neither you, nor anyone else, had
02:25:22 17 the caption that you filed? 02:28:08 17 told Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations
02:25:23 18 A. Well, also the three that were filed, one 0228:12 18 that he personally had engaged in sexual misconduct?
02:25:26 19 was -- one was the initials S.R. I referred to 02.28:12 19 A. um...
02:25:28 20 Miss S.R. yesterday. That was the Jane Doe case in 0228:19 20 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to that
02:25:32 21 Federal Court in front of Judge Marra. 02:28:20 21 date if that reveals anything that would be
0225:34 22 There were two state claims. I'll -- I'll 022821 22 privileged between something that would have been
02:25:37 23 identify the clients as E.W. and L.M. 0228:24 23 communicated by the client.
02:25:42 24 Q. And then the fourth one? 0228:25 24 MR. SIMPSON: No. These are communications
02:25:44 25 A. The fourth one, I believe -- the initial M. 02:28:27 25 to Professor Dershowitz.

02:25:54 2 wrong about the B. First initial M. 02:2531 2 include attorney/client privileged
02:25:56 3 Q. At the -- okay. At the time that you filed 0228:33 3 communications.
0225:04 4 the joinder motion -- 02:28:36 4 MR. SIMPSON: Let me -- I'll ask my question.
02:26:05 5 A. Yes. 02:28:37 5 BY MR. SIMPSON:
0226:06 6 Q. -- in the federal case, so December 30th of 02:28:38 6 Q. My question is: Did you ever advise
02:26:10 7 2014, you knew that naming Prince Andrew would generate 0228:45 7 Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations that he
02:26:15 8 substantial publicity, correct? 0228:50 8 had engaged, himself, in sexual misconduct with minors?
02:26:18 9 A. I knew it would attract a lot of attention. 0228:56 9 A. Not me personally, no.
02:26:23 10 Yeah, I mean, "substantial" we could debate, but, sure, 02:28:57 10 Q. Are you aware of any e-mail, letter, other
02:26:25 11 I knew that that was going to -- you know, once you 0229:04 11 communication from anybody that went to Professor
0226:28 12 start exposing the extent of this criminal activity, 02:29:09 12 Dershowitz that told Professor Dershowitz that he had
0226:33 13 obviously, there were going to be a lot of people 02:29:12 13 been accused of engaging in misconduct himself?
02:26:36 14 interested, yes. 0229:17 14 A. Well, there -- I mean, I'm aware that there
0226:36 15 Q. And you also knew that naming Professor 0229719 15 was a deposition request in 2009. There was a
0225:41 16 Dershowitz would attract publicity? 0229:22 16 deposition request in 2011. That was accompanied by an
02:26:46 17 A. Well, when you say "naming," one of the 022527 17 exchange of correspondence that said, for example,
0225:49 18 things you've got to understand is the names were 02:29:29 18 numerous witnesses have placed you in the presence of
0226:50 19 already in the case, both Prince Andrew and Alan 02:29:31 19 Jeffrey Epstein and underaged girls. It didn't then go
0225:56 20 Dershowitz. We had pending discovery requests for 02:29:35 20 on to say, and you were committing sexual abuse of them,
0226:59 21 information about both of them. So when you say "naming 0229:38 21 but it said numerous witnesses had -- had done that.
02:27:00 22 them," you know, they were already named in the case. 02:2942 22 And I think a reasonable inference would be
02:27:02 23 Now, would the additional allegations have 02:29:43 23 that, you know, you're verily sure that a witness and
02:2705 24 attracted additional attention? Sure. 02:29:47 24 then that also raises the possibility of -- well, I
02:27:07 25 Q. Mr. Cassell, it's true, is it not, that the

0/34:01 6 A. That sounds about right, yeah. 02:35:45 6 that puts you on notice that you're in -- in --
02:34:03 7 Q. So Mr. Dershowitz did not ignore the letter; 02:35:49 7 in jeopardy of -- of criminal activity,
02:34:04 8 he responded to it, correct? 02:3552 8 particularly when you combine that with the fact
02:34:06 9 A. i think that's right. 02:35,54 9 that there is a duty to report child abuse in
02:34:07 10 Q. And go back to the first letter. 02,35:57 10 many states in this country, including the State
02:34:10 11 A. But, now, if we are -- if we're talking 02:35:57 11 of Florida.
02:34:11 12 about -- yeah, there's that one letter and now there's a 02:35:59 12 And so that if those observations were such
02:34:14 13 response letter, right. 02:36:02 13 that they would give rise to a reasonable
02:34:14 14 Q. My question to you is: Does the statement to 02:36,05 14 inference that sex abuse was -- of children was
02:34:21 15 a person that "we have reason to believe that you have 02:36:08 15 going on and you'd be obligated to report it, as
02:34:26 16 personally observed another person in the presence of 02:36:09 16 I think Mr. Dershowitz conceded yesterday, yes,
02:34:31 17 underage females and we would like to ask you about your 02:36:72 17 you -- I think that puts you on notice that --
02:34:35 18 observations," put the recipient on notice that you, 02:36:14 18 that those kinds of things are being alleged.
02:34:41 19 yourself, are accused of criminal conduct in abusing 02:36:16 19 BY MR. SIMPSON:
02:34:45 20 minors? 02:36:18 20 Q. So, first, the letter itself, the letter from
02:34:46 21 A. Well, it puts you on notice that you're a 02:36:22 21 Mr. Scarola simply says, you were -- you were personally
02:34:49 22 potential, obviously, witness to this and then therefore 02:36:28 22 -- you personally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the
02:34:51 23 you could have potential involvement. 02:36:31 23 presence of underaged females, correct?
02:34,53 24 Let me give you a simple illustration. It'll 02:36:33 24 A. Correct.

02:34:56 1 Q. Well, let me back up. My first question, 02:36:37 1 minor; we have reason to believe you observed abuse of
02,34:57 2 though, if you can answer the question. o2:36:39 2 minors?
02:3418 3 MR. SCAROLA: No. I'm sorry. The witness is 02,38:39 3 A. If those words do not appear there, but come

02:35:06 8 MR. SIMPSON: He -- 02:36:52 8 talking about sexual abuse of children.
0/35:06 9 MR. SCAROLA: So go ahead and complete your 02:36,56 9 And that was what Mr. Dershowitz was going to
02:35:08 10 response. 02:36:59 10 be asked about. And he did not -- he did not take that
02:35:08 11 MR. SIMPSON: Can we have a -- you can give 02:37:02 11 opportunity to try to clear the record; instead, we are,
02:35,09 12 an explanation, but a yes or no with an 02:37:05 12 you know, here today, because among other reasons, he
02:35:10 13 explanation. 02:37:09 13 he -- he wasn't deposed then.
02:35:11 14 MR. SCAROLA: You already got that. Could we 02:37:7214 Q. I want -- I want to comment. I'm just a
02:35:12 15 now have the completion of the response? 02,37:18 15 little bit non -- nonplussed, so I want to come back to
0235:14 16 THE WITNESS: Here's the simple illustration 02:37:21 16 this again.
02:35,16 17 I think makes it pretty clear: If somebody says, 02:37:27 17 A. Well, I'm -- I have to tell you, I'm a little
02:35:17 18 we have observed you in the presence of a kilo of 02:37:23 18 bit nonplussed that somebody would say that letter
02:35:20 19 cocaine, we would like to question you about the 02:37:24 19 doesn't put you on notice that you're potentially
0235:23 20 presence -- about your observations of this, that 02:37:27 20 involved in criminal activity. I mean, come on.

02:35:27 22 or a drug dealer, but it certainly puts you on 02:37:33 22 in criminal activity. We disagree about whether it does
02:35:29 23 notice that you're associated with that criminal 02:37:36 23 that.
02:35:37 24 activity and somebody is going to question you 02:37:37 24 A. Okay. I think it does.

02:37,49 4 you about your observations of a convicted sex offender 02:40:08 4 Now, whether the -- the -- the tentacles of
02:37:52 5 with underage girls, that that's going to be one of the 024610 5 the organization would extend so that they wrapped
02:37:56 6 subjects that's going to be discussed, yes. 02:40:13 6 around Mr. Dershowitz himself, I guess was the subject
02:37:56 7 Q. My question was -- my initial question was: 02:40:16 7 that -- that Mr. Scarola, I am assuming, was hoping to
02:38:01 8 Does -- do the statements in this letter put the reader 02:40:18 8 explore. But Mr. Dershowitz prevented that opportunity.
02:38:05 9 on notice that you, personally, are accused of abusing 02:4622 9 Q. And Mr. Dershowitz, you knew, had been
02:3614 10 minors yourself, not that you have in some knowledge or 02:40:26 10 Mr. Epstein's attorney, correct?
02:38:19 11 evidence that someone else did it, but that you, 02:40:27 11 A. Correct.
02:38:22 12 yourself, did it; is that a way to give fair notice? 02:40:28 12 Q. And you knew, just as we have seen here today
02:38:26 13 A. Well, in fair notice in what context? You 02:4632 13 with multiple assertions of privilege, that he could not
02:38:30 14 know, is he on notice that a lawsuit is going to be 02:40:36 14 testify about anything he learned as an attorney?
02:38:31 15 filed the next day? 02:4637 15 A. He could testify, and the letter itself says,
02:38:32 16 Simply from that piece of -- that letter 02:4640 16 we are not going to ask you about any communications; we
02:3834 17 alone, they are on notice, you know -- I mean, I think 0240:43 17 are going to ask you about observations of sex abuse by
02:3837 18 that puts you on notice that there are serious 0240:47 18 a convicted sex offender, and your personal knowledge of
02:38:41 19 allegations afoot and it would be in your best interest 02:40:55 19 that. That would not have erased in the -- and
02:38:43 20 if you hadn't done anything, to show up, attend a 02:40:52 20 Mr. Scarola's a very good attorney, and I'm sure all of
02:38:46 21 deposition, let all the facts come out so that everybody 02:40:55 21 his questions that we saw the last couple of days would
02:38:48 22 can know them. 02:4658 22 have been very narrowly focused on observations about
02:38:49 23 Q. Would you agree that accusing someone of 02:41:01 23 what this criminal organization was doing.
023654 24 themselves abusing a minor is different than accusing 02:41:05 24 Q. And so to the bottom line is that your view,
023600 25 someone of having knowledge that somebody else did it?

273 275
02:39:03 1 A. Yes. 0241,16 1 put Mr. Dershowitz, Professor Dershowitz, on fair notice
02:3964 2 Q. And to accuse someone of abusing a minor is a 02:4121 2 that he was being accused of being a sex offender
02:39:09 3 serious, serious accusation of criminal conduct, 02:4125 3 himself?
02,3614 4 personal criminal conduct, not just failing to report 02:4126 4 A. We -- we have gone over this. I think it put
02:39:17 5 somebody else, but you, yourself, are abusing people? 02:41:28 5 him on fair notice that there were serious questions
02:39:21 6 A. Oh, yeah. 02:41:31 6 being raised about what he knew about this criminal
02:39:21 7 MR. SCAROLA: Are you suggesting that that's 02:41:35 7 organization, what the potential criminal responsibility
02:39:23 8 not criminal conduct? 02:41:36 8 he had for failure to report sexual abuse of a child, as
02:39:25 9 MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- my question 02A1:39 9 well as other possibilities.
0239:26 10 stands. 02:41:42 10 MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to move to strike as
02:39:26 11 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:41:43 11 nonresponsive.
0239:26 12 Q. What is the answer to that? 02:41A3 12 BY MR. SIMPSON:
02:39:27 13 A. It is a very serious charge, I agree. That's 02:41:44 13 Q. My question is a very narrow one, whether
02:3630 14 why we are all here today. 02:41,47 14 this letter, in your opinion, under oath, fairly put
02:39:30 15 Q. Okay. And -- and if you wanted to put 02,41:53 15 Mr. -- Professor Dershowitz on notice that he himself
02:39:32 16 someone on fair notice that they are accused themselves 02:41:58 16 was accused of abusing minors.
02:39:36 17 of being a sex offender, a criminal who has abused 0242:02 17 A. Again, that's a vague question. I've tried
02:3641 18 children, wouldn't you tell them that? 02:42:04 18 to give the best answer I can. That was certainly a
02:3643 19 A. That's a speculative question because that 02:42:06 19 potential area of questioning. I think that puts him on
02:39:46 20 letter was designed to try to collect information about 02:42:09 20 notice that it would have been in his best interest to
02:39:48 21 an international sex trafficking organization. And so 0242:12 21 appear to answer those questions.
02:39:52 22 as to -- you know, I'm not going to speculate as to why 02:42:14 22 MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to object to the
02:3655 23 Mr. Scarola wrote it that way. But my sense, based on 02:42:16 23 answer again as nonresponsive.
02:3658 24 the public record is, that he was trying to get as much 02A2:16 24 BY MR. SIMPSON:
024601 25 information as he could about what Jeffrey Epstein and 02A2.18 25 Q. Its a really simple question.

02:42:20 1 Does that letter put Mr. Dershowitz on fair 02:44:17 1 having abused minors? Can you answer that: Yes or no?
02:42:23 2 notice that he's accused of being a sex offender 02:4421 2 A. No. I think a yes-or-no answer would be
02:42:26 3 himself? 02:44:24 3 misleading, given the context of this case.
02:42:27 4 MR. SCAROLA: Objection. Repetitious. To 02:4427 4 Q. You referred in your earlier testimony to -
024228 5 the extent that you can improve upon the answer, 02:44A4 5 strike that for a moment.
02:42:32 6 you can improve upon the answer. If you cant, 0244,46 6 You referred in your earlier testimony to an
02:42:35 7 all you need to do is say that. 02:45:04 7 article that appeared today regarding
02:42:37 8 THE WITNESS: I -- and I'll try to -- 02:45:09 8 Professor Dershowitz's deposition testimony, correct?
02:4238 9 obviously, I want to be responsive -- 0245:11 9 A. I don't think so.
02:42:38 10 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:4513 10 Q. Okay. Are you aware that -- well, perhaps it
02:42:38 11 Q. Let -- let me ask -- 02:45:17 11 was Miss McCawley who referred to it.
02:4240 12 A. -- to your question. 0245;19 12 Do you recall there being a reference this
02:42:40 13 Q. I'll ask you a different question. 02:45:21 13 morning to an article being published about
02:42:41 14 A. I don't think that's a yes or no question 02:45:24 14 Professor Dershowitz's testimony?
02:42:43 15 because of -- of you're including vague terms like fair 024626 15 MS. McCAWLEY: Oh, I'm sorry. It was me. I
02:42:46 16 notice and -- and those sorts of things. So -- but go 02:45:28 16 objected to the extent -- only to the extent it
02:42:49 17 ahead and ask your questions and I'll -- I mean, go 02:45:30 17 revealed something public that had been stated in
02:42:55 18 ahead. 02'45,33 18 public.
02:42:55 19 Q. You're a former federal judge? 0245:33 19 BY MR. SIMPSON:
0242:55 20 A. Right. 02:45,34 20 Q. Okay. And I -- you recall that?
02:42:56 21 Q. A former Supreme Court law -- law clerk? 02:4636 21 A. Yeah, I recall the objection. I think
02:42:58 22 A. Yes. 0245:37 22 there's an article that came out yesterday or a
02:42:59 23 Q. Professor at a law school? 02:45:39 23 communication. I -- I -- you know, I can't remember

02:43:09 1 letter, in your opinion, does the language itself put 02:45:47 1 other way from the -- from the -- you know, I became
024318 2 the recipient on notice that the recipient is accused of 02:45:51 2 aware that there was a statement that the -- what's the
02:43:23 3 abusing minors himself? 02:4655 3 name of the outfit? It's the Business Investor --
0243:27 4 A. It puts him on notice that that is going to 02:45:57 4 MR. SCAROLA: Daily Business Review.
02:43:29 5 be a potential subject of inquiry at the -- at the -- 02:45:58 5 THE WITNESS: Daily Business Review that was

02:43:37 8 the -- the person on notice; that's your reading? 02:46:08 8 false.

02:43:42 10 mouth. You're -- you're trying to ask, you know, a 0246:09 10 I apologize.
02:43:44 11 question that on the one hand, you're suggesting is 02:46.10 11 THE WITNESS: Yeah. And, I'm sorry, just for
02:43:47 12 narrow, and on the other hand is broad. It -- I mean, 0246.1212 the name of that, so...
02:43:50 13 this is probably the simplest way to answer that 0246:12 13 BY MR. SIMPSON:
02:43:50 14 question. 02:4613 14 Q. And you -- in your earlier testimony, you
02.43:51 15 If I had gotten that letter, I would have 02'46.14 15 referred to it -- you didn't recall the name, but you
02:43:52 16 said, schedule the deposition in the next 24 hours, and 02:46,17 16 referred to it as a reputable --
02:43:55 17 come on down here now, and I will be available for a 02:46:18 17 A. That's right.
02:43:58 18 week. That's what I would have said if I had gotten 024619 18 Q. -- publication?
0244:01 19 that letter. 02:4621 19 A. That's right. That's the one we are talking
0244:02 20 MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike as 02:4621 20 about, right.
02:44:03 21 nonresponsive. 024621 21 Q. Right. And in that article it states:

02:44:06 23 Q. Is it your testimony you can't answer yes or 0246:32 23 "later issued a statement on Boies's behalf
02:44,09 24 no whether that letter, on its face, puts the recipient 02:46:35 24 saying, because the discussions that Mr. Boies

02:46:43 2 least at this time, describe what was actually 02:48:15 2 MR. SIMPSON: No. I just want "-
02:46:46 3 said. However, Mr. Boies does state that 0248:15 3 MS. McCAWLEY: We disagree with
02:46:50 4 Mr. Dershowitz's description of what was said is 02:4816 4 your characterization of that as a waiver. It
02:46:54 5 not true." 02:48:19 5 was a statement that was issued in order to stop
02:46:55 6 A. That's the one. 0248:22 6 the waivers that Mr. Dershowitz was trying to
02:46:55 7 Q. You read that? 02:48:22 7 engage in, and we -- we don't agree that's a
02:46:56 8 A. Yeah. I -- I learned of it -- yeah, I don't 02:48:25 8 waiver and we will not allow any testimony
02:46:58 9 remember whether I read or how I got it, but yeah, 02:48:27 9 regarding those communications.
02:47:00 10 that's the one. 02:48:28 10 MR. SIMPSON: Okay. I disagree with the
02:47:00 11 Q. In light of that statement by Mr. Boies, 02:48:31 11 position and the characterization, but I just
02:47:03 12 would you agree that any privilege has been waived? 02:48:33 12 wanted to clarify on the record, I didn't have to
02:47,06 13 A. i would not. 02:4815 13 ask those questions again.
02:47:06 14 Q. So -- 02:48:35 14 MR. SCAROLA: Sure.
02:47:07 15 A. That's -- that's a newspaper article. 0248:38 15 MS. McCAWLEY: I understand.
02.47:08 16 Q. Its a pub -- it's a quote. Let me clarify. 02:4838 16 MR. SIMPSON: And, obviously, our position is
0247:12 17 That's a statement -- quoting a statement issued by 02:48:39 17 that if it hadn't already been -- if it hadn't
0247:16 18 Ms. McCawley and quoting Mr. Boies as saying, 02:48:41 18 already been waived -- either it wasn't
02:47:20 19 Mr. Dershowitz's description of what was said is not 02:4043 19 privileged or hadn't been waived, its now
02:47:23 20 true, so that's a public statement by Mr. Boles saying 02:4847 20 waived.
02:4726 21 that Mr. Dershowitz's testimony is not true; is that a 02:4047 21 THE WITNESS: And my -- just '-
0247:29 22 waiver in your view? 0248750 22 MR. SIMPSON: I don't have a question.
02:47:30 23 A. No. And that would require -- I'm with -- 02:48:51 23 THE WITNESS: I know, but I -- but I think
02:47:32 24 I'm just putting you on notice, talking about notice, if 0248:52 24 now in light of, since the record has these

02:47:39 1 answer as to why that's not a waiver. Off the top of my 02:48:57 1 the record, which is: It doesn't seem to me that
02:47:41 2 head, I can start talking about that. 0248:58 2 an attorney can inject into a deposition

024746 6 Q. But I really wanted to clarify -- and what I 02:49:05 6 that's --
0247:49 7 wanted to clarify was -- 02:49:08 7 MR. SIMPSON: There's no question pending. I
02:47:49 8 A. I do not -- let me just be clear, so the 02:49:10 8 move to strike the comments.
0247,51 9 record is clear: I absolutely do not believe that's a 02:49:12 9 THE WITNESS: Right. I just didn't want your

0247:55 11 know time is drawing short -- 0249:15 11 answer.

02:50:35 17 blackmail information"? 02:53:13 17 allegations did generate publicity, certainly.
02:5026 18 A. Okay. Let me just double-check. 025315 18 Q. Yes. The allegations in your joinder motion
02:50:41 19 Once the criminal organization had put the 02:53:18 19 that Prince Andrew and Professor Dershowitz had abused

0250:58 25 these -- these young girls, at that point, they had 0253:38 25 ABC News; isn't that true?

02:51:01 I information that they could use to blackmail those 02:53:39 1 A. That -- within days of -- the chronology is
02:51:02 2 people and -- and then get favors in exchange. 02:53:43 2 important here: The allegations were filed in this
02:51:05 3 And that's Epstein at the head of the o2:53:45 3 pleading on December 30th. Several days after that,
0251:08 4 organization would be the one who would benefit most 02:53:48 4 Mr. Dershowitz then took to the airwaves to denounce,
0251:11 5 directly from the black -- the blackmail information. 02:5353 5 not only Brad and me, but -- but particularly of concern
02:51:12 6 Q. And by "blackmail information," do you mean 02:5256 6 to me was Virginia Roberts, this victim of sex
D2:5117 7 that Mr. Epstein then had information that he could 02:5358 7 trafficking.
02:5119 8 threaten to disclose if the other person didn't do what 02:53:59 8 And, at that point, as one of -- as one of
02:5124 9 Epstein asked them to do? 0254:01 9 her attorneys, I was looking for a way to respond to
0251:24 10 A. Precisely. 02:54:05 10 that media assault on her by Mr. Dershowitz.
0251:26 11 Q. As of December 30th, 2014, if Miss Roberts 02:54,09 11 MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike as
02:51:32 12 had access to publicity, she had exactly the same 02:54:09 12 nonresponsive.
02:5135 13 ability to blackmail people; isn't that true? 02:54:09 13 BY MR. SIMPSON:
0251:38 14 A. Absolutely not. A billionaire has far more 02:5415 14 Q. Did -- within 24 hours of this pleading being
0251:43 15 resources than a victim of child sex abuse, particularly 02:54:22 15 filed, there was publicity about the allegations against
02:51746 16 one that has been forced into hiding in Australia to 02:54:27 16 Prince Andrew and Mr. Dershowitz -- Professor
02:51:49 17 escape the criminal organization. 02:54:31 17 Dershowitz; isn't that correct?
02:51,51 18 So for you to suggest that Virginia Roberts 02:54,32 18 A. I don't know the exact time frame, but
02:51,52 19 had the same ability to blackmail somebody as Jeffrey 02,54:34 19 that -- you know, roughly that time frame sounds about
02:5156 20 Epstein is, I think, preposterous. 02:5426 20 right.
025200 21 Q. As of -- Miss -- Miss Roberts had the same 02:54:36 21 Q. If Mr. -- if Professor Dershowitz had never
02:52:03 22 ability as Jeffrey Epstein to reveal publicly the names 0254:39 22 said anything, wouldn't you expect that these
02:52:12 23 of the people who she says sexually abused her, as did 02:54:42 23 allegations as to Prince Andrew, in particular, and
02:52:17 24 Mr. Epstein; isn't that true? 02:54:47 24 Professor Dershowitz would get substantial publicity?
0252:19 25 A. You're talking about physical ability to 02:54:50 25 A. There was -- there was --

02:54:51 I MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. To the extent the 02:56:15 1 Prince Andrew had sexually abused Virginia Roberts,
0254:53 2 question calls for speculation, I object. 02:56:19 2 correct?
52:54:55 3 MR. SIMPSON: No. I'm asking for his state 02:56:19 3 A. That was one of the allegations in here,
5254:57 4 of mind when he filed this document. 02:56:21 4 sure.
02:54:59 5 THE WITNESS: There's no doubt that -- 02:56:21 5 Q. And the allegations that Professor Dershowitz
02:54:59 6 MR. SCAROLA: So the question is: At the 02:56:25 6 had sexually abused Virginia Roberts, correct?
0255:01 7 time of the filing -- 0256:31 7 A. That's right. It was in a -- what we were --
02:55:02 8 MR. SIMPSON: Please -- please don't coach 0256:32 8 what we were starting to document and allege here was
02:55:03 9 the witness. 02:56:35 9 that terrible things that Epstein's criminal
02:55:03 10 MR. SCAROLA: No, I'm not coaching him. I 02:56:39 10 organization had done.
02:55:05 11 just want to understand the question. You're 0215639 11 Q. Let me refer you to page 6 --
0255:06 12 asking what his state of mind was at the time of 02:56:42 12 A. Okay.
02:55:09 13 filing? 02:56:42 13 Q. -- of your filing. It's the first full
02:55:09 14 MR. SIMPSON: Did he -- did he anticipate -- 02:56:48 14 paragraph.
02:55:09 15 MR. SCAROLA: Because the other question was: 02:5648 15 A. Yep.
02:55:11 16 What do you -- what's your position today. 02:56:49 16 Q. I'm going to read it. "Epstein also
02:55:13 17 MR. SIMPSON: Mr. Scarola, really. 02:56,51 17 trafficked Jane Doe Number 3 for sexual purposes to many
02:55:14 18 MR. SCAROLA: That's -- that's a different 02;56:56 18 other powerful men."
02:55:15 19 question. So I just want to know which one 02:56:57 19 A. Okay.
02:55:17 20 you're asking. 0256:57 20 Q. "Including numerous prominent American
02:55:18 21 Do you want to know his state of mind then, 02:57:00 21 politicians, powerful business executives, foreign
02:55:21 22 or his state of mind today? 02:57:05 22 presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world
02:55:23 23 MR. SIMPSON: I will take that as an 02:57:10 23 leaders. Jane -- Epstein required Jane Doe Number 3 to
02:55:25 24 objection to the form of the question. 0257:15 24 describe the events that she had with these men so that
02:55:25 25 02:5718 25 he could potentially blackmail them."

02:5525 1 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:57:20 1 Did I read that correctly?
02:5527 2 Q. As of -- 02:57:21 2 A. You did.
02:55:27 3 MR. SCAROLA: It's a request for a 02;57:22 3 Q. With respect to blackmail, the ability to
025528 4 clarification of an ambiguous question. 02:57:28 4 blackmail, is that the same potential we talked about a
02:55:33 5 MR. SIMPSON: It's coaching the witness. 02:57:30 5 moment ago in your testimony?
02:55:33 6 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:57:32 6 A. Sure.
0255:34 7 Q. As of -- 02:57:32 7 Q. And you're referring there to --
025634 8 A. Yeah, I don't need any coaching. I mean... 02:57:34 8 A. Roughly, yeah. I mean, if there's something
02155:35 9 Q. Let me ask the question. 02:57:35 9 that you want clarified, go ahead and clarify it.
0255:36 10 As of December 30th -- that's true -- as 025737 10 Q. I just -- I just wanted to make sure I
02:55:39 11 of -- 02:57:39 11 understand correctly that when you refer that -- to
02:55:39 12 A. Right -- 02:57:42 12 Epstein requiring Virginia Roberts to describe these
02:55:39 13 Q. -- we agree that's coaching. 0257:44 13 events so that he could potentially blackmail them, what
02:55:39 14 A. -- but that wasn't coaching. That wasn't 025748 14 you had in mind was, Epstein wanted to know what
02:55:41 15 coaching, so the suggestion that it's coaching is -- is 0257:52 15 Virginia Roberts did with these men so that he had the
02:55:43 16 not fair. 02:57:55 16 ability to threaten to disclose it if they didn't do
02:55:43 17 Q. Okay. We disagree. 0257:58 17 what he wanted them to do?
02:55:46 18 As of December 30th, 2014, did you anticipate 02:57:59 18 A. That was -- that was part of it, yes.
0255:52 19 that naming Prince Andrew in a public filing as having 02:5601 19 Q. And isn't it true you could have
02:55:58 20 abused Virginia Roberts would generate substantial 02:5804 20 accomplished -- in terms of furthering Virginia
02:56:02 21 publicity? 02:58:07 21 Roberts's legal interests, you could have accomplished
02:5603 22 A. "Substantial" is a debatable word, but 02:58:10 22 exactly the same thing by saying Epstein also
02:56:06 23 certainly, it's going to generate publicity, yes. 02:5814 23 trafficked -- trafficked Jane Doe Number 3 for sexual
02:56:10 24 Publicity about the allegations. 02:5818 24 purposes to other well-known men, period?
02:5612 25 Q. Yes. And -- and the allegations are that 0258:24 25 A. No, I don't think so.

0268:26 1 Q. Okay. You felt that it furthered her legal 0104:31 1 break. I appreciate that.
02:58:30 2 interests to specify American politicians, powerful 03:04:32 2 Q. Okay.
02:58:34 3 business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known 03:04:32 3 MR. SCAROLA: Could you just read back the
02:58:38 4 prime minister and other world leaders; that was your -- 0104:34 4 last question for me? I just want to orient
0268:42 5 you -- you believe that furthered her legal interest? 03:04:37 5 myself as to where we are. Thank you.
02:58:43 6 A. Yes. 0104:37 6 (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read
0258:43 7 Q. Did you also anticipate that that would 03:05:33 7 by the reporter.)
02:58:47 8 titillate the Press, so to speak, that there would be a 0305:33 8 MR. SCAROLA: Yeah, I didn't I think the
02:58:49 9 lot of speculation on who these people are? 03:05:34 9 answer was --
02:58:52 10 A. That wasn't the -- that wasn't the focus 03:05:34 10 THE WITNESS: I guess I was mid-sentence, so
02:58:54 11 of the -- those comments, no. 03:05:36 11 think I will just stick with the same word,
0268,55 12 Q. You said it wasn't the focus. Did you 03:05:38 12 preposterous. And one -- one thing that occurred
02:58:57 13 realize it would happen? 03:0639 13 to me during the break, in the context of this
02,5868 14 A. Sure. I mean, this was a case that had 03:05:42 14 case, is that there had been allegations that
026962 15 been already -- this litigation had been going on at 03:05:44 15 Epstein was part of the -- the sex trafficking
02,59:02 16 that point for seven years and lots of people were 0105:47 16 organization, had video cameras mounted
02;59:04 17 following it. This is -- this case is one of the most 01064917 throughout many of his -- his mansions. And so,
02,5967 18 egregious examples of a violation of Crime Victims' 03,05:52 18 whereas a young woman could say, or a young girl
02:59:11 19 Rights in the history of this country. 03:05:55 19 could say, look, I was a victim of sex abuse,
02:59:13 20 And so against that context, yes, there were 03:05:58 20 people would attack her; people wouldn't believe
02:59:14 21 going to be people interested in every word that was 03:06:00 21 her, that unless she had, you know, corroborating
02:59:16 22 going into this pleading. Whether we had gone more 03:06:02 22 evidence, people would say, well, look, it didn't
0269:19 23 broadly or more narrowly than what we did, people were 03:0665 23 happen.
0269:23 24 going to be interested in this. 03,06:05 24 And so Epstein had managed to collect
02:59:23 25 Q. And as of December 30th of 2014, Miss Roberts 0106:08 25 apparently a lot of videotapes and other kinds of

02:59:31 1 had the same ability to disclose who these individuals 0306:11 1 information that would have been -- given him the
02:59i34 2 were publicly, as did Jeffrey Epstein, correct, because 0106:14 2 ability to make the blackmail kinds of charges
02:5918 3 she had personal knowledge of who they were? 03,06:15 3 that the girls that he was trafficking would --
02.59:40 4 A. She had the ability to speak the words, but, 03:06:18 4 would not have had the ability to do.
02:5642 5 again, I think its preposterous to say that a victim of 03:06:18 5 BY MR. SIMPSON:
02:59:45 6 sex trafficking has the same power as the sex trafficker 036620 6 Q. Mr. Cassell, didn't you testify yesterday
025948 7 to disclose information. 0106:22 7 that any videotapes from Mr. Epstein's house had been
02:59:51 8 For example, Virginia Roberts could be 03:0627 8 destroyed?
02:5962 9 attacked, and I think as we were talking about 0106:28 9 A. I -- when I used the word "destroyed," I
02:59:54 10 yesterday, we have seen evidence of the kind of attack 03:06:30 10 probably should have been more precise. They had been
0259,57 11 that powerful people can mount against the victims of 03:06:32 11 concealed from law enforcement, is what I meant. That
03:00:01 12 sex trafficking. So to say that the young women in sex 0106:35 12 when Palm Beach Police Department went up to the Epstein
03:00:04 13 trafficking schemes have the same power as their 0106:37 13 mansion, they found surveillance cameras and other
03:00:07 14 traffickers to do this -- I'm sorry. I'm going to have 0106,41 14 cameras. I can't remember exactly where the cameras
03:00:11 15 to take a break. 03:06:44 15 were, but they found surveillance cameras, and when they
03:00:12 16 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the video 0366,46 16 looked for the tapes associated with those cameras, I
03:00:14 17 record, 11:32 a.m. 03:06:50 17 used the word "destroyed"; and as I say, I probably
03:04:14 18 (Thereupon, a recess was taken.) 03:06:50 18 should have said they were missing. And so they were
03:04:14 19 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video 03:06:52 19 never able to locate those -- those missing videotapes.
03:0420 20 record, 11:36 a.m. 03:06:55 20 Q. So as of December 30th of 2014, to your
03:0424 21 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03;07,01 21 knowledge, there were no videotapes available?
010427 22 Q. Had you finished your answer, Mr. Cassell? 03:07:03 22 A. There were no videotapes available to law
03:0428 23 A. I think I had. 03:07:06 23 enforcement or to Brad and his pro bono crime victim
0364,28 24 Q. Okay. 03:07:09 24 attorneys to help document our case. We were trying to

030727 6 A. I -- I'm sorry. I shouldn't say "destroyed." 03:09:45 6 Dershowitz and Prince Andrew?
03:07:28 7 They have been able to conceal would probably be a more 03:09A6 7 A. That they were premature.
03:07:30 8 accurate term, the -- the evidence that we are trying to 03:09:48 8 Q. That's your understanding of his order?

03:07:33 11 A. Yeah. 03:09:54 11 A. And I -- maybe I should -- I see some
0107:36 12 Q. -- in the question and answer, your answer to 03:0958 12 skepticism there, so let me explain why I think those
03:07:38 13 my question a couple of questions ago, you talked about 03:10:00 13 allegations -
0107:42 14 whether Mr. Epstein and Virginia Roberts would have the 03:10:01 14 Q. Yeah. Well, we can pull --
03:07:46 15 same or equal ability to disclose -- 03:10:01 15 A. -- are appropriate.
03'07:49 16 A. Right. 03:10:01 16 Q. -- we will pull out the order itself --
03,07:49 17 Q. -- what these prominent politicians, 03:10:01 17 A. Sure.
03:07:53 18 et cetera, had done, correct? 03:10:05 18 Q. -- at the appropriate time, but first, your
03:07:54 19 A. Correct. 03:10:05 19 understanding is that the judge didn't find that those
03:0755 20 Q. Without attempting to make any comparison, 03:10:09 20 allegations, at the time they were made, were so
03:07:50 21 you would agree, would you not, that as of December 03:10:13 21 irrelevant to the case, that they should be stricken
03:08:01 22 30th, 2014, Miss Roberts had the ability to name the 03:10:15 22 from the public record?
0308:07 23 names of the people who are referenced in this document? 031017 23 A. In that pleading at that time, remember, we
03:08:10 24 A. Physical ability, yes. 03:10:20 24 had in our -- our brief -- let me explain the — the
03:0811 25 Q. And -- well, let me ask this: You say a 03:10:24 25 nine reasons why we thought that those allegations were
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400
297 299
03:08:17 1 well-known prime minister. Is that Prime Minister 03:10:27 1 relevant to the case, since I think your question calls
53:08:22 2 Barak? 03:10:28 2 for that.
03:08:22 3 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm gonna instruct you not to 0319:29 3 Q. Are those the nine reasons you gave
03:08:25 4 reveal any attorney/client communications you had 03:10:31 4 yesterday?
03:08:26 5 with Virginia Roberts on the specifics of her 03:10:31 5 A. No, I didn't have a chance to.
03:08:29 6 counsel to you about these individuals. 0310:32 6 Q. Are they the nine reasons that are set forth
03:08:31 7 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03:10:34 7 in your -- in your brief?
03:08:32 8 Q. Is one of the other -- one of the powerful 03:10:35 8 A. They are. Those are the nine reasons that
03,08:34 9 business executives, Les Wexner? 03:10:37 9 are set forth in the brief.
03:0817 10 MS. McCAWLEY: Again, same instruction. 03:10:38 10 Q. Okay. And -- and Judge Marra had that brief
03:08:40 11 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03:10:41 11 in front of him when he held that, these allegations
03:08:41 12 Q. Okay. Now, you mentioned yesterday -- well, 03:10:45 12 were so not relevant to the issues before the court,
03:0640 13 a moment ago, you testified that these -- in your view, 03:10:48 13 that they would be stricken and not part of the public
03:08:51 14 these allegations about other powerful men furthered 03:10:52 14 record?
03:08:58 15 Miss Roberts' legal position in the case, correct? 0310:52 15 A. At that time, in that particular pleading --
03119:02 16 A. Yes. 03:10:55 16 I think you're mischaracterizing Judge Marra's ruling in
0309:02 17 Q. And it's also your position, I assume, that 03:1100 17 its entirety. He specifically said that the allegations
030910 18 the allegations regarding Professor Dershowitz and 03:11:01 18 could be reasserted, if they were relevant to issues
03:09:14 19 Prince Andrew furthered Miss Roberts' legal position; is 03:11:04 19 that are -- that were coming up. And so, in following
03:09:21 20 that right? 0371107 20 that ruling, we went to the U.S. Attorney's Office,
030921 21 A. Absolutely. 03:11:10 21 propounded discovery requests and said, look, we believe

03:11:20 1 And rather than say, hey, we don't have any 011141 1 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of
0311:22 2 such documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office gave us the 0113:45 2 Florida to represent victims, correct?
03:11:26 3 response indicating, to our view, that there were such 011148 3 A. Yes. Through the -- through the NPA, yeah,
D3:11:27 4 documents, and as you know, since you're one of 03:1151 4 there was an apparatus that led to his selection.
03:11:29 5 Mr. Dershowitz's attorneys, we have drafted a pleading 0313:54 5 Q. And does that answer reflect holding the U.S.
03:11:32 6 now to try and collect that information, that law 03:14:01 6 Attorney for the Southern District of Florida in that
0111:36 7 enforce -- federal law enforcement agencies have 031403 7 office in high regard?
031 1:39 8 collected, and -- and to figure out the appropriate way 0114:04 8 A. Sure.
0111:42 9 to litigate that so that we can get that information and 0314:05 9 Q. Do you contend that at the time the United
031 1:44 10 move forward with the case. 0314:11 10 States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida
0111:46 11 That's just one example of -- of how the 031414 11 negotiated the NPA, they knew that Professor Dershowitz,
03:11:49 12 allegations, if they were premature at that point, are 03:1420 12 himself, had been involved in abuse of minors?
03:11:53 13 no longer going to be premature as the case moves along. 03:14:25 13 A. I don't know exactly what information they
03:11:57 14 Q. Is it or is it not your understanding that 03:14:27 14 had. I do know that we have been propounding discovery
0112:01 15 Judge Marra ruled that the allegations in this pleading 03:14:30 15 requests on all of these subjects, including
03:12:08 16 in front of you were so irrelevant to the pleading in 03:14:32 16 Professor Dershowitz's involvement, when the U.S.
0312:14 17 which they were stated, that they should be stricken 03:14:35 17 Attorney knew. They are asserting privilege over that.
011217 18 from the public record? 03:14:37 18 I would wish they would waive the privilege or at least
03:12:18 19 A. In that particular pleading at that 031439 19 provide the information to pro bono crime victims'
03:1220 20 particular time, that's right. 03:14:43 20 attorneys that they have, so we can get to the bottom of
03:12:21 21 Q. Does that cause you to reassess, in any way, 03:14:45 21 this.
03:12:24 22 having filed this document? 03:14:45 22 But there have been, you know, a nonstop
03:12:25 23 A. Well, I think certainly as a tactical matter, 03:14:47 23 series of assertions of privilege and other barriers
0112:28 24 we should have reserved the -- the allegations for -- 0314:49 24 interposed against us in this case, and I think
03:1231 25 for another motion. I -- I think that's -- you know,
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
031453 25 inappropriately so, and -- and we have been arguing that

03:12:34 1 certainly, with the -- you're -- now, we are now sort of 03:14:55 1 now for a number of years.
03:12:38 2 speculating, would we have done something different if 0314:56 2 Q. Would you agree with me that if the United
03:12:39 3 we knew that? And the answer to that is, sure, we would 03:15:00 3 States Attorney's Office had been aware that Professor
031241 4 have tried to do something that Judge Marra thought was 03:15:04 4 Dershowitz had engaged in sexual misconduct with minors,
0312:44 5 the appropriate way to handle it, so... 03:15:07 5 or himself had observed Mr. Epstein do so, that it would
03:12:46 6 Q. And Judge Marra also reminded counsel of 03:1512 6 have been improper and unethical for them to let Mr. --
0312:49 7 their Rule 11 obligations; didn't he? 03:15:17 7 Professor Dershowitz negotiate the terms of the NPA with
0312:51 8 A. That's right. Yeah. 03:1519 8 them?
011252 9 Q. And did it cause you to question, not 031519 9 A. If they had direct personal knowledge of
03;12:57 10 tactics, but whether you were acting properly in filing 03:1521 10 that, sure. I mean, the -- the -- but the realities are
03:13:00 11 this? 03:1123 11 a little bit more complicated in that Professor
03:13:00 12 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I -- 03:1126 12 Dershowitz, over the last couple of days as
03:13:02 13 MR. SIMPSON: I'm just asking if it caused 0315:27 13 frequently -- has frequently used the word "continuum,"
03:13:03 14 him to reassess. 03:15:29 14 and so if they were certain of that, it absolutely would
03:13:04 15 MR. SCAROLA: I understand what you're 031131 15 have -- would have been unethical.
03:13:05 16 asking, and you're asking him about his mental 011533 16 The question is: Well, what if they had a
03:13:07 17 processes in connection with pending litigation. 03:1135 17 suspicion or what if -- you know, a reasonable suspicion
03:1112 18 That's work product. I instruct you not to 0315:36 18 or a possible suspicion. Those are the kinds of
031113 19 answer that question. 0115:39 19 dimensions that you've got to, you know, take into
031314 20 BY MR. SIMPSON: 011142 20 account in the real world about, you know, what they .-
0113:15 21 Q. All right. You testified yesterday that one 03:15,44 21 what they would have done.
03:13:19 22 reason that you found the filing of the complaint on 03:15:50 22 I mean, it seems pretty clear, for example,
0313:27 23 behalf of Jane Doe 102, who is Virginia Roberts, by 031152 23 that at some point, you know, later on, they got a black
03:13:34 24 the -- Bob )osefsberg and -- and why that was 03:15,55 24 book in which Professor Dershowitz's name had been
03:13:37 25 significant was that Bob )osefsberg had been selected by 03:15:58 25 circled. Now, what they did with that information, I --

03:18:00 1 I don't know. 0317:59 1 certainly believe i have a good-faith basis, along with
0316:00 2 Q. And what they did with the fact that Courtney 03:18:02 2 my co-counsel, to explore that subject, and try to see
0316:04 3 Love and Donald Trump were circled, you don't know also, 03:18:04 3 how someone who is fifth in line to the British Throne

03:16:06 5 A. That's right. Fair point. 03:1809 5 he has to influence a -- a -- a disposition in this --
0116:07 6 Q. But somehow it's suspicious as to 03:18:15 6 in the Crime Victims' Rights Act case that it would have
03:16:10 7 Mr. Dershowitz, but not as to anyone else? 03:1019 7 been favorable to one of his friends and potentially
03:16:12 8 MR. SCAROLA: Objection. Argumentative. 03:18:23 8 favorable to himself.
03:16:12 9 THE WITNESS: And I'm -- I'm glad to argue on 03:18:23 9 Q. And -- and you have that view,
03:16:14 10 that point, let me, because they -- 03:18:25 10 notwithstanding that the government had represented they
03:16:14 11 MR. SIMPSON: I'll withdraw the question. 03:18:27 11 have no record of that?
03:16:15 12 THE WITNESS: All right. Because I would 03:18:30 12 A. They didn't -- no, no, no, no. Let's not "...
011616 13 have a -- 03:18:31 13 not -- let's not slip and try to get me to admit
03:16:16 14 MR. SIMPSON: Let -- 031634 14 something that is not what the record reflects. The
0316:17 15 THE WITNESS: -- a substantial argument on 03:18:36 15 government said they did not have documents. They did
03:16:18 16 that. 03:18:38 16 not say that they didn't have any information along

03:16:20 18 question. 031041 18 To the contrary: They asserted a whole
03:16:20 19 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03:18:43 19 series of privileges every time we tried to get
031028 20 Q. With respect, again, to the -- 0318:47 20 information along these lines. So the fact that they

03:16:40 1 motion, Exhibit 2, you knew that the United States 031900 1 something along these lines had never happened and, to
03:16:44 2 Attorney's Office had denied having any contact -- any 0119:03 2 the contrary, we were faced with assertions of privilege
03:16:48 3 documents reflecting any contact with Prince Andrew; 03:19:07 3 over roughly, if i remember correctly, about 10,000
0316:51 4 isn't that true? 0319:08 4 pages of documents where a whole host of privileges were
03:1601 5 A. They had -- there were -- there were various 03:19:11 5 being asserted.
03:16:56 6 discovery requests that had been propounded, and I think 031912 6 Q. Do you think it's credible that the United
03:1669 7 with regard to one, they had denied, and my recollection 03,19:16 7 States Attorney's Office would be discussing an NPA with
03:17:01 8 is with regard to another, where there had been an 0319:20 8 a member of the British Royal Family?
03:17:04 9 assertion of privilege. 0319:22 9 A. Not directly, but there certainly are
03:17:07 10 Q. Is it not true, that before December 30th, 03:19:24 10 possibilities of surrogates. I -- my -- somebody who is
03:17:09 11 2014, in response to a request asking the government: 0119:27 11 that powerful certainly wouldn't go out at it directly.
03:1715 12 Are there any documents reflecting contact with -- by 03:1929 12 What they would probably do is try to find the best
03:17:20 13 Prince Andrew regarding the NPA, the government 03:19:32 13 lawyers they could around the United States and -- and,
03:1724 14 represented, there were none? 03:19:33 14 you know, and some of the, you know, big-named lawyers
03:17:26 15 A. That -- with regard to the -- you're talking 03:1036 15 and try to bring them in there to -- to work a deal.
03:17:30 16 about RFPs, request for production of documents, I 0319:38 16 That's, I think, how, you know, we're -- you're
0317:32 17 believe that's -- I believe that's correct. 03:19:42 17 asking -- your question is asking for speculation and
03:17:33 18 Q. And on December 30th, 2014, knowing that, you 0119:42 18 I'm saying that -- that based on, how would you
0317:38 19 named Prince Andrew in this motion, correct? 0319:46 19 influence a deal in an American criminal justice system?
03:1740 20 A. Correct. 03:19:49 20 You go try to get the best defense lawyers you could and
0317:41 21 Q. And is it your testimony that you believe 03:19:52 21 see -- you know -- you know, figure out which political
0117:4622 that Prince Andrew somehow attempted to influence the 0119:54 22 party was in power; and try to get people who are

0317:56 24 Mr. Epstein? 0319:58 24 that.

033723 15 Other than Virginia Roberts's own testimony, 033931 15 Roberts coming to the house, correct?
0137:26 16 this is the only evidence that you cited to the court to 03:39:02 16 A. Lines 18 to 20 do not refer to Virginia

03:37:47 3 do agree with me that what was cited to the court for 03:39:37 3 little fuzzy here. When Mr. Dershowitz was visiting,
03:37:50 4 the proposition that they were together, in this 033340 4 uh-huh, could be an affirmative answer read in context
03:37:52 5 sentence, doesn't support that proposition? 013345 5 to saying, I don't recall about Prince Andrew, but I do
033734 6 A. I will agree with you that there appears to 03:39:47 6 recall Virginia Roberts being there. And I think when
03:37:56 7 be a miscitation of the line number -- of the lines 18 0339:49 7 we unpack the entirety of the deposition, which we don't
0138:01 8 through 20. 0339:52 8 have time right now, that the context that I'm
03:38:02 9 Now, you're saying that there is not 03:39:54 9 suggesting now would be accurate. So I am not prepared
03:3304 10 information outside of 8 -- lines 18 through 20 to 03:39:57 10 to say, as I sit here right now, that those were the

0338:11 12 much longer answer. 03:4301 12 Perhaps those are the correct line numbers,

03:40:50 15 back. I want all of the -- the relevant parts of 15
03:40:54 16 Virginia Roberts's testimony played. And I 16
03:40:56 17 believe there are approximately four points in 17
03:40:59 18 the transcript where she's mentioned, so can we 18
03:41:00 19 play all four of those? 19
03:41:02 20 MR. SCAROLA: We are not going to do that. 20
03:41:03 21 We have run out of time. Per agreement, this was 21
0141:05 22 supposed to stop at noon. 22
03:41:05 23 MR. SIMPSON: Okay. 23
0341:08 24 MR. SCAROLA: It is now 12:12, so this 24
03:41.09 25 deposition is ended. There were a lot of things 25
