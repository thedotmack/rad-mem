May 19, 2008 
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz, 
I am in receipt of your e-mail dated May 19, 2008 to the United States Attorney. The U.S. 
Attorney would like me to advise you that all communications and inquiries related to the Epstein 
matter, will be handled by AUSA Marie Villafana and/or her supervisor, Karen Atkinson, so he does 
not intend to respond to your e-mail or calls unless AUSA Villafana and/or her supervisors advise 
him otherwise. Furthermore, you make reference to "our July 8 deadline." Respectfully, the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") has never agreed to any such 
deadline. Should you decide to provide the SDFL with any additional information, please do so 
through AUSA Villafana, and, in her absence, AUSA Atkinson. 
On September 24, 2007, your client, Jeffrey Epstein, in consultation with Gerald Lefcourt, 
Esq. and Lilly Ann Sanchez, Esq., as well as numerous other nationally-renowned lawyers, including 
but not limited to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, former Independent Counsel and 
Solicitor General of the United States Kenneth Starr, just to name a few, entered into a global 
resolution of state and federal liabilities faced by your client ("the Agreement") with the SDFL. 
Although you and other members of the defense team have since claimed that the Agreement was 
the product of adhesion, the following facts demonstrate that Epstein knowingly and voluntarily 
entered into the Agreement in order to avoid a federal indictment regarding his sexual conduct 
involving minor victims. Despite the fact that by signing the Agreement, Epstein gave up the right 
to object to its provisions, the SDFL bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider 
your objections. Since these objections have finally been exhausted and Epstein has previously 
expressed his intent to not comply with several of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as set 
forth below, the SDFL hereby notifies you that unless he complies with all of the terms and 
conditions of the Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney's December 19,2007 letter 
to Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will elect to terminate the 
Agreement.

Background 
The Agreement was the product of months of negotiations. Specifically, you requested and 
received numerous meetings, at the highest levels of the SDFL and DOJ's Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section (CEOS) concerning claims that (a) the investigation merely produced evidence 
of relatively innocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Epstein, 
misrepresented their ages; (b) the authorities investigating Epstein engaged in misconduct; (c) the 
contemplated federal statutes have no applicability to this matter; and (d) the federal authorities 
disregarded the fundamental policy against federal intervention with state criminal proceedings. 
After careful review, the SDFL ultimatelyrejected those claims. Subsequent to its decision, however, 
but before proceeding any further, the SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the 
Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Alice Fisher. As you recall, you chose to forego an 
appeal to AAG Fisher, and instead pursued a negotiated resolution which, ultimately, resulted in the 
execution of the Agreement. 
The Negotiation Phase 
During negotiations, you tried to avoid a resolution that called for incarceration and 
registration as a sexual offender — both of which would be triggered by a successful federal 
prosecution. The SDFL believed and continues to believe that should this matter proceed to trial, 
your client would be convicted of the federal statutes identified in the Agreement. In order to achieve 
a global resolution, the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration; 
however, it remained adamant that Epstein register as a sex offender and that all victims identified 
during the investigation remain eligible for compensation. In order to achieve this result, the parties 
considered two alternatives, a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein's sentencing exposure, or, 
as suggested by you, a plea to state charges encompassing Epstein's conduct. Ultimately, the parties 
agreed to, inter alio, a plea to the state charges outlined in the Agreement, registration and a method 
of compensation. 
The Agreement 
The crux of the Agreement defers in favor of the State federal prosecution of Epstein for his 
sexual conduct involving those minor victims identified as of September 24, 2007, in exchange for 
a guilty plea to a state . offense that requires registration as a sex offender; a sufficient term of 
imprisonment; and a method of compensation for the victims such that they would be placed in the 
same position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses set forth in Title 
18, United States Code, Section 2255. Specifically, the Agreement mandates, inter alia, (1) a guilty 
plea in Palm Beach County Circuit Court to solicitation of prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.07) and 
procurement of minors to engage in prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.03) (an offense that requires 
him to register as a sex offender); (2) a 30-month sentence including 18 months' incarceration in 
county jail; (3) a methodology to compensate the victims identified by the United States; (4) entry 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012199

PAGE 3 OF 6 
of the guilty plea and sentence no later than October 26, 2007; and (5) the start of the above-
mentioned sentence no later than January 4, 2008. 
Furthermore, and significantly, Epstein agreed that he had the burden of ensuring compliance 
of the Agreement with the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office and the Judge of the 15th 
Judicial Circuit and "that the failure to do so will be a breach of the agreement" (emphasis added). 
Post-Execution of the Agreement 
Within weeks of the execution of the Agreement, you sought to delay the entry of Epstein's 
guilty plea and sentence. After the SDFL agreed to accommodate your request, counsel for Epstein 
began taking issue with the methodology of compensation, notification to the victims, and the issues 
that had been previously considered and rejected during negotiations, i.e., that the conduct does not 
require registration and the contemplated state and federal statutes have no applicability to the instant 
matter. 
A. Delay. 
The Agreement required that "Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and 
be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no objection to Epstein self-
reporting to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008." Agreement, pages 4-5, 
paragraph 11 (emphasis added). After the Agreement was executed, the SDFL accommodated your 
request to extend the October 26th plea deadline to November 20th based upon, what seemed to be, 
reasonable scheduling conflict issues.' By early November, you represented that the presiding state 
courtjudge would not "stagger the plea and sentencing as contemplated in the Agreement."Although 
the Agreement clearly did not contemplate a staggered "plea and sentencing," the SDFL again agreed 
to accommodate Epstein's request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on January 4, 
2008.2 
I "Accordingly, I have now confirmed with Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's 
attorney's office and the court will be available to have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will 
plan to proceed on one that date." October 18;2007 email from Jay Lefkowitz to USA R. Alexander 
Acosta. 
On the same day, Mr. Lefkowitz confirmed with First Assistant Jeffrey H. Sloman that this 
postponement " will not affect when Epstein begins serving his sentence." 
2 Correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz to FAUSA Sloman dated November 8, 2007 ("the judge 
has invited the parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 41, we do not anticipate any delay 
beyond that date.")

B. Method of Compensation and Notification. 
During this same time period, you and others, including the former Solicitor General of the 
United States Kenneth Starr, took issue with the implementation of the methodology of 
compensation (hereinafter "the 2255 provision")3 and the SDFL's intention to notify the victims 
under 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 (you objected to victims being notified of time and place of Epstein' s 
state court sentencing hearing). In response, the SDFL offered, in my opinion, numerous and various 
reasonable modifications and accommodations which ultimately resulted in United States Attorney 
R. Alexander Acosta's December 19, 2007 letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez. In that letter, the United 
States Attorney tried to eliminate all concerns which, quite frankly, the SDFL was not obligated to 
address, let alone consider. He proposed the following language regarding the 2255 provision: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein been tried federally and convicted of an 
enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall 
provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in 
an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority 
interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens 
if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these 
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been 
convicted at trial. No more; no less." 
Regarding the issue of notice to the victims, USA Acosta proposed to notify them of the 
federal resolution as required by law; however, IN* will defer to the discretion of the State 
Attorney regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings, 
although we will provide him with the information necessary to do so if he wishes." As you know, 
you rejected these proposals as well. See December 26, 2007 correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz 
to USA Acosta. 
3 Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the SDFL 
unilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative for the alleged victims 
to an independent third-party. This was done to avoid even the appearance of favoritism in the selection 
of the attorney representative. As a result, on October 29, 2007, the parties executed an Addendum 
wherein it was mutually agreed that former United States District Court Judge Edward B. Davis would 
serve as the independent third-party. Judge Davis selected the venerable law firm of Podhurst and 
Josefsberg to represent the approximately 34 alleged identified victims.

C. "Mr. Epstein Does Not Believe He Is Guilty Of The Federal Charges Enumerated 
Under Section 2255." 
At our December 14, 2007 meeting at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, counsel for 
Epstein announced, inter alia, that it was a "profound injustice" to require Epstein to register as a 
sex offender and reiterated that no federal crime, especially 18 U.S.C. Section 2422(b), had been 
committed since the statute is only violated if a telephone or means of interstate commerce is used 
to do the persuading or inducing. This particular attack on this statute had been previously raised and 
thoroughly considered and rejected by the SDFL and CEOS prior to the execution of the Agreement. 
You also argued that the facts were inapplicable to the contemplated state statutes and that Epstein 
should not have been allowed to have been induced into the Agreement because the facts were not 
what he understood them to be. It should be noted that the SDFL has never provided you with any 
evidence supporting its investigation. This is not, and has never been, an Alford plea situation (see 
North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160 (1970)). Ultimately, you requested an 
independent review. 
Subsequent to the above-mentioned meeting, the SDFL received three letters from you and/or 
Mr. Starr which expanded on some of the themes announced in the December 14th meeting. 
Essentially, you portrayed the SDFL as trying to coercea plea to unknown allegations and incoherent 
theories. On December 17, 2007, you decreed that Epstein's conduct did not meet the requirements 
•of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.03) one of the enumerated 
crimes Epstein had previously agreed to plead guilty to; that Epstein's conduct does not require 
registration under Florida law; and the State Attorney's Office does not believe the conduct is 
registrable. On December 21, 2007, you rejected the USA's proposed resolution of the 2255 
provision because you "strongly believe that the provable conduct of Mr. Epstein with respect to 
these individuals fails to satisfy the requisite elements of either 18 U.S.C. Section[s] 2422(b) ... or 
2423(b)." In your December 26, 2007 correspondence you stated that "we have reiterated in 
previous submissions that Mr. Epstein does not believe he is guilty of the federal charges enumerated 
under section 2255" and requiring "Mr. Epstein to in essence admit guilt, though he believes he did 
not commit the requisite offense." 
As the SDFL has reiterated time and time again, it does not want, nor does it expect, Epstein 
to plead guilty to a charge he does not believe he committed. As a result, we obliged your request 
for an independent de novo review of the investigation and facilitated such a review at the highest 
levels of the Department of Justice. It is our understanding that that independent review is now 
complete and a determination has been made that there are no impediments to a federal prosecution 
by the SDFL.

Conclusion 
On February 25, 2008, I sent you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward in 
the event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now. As you know, my February 25th 
email stated that I would give you one week to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, as modified by the USA's December 19th letter to Ms. Sanchez. In light of the upcoming 
Memorial Day weekend, I have decided to extend that timetable to the close of business on Monday, 
June 2, 2008, which is a full two weeks.

Several things have come to my attention that seem contrary to your client intending to abide 
by his obligations under the Non-Prosecution Agreement. As you know, that agreement requires our 
Office to inform you of potential breaches to give you and your client the opportunity to respond 
before an indictment is filed. At this time, I do not believe that the agreement has been breached; 
however, I have sufficient concerns that need to be addressed. 
First, I understand that private investigators working for Mr. Epstein have contacted victims 
to ask them whether any detectives or FBI agents have discussed a financial settlement with them. 
On one occasion, the private investigators told the parent of a victim that she should get an attorney 
for her daughter and she should do so right away. These actions are troublesome because the FBI 
agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution or the matter, which includes 
informing them that, as part of the resolution, that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay damages in some 
circumstances. Furthermore, Mr. Epstein well knows that we are in the process of selecting an 
attorney to represent the victims and, but for the inordinate amount of time spent negotiating the 
Addendum, that attorney would already have been selected. Paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement explicitly provides that contact with the victims shall be through that counsel. 
Accordingly, please confirm that there will be no further efforts to contact any victims until Judge 
Davis selects the attorney representative and that, thereafter, contact will be made only through that 
counsel. 
Second, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires Mr. Epstein to use his best efforts to enter 
his guilty plea and to be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. Despite this obligation, the 
Office agreed that Mr. Epstein could postpone this deadline to November, but reiterated that Mr.

Epstein had to begin his term of incarceration not later than January 4, 2008. I have learned that the 
November hearing has been removed from the calendar and the next case disposition conference has 
not been set until January 7, 2008. This delay is unacceptable, and, pursuant to your obligations, the 
Office requests that you confer with the State Attorney's Office to try to find a date in November 
when the judge is available to conduct a simultaneous plea and sentencing, if you cannot find such 
a date, please provide documentation of your efforts to abide by the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. 
Third, there have been several press reports that Mr. Epstein no longer intends to enter a 
guilty plea. Normally I would not pay any attention to such reports, but your recent correspondence 
attempting to restrict our office from communicating with the State .Attorney's Office and the 
allusion to the imposition of sentences that clearly fall outside the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreernent raises concern. Please confirm that Mr. Epstein intends to abide by his agreement to 
plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that the Court impose 
a sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail. 
Finally, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires that you provide the Office with copies of 
all proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office before Mr. Epstein signs any such 
agreements. To date, no such agreements have been received. Please provide me with copies of any 
and all agreements with the State Attorney's Office for our review. The Office also would like to 
have someone present at the change ofplea and sentencing to monitorMr, Epstein's compliance with 
the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, so please keep me informed of the date, time, and 
location of the hearing. 
Please provide me with a written response, adopted by Mr. Epstein, addressing these 
concerns and reiterating Mr. Epstein's intention to comply with the tenns of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement by November 8, 2007.

then I think (inaudible) on the computer and I think he told what 
5 happened and she turned it into an extraordinary, like story so at school so 
6 would look like, you know, like I'm the bad person, like I'm a slut, I'm a whore or 
7 something and she's going around school saying all this stuff and then so my 
8 parents came, cause that's when I got mad at her and told her to stop talking but 
9 she wouldn't stop talking about it. So I just got in a fight with her, like a fist fight 
10 at school. And I got suspended and so did she but she only got suspended for 
11 one day because I started the fight So I got in trouble more. And my dad got 
12 really mad and he grounded me for it, because he found the $300 in my wallet 
13 and then my dad was like, you're grounded, you're grounded forever and he's all 
14 freaking out, how could you do this, blah, blah. The school said you did. And 
15 urn, I didn't tell the school how, I told them I got it from my job, cause I worked at 
15 Chick Filet but I quit. So I said I (inaudible) but nobody believed me so I was just 
17 like believe what you want. Cause I didn't want to tell the principal or my

5 MP: I'm not gonna say, okay? I was made aware of this situation. And they look at it 
6 like you were taken advantage of. Not that you did anything wrong, okay? Even 
7 though you went there willingly. Even though you went there willingly, you were 
8 still taken advantage of. Okay? Because you were put into a position that you 
9 felt you had no choice. Once you were there, before when you were telling me 
10 about how Jeff told you to take off your clothes? You took your pointer and you 
11 said he was really stern and you banged your leg, you put the pointer on your leg 
12 when you said that. How did you feel when he told you to take your clothes off?

22 whacked off twice. When did he do that?

Y other kind of contact th Way YOU 
So thexe. wa,$ no contact at all? 
Okay. Now, I think you just what answered 
8 the question, but let me just ask -- I'm going to do what 
I told you I wouldn't do; I'm going to ask it to you in 
legalese. Before going over to Mr. Epstein's house, did 
anyone try to persuade you to engage in that kind of 
sexual activity or sex with Mr. Epstein? 
A. No. 
Q. Okay. 
A. When had -- because was the 
one that had drove me over there --
Q. Right. 
A. 
told me that would be the 
one driving me -- they were following -- and had 
said that if -- he might ask if I wanted to do anything 
else, that it was up to me, I could say yes or no. She 
said, "He may ask you to do other things." 
Q. But no one was asking you before you --
A. No one was telling me that I had to do 
3 
anything. She was just stating that it was a possibility 2

Q. Most importantly though, before you went 
3 over there, no one tried to persuade you to engage in any 
4 kind of sex? 
5 A. No, no one persuaded me. 
6 
Q. No one was inducing you or enticing you to 
7 do any kind of sex? 
8 
A. No. 
9 Q. 
Okay. And certainly no one that had any 
10 association with Mr. Epstein tried to persuade you or 
11 induce you to engage in any kind of sex? 
12 
A. NO. 
13 Q. Okay. As far as what said to you, 
14 she said he may ask you whether you want to do anything 
15 and it was totally within your rights to decide? 
16 A. Totally within my rights to do whatever 
17 wanted to do. 
18 Q. And I assume she told you that if anything 
19 was asked of you, whether you wanted to do anything else, 
20 I assume told you that Mr. Epstein would 
21 absolutely respect that. In other words, if you were 
22 asked to do anything and you said no, he would say, 
23 "Fine. I understand." 
24 A. Yeah. Because he told me in the room if 
25 didn't want to -- whatever I didn't want to do, just say 
etdaskcisosax. * T 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012264 
no and he said that was fine. 
2 Q. Okay. 
3 A. That's what I was understanding. 
Q. Okay. But that conversation only took 
place after you got to his house, right? 
A. Yeah, right. 
Q. Okay. And going back to, to , she 
8 never communicated to you, with you by e-mail or text 
messaging about any engaging in any kind of sexual 
10 activity? 
11 A. No. It was just that day that I had 
12 decided that I was going to go over there that had 
13 took me over to 's house and then had drove 
14 me there and and followed. 
15 Q. Okay. I know the answer to this is 
16 obvious, because you only went there to Mr. Epstein's 
17 house one time, but I've got to ask you this. You never 
18 traveled anywhere with Mr. Epstein, did you? 
19 A. No. 
20 Q. You never left the state to meet with 
21 Mr. Epstein, did you? 
22 A. No. Heard other girls did. 
23 Q. Okay. Ms. Sanchez just reminded me of a 
24 question I forgot to ask. 
25 You never spoke to on the

2 A. No. 
3 Q. Thank you. 
4 So I think what I'm hearing you tell me is 
5 that your going over there was entirely voluntary; it was 
6 consensual on your part? 
7 
A. It was consensual on my part, yes. 
Q. No one told you that you had to dress in 
9 any particular way? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
A. No. I was wearing jeans and a tee shirt. 
Q. Kind of like today, right? 
A. Exactly. 
Q. Now, you were told that you didn't have to 
14 take your clothes off, right? 
15 A. Yeah. She was -- well, they told me it was 
16 up to me. They said that it was just going to be a 
17 massage. They didn't tell me anything further than that. 
18 They said if he did ask me, it was entirely up to me. 
19 Q. Right. 
20 A. And that was that. 
21 Q. Right. And you were told you could say no 
22 to anything if anything was asked? 
23 
A. Yes. 
24 Q. And that was clearly the atmosphere that 
25 existed when you went to the house?

5 get paid for this massage? 
6 A. Correct. He swiped out my bank account and 
7 I needed a way to come up with $200 that was over my 
8 bank. So I'd get paid 300. I put 200 in my bank and I 
9 believe I gave a hundred for taking me. 
10 Q. Given your debt situation, it was important 
11 to you to convince Mr. Epstein that you were over 18, 
12 because you wanted to do this job? 
13 A. Correct. 
14 Q. Gotcha. Okay. 
15 Believe it or not -- let me just check with 
16 ms, Sanchez, -- but I think I've got everything covered 
17 here. 
18 A. I don't believe it was so much Epstein as 
19 it was the girls that were working for him, that were 
20 bringing in the service, because the girls were the ones 
21 telling everybody to lie, to bring in the business so 
22 that they could get paid. I know he was traveling them 
23 back and forth and renting them rental cars. 
24 Q. So I think what you're telling me is that 
25 you really believe that Mr. Epstein was relying on what

Okay. And clearly, you had some debt based

TAB 11 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012371 
U.S. Department of Justice 
Office of Legislative Affairs 
Office of the Assistant Attorney General Washington, D.C. 20530 
November 9, 2007 
The Honorable John Conyers, Jr. 
Chairman 
Committee on the Judiciary 
U.S. House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C. 20515 
Dear Mr. Chairman: 
This letter presents the views of the Department of Justice (the Department or DOT) on 
H.R. 3887, the "William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 
2007," as introduced by Congressman Lantos on October 18, 2007. The Department has 
significant concerns, which are detailed below in a section-by-section analysis. The proposed 
legislation, as drafted, would eliminate the Department's role in several important steps in the 
victim identification process, and thereby negatively impact our ability to ensure the safety of 
victims and their families, rescue additional victims, and apprehend and prosecute human 
traffickers; it would broaden the criminal statutes regarding prosecution in a manner that detracts 
from effective enforcement efforts and raises serious federalism implications; and it would 
unconstitutionally intrude into Executive authority. 
1. Section 102 
The provision in subsection (e)(2)(B) authorizing the Director of the Office to Monitor 
and Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP) at the Department of State to interview victims 
should clarify that the Director is authorized to do so only with the consent of the Attorney 
General in any case where an ongoing investigation or prosecution may exist. Otherwise, 
serious issues could arise that would complicate or even scuttle prosecution. For example, any 
statements made to the Director would presumptively have to be turned over to the defense and 
any statements that contradict statements made to law enforcement or prosecutors would be 
required to be turned over to the defense. 
2. Section 103 
DOI finds section 103 unnecessary and duplicative of existing efforts and, therefore, 
opposes its inclusion in the bill_ DOJ and other Federal agencies are already offering the types 
of assistance that are described in the section. Furthermore, the new subsection (a)(i)(3) would 
require the United States Government to provide "technical assistance to provide legal 
frameworks and other programs to foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012372 
ensure that foreign migrant workers are provided protection equal to nationals of the foreign 
country." This provision does not differentiate between legal and non-legal migrant workers, nor 
does it distinguish between forced labor and non-coerced migrant labor. DOJ believes that any 
international standard that we promote must mirror our domestic standards. Similarly, the new 
subsection (a)(i)(4) could be read as encouraging countries to loosen their immigration Iaws, 
'something that the United States Government might not be willing to do. 
Subsection (b) amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2151 et seq) to 
provide specific assistance for anti-trafficking investigation and prosecution units in foreign 
countries. This subsection could be construed as prioritizing sex trafficking over labor 
trafficking. As stated above, DOJ believes that any international standard that we promote must 
mirror our domestic standards, which prioritize both sex trafficking and labor trafficking. 
Further, the amendment to 22 U.S.C. § 2152(d)(a)(2) should include a reference to labor 
trafficking and should, therefore, read "including investigation of individuals and entities that 
may be involved in trafficking in persons involving sexual exploitation or forced labor." 
3. Section 104 
The Department objects to the language in this section that specifies the groups with 
which the United States Government must consult and coordinate in offering assistance and 
protection to victims of human trafficking. Such language both places undue restrictions on the 
United States Government and could limit the Government's ability to deal with some necessary 
groups. It has been the consistent practice of the Department to consult widely with a range of 
stake holders and others before designing a program of foreign assistance on human trafficking. 
Such an additional requirement in the statutory language is unnecessary. We suggest that the 
language be amended to read, "[l]n cooperation and coordination with organizations which may 
include the [UNHCl2], the International Organization [for] Migration, and other relevant 
organizations...." 
4. Section 105 
DOJ recommends that subsection (a) also require that the effectiveness of assistance 
programs be measured based on best efforts to facilitate cooperation with law enforcement, along 
with the other criteria. 
5. Section 106 
DOJ opposes the bar in subsection (b)(1) against including cases in which probation or 
low sentences are given. Some of the most important cases are the ones against cooperating 
defendants that result in minimal sentences in exchange for information or testimony. Embassies 
should have the discretion to take such situations into account when evaluating foreign 
government efforts to combat trafficking. The Department recommends amending section 
(b)(1 )(B) by striking "shall not be considered to be an" and inserting in its place "shall be 
considered on a case by case basis to determine if it will be considered an" so that it will give the 
Secretary of State greater flexibility in evaluating the efforts of other countries. 
2 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012373 
The Department also objects to the new paragraph (11), which lists as a criterion for 
ascertaining whether the government in question has made "serious and sustained" efforts to 
eliminate trafficking "[w]hether the government has made serious and sustained efforts to reduce 
demand for commercial sex acts and for participation in international sex tourism by nationals of 
the country." We object to this language because it is vague and will, by implication, require the 
United States Government to evaluate itself under this "serious and sustained" standard. The 
Depatiment prefers the language that was added by the 2005 reauthorization of the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act, which evaluated whether countries "adopted measures" to reduce 
demand. 
6. Section 107 
Section 107(a) of the Act raises separation of powers and Chadha concerns. Section 
I07(a) would add a new 22 U.S.C. § 7107(b)(3)(D), which would limit the amount of time that a 
country could remain on the Tier IT Watch List to two years, "unless the Secretary of State 
provides to the appropriate congressional committees credible evidence that" the country had 
taken certain steps to make significant efforts to counter trafficking. That provision further 
requires that "[s]uch credible evidence" shall be provided to Congress in a report. 
To the extent that section 107(a) purports to give congressional committees authority to 
determine whether the Secretary's decision to exempt a country from the watch list is based on 
sufficiently "credible evidence," the provision would give the committees a role in executing the 
law that the Constitution does not allow. "[O]nce Congress makes its choice in enacting 
legislation, its participation ends. Congress can thereafter control the execution of its enactment 
only indirectly—by passing new legislation"—that complies with the bicameralism and 
presentment requirements of Article I. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 733-34 (1986); ,sree also 
NS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951-52, 958 (1983). To avoid this concern, we recommend 
replacing "provides to the appropriate congressional committees credible evidence" with 
"determines;" and replacing "Such credible evidence" with "Such determination." 
7. Section 108 
DOJ opposes the requirement in section 108 to create a database "combining all 
applicable data collected by each Federal department and agency represented on the Interagency 
Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking." The database would contain law enforcement 
sensitive information, which would prevent the data from being accessible to non-law 
enforcement agencies, many of which are a part of the interagency task force. Furthermore, such 
a database would be difficult to create, particularly within the timeframe provided in the statute, 
because it would require information from multiple agencies that collect data in varying forms 
and levels of specificity. 
8. Section 109 
This section authorizes the President to establish an award for efforts against trafficking 
and directs him to establish procedures for selecting recipients of the award. DOJ opposes this 
provision, as it interferes with the President's policy-making authority. 
3 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012374 
9. Section. 110 
The Department opposes the statutory language in subsection I 10(a)(1)(B) that 
specifically mentions the U.S. Government sponsored hotlines for reporting instances of 
trafficking in persons. Statutorily providing for the names of the hotlines would interfere with 
the President's policy-making authority to change the hotline structure at a later date. 
Furthermore, the Act, as written, misnames the hotlines. 
10. Section 201  
In section 201, the Department objects to the new subsection "(bb)." To the extent that 
such a subsection is necessary, a question that we defer to the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS), the decision regarding cooperation should include the Attorney General in addition to the 
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, as it does in Section 201(b). 
DOI. defers to DHS in regard to subsection (a)(1)(E), although we would note that by 
removing the "unusual and severe harm" standard, victims will be eligible for a T-visa upon a 
lower showing of "extreme hardship." 
The Department also defers to DHS in regard to subsection (a)(2), which would extend 
T-visas to parents and siblings of trafficking victims. As a factual matter, however, the provision 
should be amended to strike any reference to "as a result of the alien's cooperation with law 
enforcement." Traffickers threaten victims to intimidate them into compliance with traffickers' 
demands and to retaliate for victims' escape, not because of law enforcement cooperation. It is 
counter-factual to describe the pattern of threats and retaliation as linked to law enforcement 
cooperation, and disregards the fact that threats often only subside when law enforcement takes 
measures to secure the family or punish the traffickers and their associates who threaten victims' 
families. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the reference to siblings encompasses both minor 
and adult siblings, and whether spouses and children of adult siblings would be eligible for a T-
visa. 
In subsection (b), DOJ opposes the new subsection (8)(B), which grants sole authority to 
the Secretary of DHS to consider whether "extreme hardship" exists. The new section, however, 
also requires consultation with "prosecutors," which presumably refers to prosecutors at DOJ, 
since DOJ is the lead prosecutorial agency for cases involving human trafficking. Since these 
prosecutors are under the Attorney General's authority, the consultation requirement should 
include consultation with the Attorney General. 
Subsection (c)(1), which creates the new subsection (3)(A)(i) in section 107(c) of the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), should limit applications for continued presence to 
those being made by "Federal" law enforcement officials. Limiting the applications to those 
submitted by Federal law enforcement assists in the victim identification process. The 
Department has established a memorandum of understanding with DHS that ensures that the 
Department's prosecutors are informed when investigators apply for continued presence. 
Furthermore, limiting the applications to those submitted by Federal law enforcement ensures the 
uniformity of standards in making the determination as to whether an individual is a victim of a 
4 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012375 
severe form of trafficking in persons and eligible for continued presence. Finally, Federal law 
enforcement involvement in the process allows Federal prosecutors the ability to identify 
patterns of human trafficking activity that might span multiple local law enforcement 
jurisdictions. For these same reasons, the new subsection (3)(B) should add "Federal" before 
"law enforcement" to limit the authority to request parole for relatives to Federal law 
enforcement officials. 
The new subsection (c)(3)(A)(ii) should add "endeavor to" after "shall" so that a legally 
actionable obligation is not created as to Federal law enforcement's role in protecting the safety 
of trafficking victims and family members. While the U.S. Government makes every effort to 
protect trafficking victims, the statutory language, as written, could be construed to create a 
legally cognizable right and could lead to litigation. 
In the new subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii), DOJ opposes extending continued presence for the 
duration of a civil suit. It also raises the potential for abuse because of the lengthy and 
plaintiff/victim-controlled delays in conducting civil litigation. Furthermore, physical presence 
in the United States is not necessary for the successful maintenance of a civil action. Victims 
have other options to obtain status in the United States, such as T- and U-visas. 
DOJ notes a technical change to subsection (d), which currently has two subsection (2)s. 
DOJ recommends striking the second "(2)" and replacing it with a "(3)." 
11. Section 202 
The Department opposes the language in section (a) that legislates the existence of a 
specific task force, such as the Trafficking in Persons and Worker Exploitation Task Force. DOJ 
recommends deletion of this reference and the replacement of the named task force with "the 
Attorney General." 
DOJ also opposes the 120 day deadline in subsection (f) as unreasonable due to language 
barriers and translation needs. 
12. Section 203 
In subsections (a), (b)(1-2), and (c), DOJ opposes the language removing the Attorney 
General's role in determining whether the relevant applicant has complied with reasonable 
requests for assistance, an important factor in the decisions regarding T-visas, and that the 
investigation or prosecution is complete. Because the Department is involved in its prosecutorial 
as well as its investigative roles, DOJ participation is critical in assessing assistance with law 
enforcement, and it is well-situated to assess whether a victim has complied with reasonable 
requests for assistance that went through investigative agencies outside DHS, such as cases 
investigated by FBI or DOL. Therefore, a joint determination is appropriate because of the 
number of different law enforcement agencies that may be involved in a particular matter. 
5 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012376 
13. Section 205 
D0.1 opposes the addition of the new subsection 240A(b)(6)(A) of the Immigration and 
Nationality 21 Act (8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)) unless the word "Federal" is added before "law 
enforcement official." The same proposed subsection currently states that the Secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Security "shall grant parole" to the relatives of trafficking victims. 
DOI. recommends changing this language to read "may grant parole" so the Secretary has the 
latitude to make an appropriate decision. There may be reasons pertaining to the circumstances 
of the relatives of the trafficking victim for which the Secretary should have discretion to deny 
parole. Further, DOJ finds it necessary to strike any reference to "as a result of the alien's 
cooperation with law enforcement" for the reasons noted above. 
In subsection, (6)(B)(ii)(II), DOI opposes a statutory requirement that parole be extended 
during pending civil actions. As indicated above, this action would create a potential for abuse 
because of the lengthy and plaintiff/victim-controlled delays in conducting civil litigation. 
14. Section 211  
The Department opposes the change of the "and" in subsection (1)(A) to an "or." Both 
the Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS need to be involved in the certification process. 
The current certification process is well-established and needs no statutory revisions. DOJ also 
opposes the change in subsection (1)(B), which would remove the Attorney General's authority 
in stating whether a person's presence is necessary in ensuring an effective prosecution. As the 
agency that prosecutes cases of human trafficking, DOrs involvement is vitally important. The 
Department has the same concern with the proposed change in subsection (2). 
15. Section 213 
We strongly oppose the language in this section that inappropriately removes law 
enforcement from any initial determination of victim status or benefits eligibility. DOJ and DHS 
play a critical role in protecting the safety of victims and service providers. Any failure to 
involve Federal law enforcement immediately upon suspicion that a crime has been committed 
could threaten the safety of the victim, impeded efforts to promptly rescue victims still in 
jeopardy, and possibly man that the offenders avoid apprehension. DOJ recognizes the 
important of including HHS at the initial stages for the purpose of facilitating prompt delivery of 
the full range of available benefits and services to trafficking victims. DOJ will continue to work 
with DHS and BM to ensure that interagency procedures afford victims of trafficking prompt 
protection and access to these services. 
The Department further objects to the provision set forth in paragraph (G), which would 
require both Federal and state law enforcement officials to inform the Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) of the existence of a potential victim, but does not require HHS, other 
Government officials, or non-governmental service providers to inform Federal or state law 
enforcement of such a victim. To the extent that such a notification procedure must exist, it must 
also include notification to the Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS, who bear 
responsibility for prosecuting and investigating instances of human trafficking. 
6 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012377 
DOJ also opposes subsection (b). Since the passage of the TVPA, DOS has been one of 
the principal agencies conducting trainings for a multitude of audiences, including task forces 
and Federal, state, and local law enforcement, on the issue of trafficking in persons. The 
Department also has experience in conducting training on juvenile victims through the Innocence 
Lost National Initiative. Effective efforts to combat trafficking must mobilize the expertise of 
HHS, DHS, and DOJ. 
DOJ also notes a misspelling in the new subsection (F)(ii)— "edibility" instead of 
"eligibility". 
16. Section 214 
Section 214 of the bill authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to assist victims of 
severe forms of trafficking up to $2.5 million in 2008, increasing to $15 million in 2011. The 
Department of Justice already has authority to make grants for the provision of services for crime 
victims and does so at a level in excess of $250 million a year. Also, the authorization of yet 
another grant program runs counter to the Administration's proposal in the 2008 Budget to 
consolidate DOJ's more than 70 grant programs. 
Moreover, any provision purporting to expand or alter definitions of individuals of 
qualifying for victim benefits must include the requirement that a Federal law enforcement agent 
must declare the individual to be a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and that the 
victim agree to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution, or that the victim be under the age 
of 18. 
DOJ opposes the consultation requirement in subsection (a)(1) with the Secretary of State 
for establishing programs to serve domestic, U.S. citizen trafficking victims. Such domestic 
authority falls outside of the mission and expertise of the Department of State. DOJ also opposes 
the mandatory consultation with non-government organizations (NG0s) regarding the provision 
of services. This creates a conflict of interest since many of the NGOs will apply for and could 
receive grants under the program. Finally, any section regarding the provision of victim services 
must also contain language that includes organizations that provide services to "juveniles 
subjected to trafficking, as defined in section 203(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act of 2005," which would ensure that the funds authorized to the Attorney 
General for establishment of grants will go toward the work and development of the Innocence 
Lost Task Forces. 
DOS opposes subsection (b) because it provides Victims of Crime Act of 1984 funds to 
prostitutes implicated in violations of the Mann Act (criminalizing transportation of prostitutes in 
interstate commerce). Such persons do not meet the legal defmition of "victim" as that term is 
defined in the law, unless the person prostituted is under the age of 18 at the time the crime was 
committed or the person, through the application of another Federal statute or regulation, 
satisfies the legal definition of a victim. Such persons are already eligible under the Crime 
Victims Fund Act to receive benefits. 
7 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012378 
Dar opposes section 214(d), as it could be construed to require the Attorney General and 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make legislative recommendations to Congress in 
violation of the Recommendations Clause. To avoid this concern, we recommend inserting ", if 
any," after "recommendations" in section 214(d)(2)(E). Further, DOJ finds subsection (d) 
redundant. A thorough study of services available to domestic and foreign victims was 
conducted by the Senior Policy Operating Group in 2005-2006 and found few statutory 
differences between the treatment of domestic and foreign victims. 
Subsection (d)(2)(C) contains a redundant statement. Victims of sex trafficking are 
victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons. 
17. Section 221  
In subsection (a), DOJ opposes the proposed change of MO*g thc içhw!edgc, of 
AgOI0000000#0i010404:03 to:i',14Y.PF*Vir.,01go!, 
This change of law would 
create a strict liability crime, similar to 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with similarly severe 10 year 
mandatory minimum sentence. However,16W04004kig44(a)**40#Xa) is exceedingly 
.1iii*KtiiitifitAkt0A0t***.grilgOgogfogoo Therefore, the suggested subsection (a) 
would create a rare circumstance wherein there is a substantial mandatory minimum sentence for 
an already unusual strict liability crime. Accordingly, this provision is likely to face significant 
legal challenges. 
DOJ opposes subsection (b) in its entirety, The proposed language is both over-inclusive 
and under-inclusive of human trafficking activities, and the language is vague. Moreover, the 
provision is unnecessary because section 1589 already prohibits many of these activities when 
they result in "serious harm," whether physical or emotional, to the victim. 
The Department opposes subsection (0(1), which would expand the Mann Act to include 
cases "affecting" interstate commerce. The Department does not require any additional statutory 
authority or expanded jurisdiction in order to continue its successful prosecution of human 
trafficking cases and related criminal conduct. Agrg#0.0,:01010::*:-which  ',!ktdtt*.-

important structural allocations of responsibility between state and Federal governments. The 
federalization of these crimes would treat them differently than other serious crimes such as 
murder and rape, which are prosecuted at the state level. Kidnapping, similarly, is a Federal 
crime only when it involves transportation "in" interstate commerce. .

DOJ also opposes subsection (g), which would expand the sex tourism offenses to 
include those who travel for purposes of illicit sexual activity with adults. The Department's 
current efforts with regard to extraterritorial offenses focus on child sex tourism, which are very 
demanding and resource-intensive cases, requiring gathering evidence abroad, bringing victims 
to the United States to testify, and coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and 
foreign governments generally, among other matters. Any expansion of authority would be a 
distraction from those priority cases and would exacerbate existing burdens on investigation and 
prosecution. 
The Department believes that the addition of 18 U.S.C. § 2423A is unnecessary and that 
18 U.S.C. § 2423 does not need to be amended. 
Should Congress create 18 U.S.C. § 2423A, DOJ believes that language should be 
retained in 18 U.S.C. § 2423(e) that allows the Government to charge attempt or conspiracy for 
18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) crimes. Finally, DOJ notes that the definition of illicit sexual conduct 
needs to be updated to include production of child pornography. 
18. Section 222 
As a general matter, the Department opposes the expansion of jurisdiction over offenses 
involving non-American offenders or victims that are committed outside the United States. The 
expansion ofjurisdietion in this section would place an enormous strain on available resources. 
In addition, this new section's jurisdiction description overlaps with 18 U.S.C. § 3271. Should 
the choice be made to keep the jurisdictional provisions provided for in this section, perhaps it 
would be more effective to expand section 3271. 
19. Section 223 
These provisions are not directly related to trafficking. As this section is related to aliens 
brought into the country for the purposes of prostitution, without a showing of force, fraud, or 
coercion, and the International Marriage Brokers Act (IMBRA), this bill is not the vehicle for 
this language. Furthermore, subsection (a)(1) removes the requirement from section 278 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act that such conduct be done in furtherance of the importation of 
the alien. By removing this requirement, the bill extends the statute to cover all instances of 
"pimping" an alien. 
9 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012380 
20. Section 224 
This section misunderstands the purpose and effect of the model law and should be 
deleted. The Department's model law was never designed to supplant pre-existing state laws 
which target pimping, pandering, or prostitution, but rather to supplement those laws. At the 
time that the Department's model law was issued, most states had comprehensive laws 
addressing prostitution, pimping, and pandering. However, most states did not have laws 
focused on human trafficking. The Department's law was designed to raise awareness of the 
issue of trafficking and to encourage states to closely examine cases to ensure that cases 
involving fraud, force, and coercion are not labeled as prostitution offenses. The Department 
believes the law has been successful in accomplishing this goal. 
2L Section 231 
The Department opposes any statutory changes to the annual report. The change in 
subsection (1) is unnecessary as this language is currently included in the annual report. The 
information requested in the new subsection (I) would be excessively burdensome to gather. 
22. Section 232 
DOJ opposes this addition as unnecessary. Human trafficking laws that do not require 
the proof of force, fraud, or coercion, namely laws that concern minor victims of severe forms of 
human trafficking, are already discussed at the annual conferences. To the extent that this 
provision would require the Department to discuss human trafficking laws pertaining to adult 
victims that do not require the showing of force, fraud, or coercion, such laws would not fail 
under the definition of human trafficking and the annual conference would be an inappropriate 
venue for the discussion of such laws. However, DOJ trafficking prosecutors utilize a wide 
range of statutes in addition to Chapter 77 offenses to address all criminal conduct associated 
with human trafficking. This includes the Mann Act, money laundering, visa fraud, immigration 
offenses, criminal labor violations, and extortion, in addition to other criminal statutes. 
Accordingly, DOJ training at annual conferences, the National Advocacy Center, the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and field training with the Department of Justice 
funded Human Trafficking Task Forces and provided through the Innocence Lost National 
Initiative include discussion on the importance of using all available criminal statutes as essential 
tools in charging decisions. Thus, this section is unnecessary. 
23. Section 233 
DOJ opposes the change to section 206 of the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act of 2005, which would remove the discretion of agencies in informing the 
Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) of grants. Such a change could be read as giving the 
SPOG oversight authority over grants. It also fails to take into consideration situations where 
grant-making agencies may be unable to notify the SPOG of the grant. 
10 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012381 
24. Section 234 
The Department opposes subsection (a) as an excessively burdensome and unnecessary 
creation of a new layer of bureaucracy within our agency. The Department does not believe 
that there is currently any lack of coordination, and a new position could lead to duplication of 
efforts. Furthermore, subsection (a)(2)(A) incorrectly lists the Civil Division and not the Civil 
Rights Division. 
25. Section 236 
In subsection (a), DOJ questions the reliability of the congressional findings, especially 
with respect to the estimated number of victims and the inference that the lack of child victims is 
directly related to a lack of education individuals who may come into contact with human 
trafficking victims. Such findings, without a full body of evidence, are counter-productive. 
The Department also opposes subsection (b). The Attorney General should be involved 
in any program that focuses on combating child trafficking at the border. We propose that 
section (b)(1) is amended to read "The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the 
Secretary of State, Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services." Further, 
most of the children interdicted at the border are used for smuggling and are not trafficking 
victims, In subsection (b)(5)(D), DOJ believes that the proceedings for removal to non-
contiguous countries are problematic because DHS needs more flexibility to handle gang 
members, terrorists, repeat offenders, and state offenders. Furthermore, the terrorism exception 
provided is too narrow to protect the national security interests of the country. 
We oppose subsection (c)(1) to the extent that it limits the Administration's ability to 
determine the best arrangement for custody or various classes of UACs. The administration will 
work with DHS, DOJ, and MIS to refme and modify current detention practices where 
necessary. The interagency process is the best forum to consider the various interests of 
unaccompanied minors and law enforcement and to develop and adapt policies that, among other 
things, provide for the safety of all concerned. We look forward to discussing these 
developments with Congress in the future. 
The Department opposes subsection (d)(2) as too narrowly construed. There are 
numerous reasons, outside of the child proving to be a danger to himself or others, that require 
children to be kept in a secure facility, including the safety of the child from danger that is not 
self-imposed. In addition, the standard for placing minors in "secure" care is too strict. It 
requires the "least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child." HE-IS only places 1.4 
percent of minors in its care into a "secure" custody arrangement. This could mean that minors 
who need this arrangement would instead be housed with children who have no history of 
violence or criminal behavior. HHS needs more flexibility and there should not, therefore, be 
required to make an "independent finding" of the child's danger to self or others. 
DOJ opposes the language of subsection (d)(3Xc) that would afford HHS access to law 
enforcement sensitive databases. 
11 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012382 
The language of subsection (d)(5) must be changed from "shall ensure." This implies a 
legal obligation on the Federal government to provide counsel and a concomitant right on behalf 
of victims to government-funded counsel, which is inappropriate and would subject the 
government to litigation over the nature and scope of the purported obligation and right. 
The Department also opposes subsection (d)(6), which creates a guardian ad 'item 
program. Such program raises serious conflict of interest concerns, and DOJ has opposed similar 
language in the past. Establishment of a guardian ad [item program is also unnecessary in that 18 
U.S.C. §3509(h) already sets forth detailed procedures which provide for court appointed 
guardians ad litem for children who are victims of or witnesses to crimes involving abuse or 
exploitation. 
Subsection (d)(7) may result in unintended consequences due to this confidentiality 
section. To effectively combat trafficking, relevant information must be transmitted to law 
enforcement. Law enforcement is well-equipped to preserve confidentiality concerns, 
The Department believes that subsection (e) undermines the 1997 Special Immigrant 
Juvenile reforms and opposes turning this back over to the states, where it was inherently flawed. 
In section 236(j), the effect of the apparent retroactivity of the general applicability of 
these amendments to "all aliens in the United States before, on, or after the date of enactment of 
this Act" raises serious concerns about the provision of benefits and services and has the 
potential to create serious problems for the Department in its implementation of the programs 
described in this section. 
26. Section 301 
DOJ recommends striking the 2 percent cap on funding for training and technical 
assistance that is in 22 U.S.C. 7105(b)(2)(B). The unique.complexity of the trafficking issue and 
the level of coordination necessary to effectively serve trafficking victims requires much more 
training and technical assistance than a typical OP program. Striking the cap on training and 
technical assistance will allow OJP to better allocate the trafficking funds it receives. The 
change could be implemented by the following statutory language: 
"Paragraph 107(b)(2)(B)of Pub. L. 106-386 is amended by: 
"(I) inserting 'and' after the first semicolon; 
"(2) striking '(ii)' through ';and'; and 
"(3) striking 'OW and inserting `(ii)." 
27. Section 302 
Section 302 re-authorizes the $5,000,000 appropriation for the Pilot Program that was 
first authorized by Section 203 of the 2005 version of this Act. The 2007 version, therefore, 
should add language amending section 203 of the 2005 version to provide that HHS does not 
have the exclusive authority for development of the pilot program. DOJ and DES must be 
included in the development of this program to ensure that the ability of Federal prosecutors and 
12 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012383 
law enforcement to gain access to these victims is not negatively impacted. Moreover, the 
Departments' knowledge about these victims, their behaviors, and the dangers that are inherent 
in providing shelter and services to them would be instrumental to ensuring the success of the 
pilot program. This section should also amend subsection 203(a) of the 2005 reauthorization to 
include after "Secretary of Health and Human Services", "in collaboration with the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security," Subsection 203(c) should be likewise 
amended. 
The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the 
presentation of this letter from the standpoint of the Administration's programs.

PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO DECLINE TO EXECUTE 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL STATUTES 
This memorandum discusses the President's constitutional authority to decline to execute 
unconstitutional statutes. 
November 2, 1994 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE ABNER J. MIICVA 
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT 
I have reflected further on the difficult questions surrounding a President's decision to decline to 
execute statutory provisions that the President believes are unconstitutional, and I have a few thoughts 
to share with you. Let me start with a general proposition that I believe to be uncontroversial: there are 
circumstances in which the President may appropriately decline to enforce a statute that he views as 
unconstitutional. 
First, there is significant judicial approval of this proposition. Most notable is the Court's decision 
in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). There the Court sustained the President's view that the 
statute at issue was unconstitutional without any member of the Court suggesting that the President had 
acted improperly in refusing to abide by the statute. More recently, in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 
U.S. 868 (1991), all four of the Justices who addressed the issue agreed that the President has "the 
power to veto encroaching laws . . . or even to disregard them when they are unconstitutional." Id. at 
906 (Scalia, J., concurring); see also Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 
(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (recognizing existence of President's authority to act contrary to a 
statutory command). 
Second, consistent and substantial executive practice also confirms this general proposition. 
Opinions dating to at least 1860 assert the President's authority to decline to effectuate enactments that 
the President views as unconstitutional. See, e.g., Memorial of Captain Meigs, 9 Op. Att'y Gen. 462, 
469-70 (1860) (asserting that the President need not enforce a statute purporting to appoint an officer); 
see also annotations of attached Attorney General and Office of Legal Counsel opinions. Moreover, as 
we discuss more fully below, numerous Presidents have provided advance notice of their intention not 
to enforce specific statutory requirements that they have viewed as unconstitutional, and the Supreme 
Court has implicitly endorsed this practice. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 942 n.13 (1983) (noting 
that Presidents often sign legislation containing constitutionally objectionable provisions and indicate 
that they will not comply with those provisions). 
While the general proposition that in some situations the President may decline to enforce 
unconstitutional statutes is unassailable, it does not offer sufficient guidance as to the appropriate 
course in specific circumstances. To continue our conversation about these complex issues, I offer the 
following propositions for your consideration. 
1. The President's office and authority are created and bounded by the Constitution; he is required to 
act within its terms. Put somewhat differently, in serving as the executive created by the Constitution, 
the President is required to act in accordance with the laws -- including the Constitution, which takes 
precedence over other forms of law. This obligation is reflected in the Take Care Clause and in the 
President's oath of office. 
2. When bills are under consideration by Congress, the executive branch should promptly identify 
unconstitutional provisions and communicate its concerns to Congress so that the provisions can be 
corrected. Although this may seem elementary, in practice there have been occasions in which the 
President has been presented with enrolled bills containing constitutional flaws that should have been 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012386 
corrected in the legislative process. 
3. The President should presume that enactments are constitutional. There will be some occasions, 
however, when a statute appears to conflict with the Constitution. In such cases, the President can and 
should exercise his independent judgment to determine whether the statute is constitutional. In 
reaching a conclusion, the President should give great deference to the fact that Congress passed the 
statute and that Congress believed it was upholding its obligation to enact constitutional legislation. 
Where possible, the President should construe provisions to avoid constitutional problems. 
4. The Supreme Court plays a special role in resolving disputes about the constitutionality of 
enactments. As a general matter, if the President believes that the Court would sustain a particular 
provision as constitutional, the President should execute the statute, notwithstanding his own beliefs 
about the constitutional issue. If, however, the President, exercising his independent judgment, 
determines both that a provision would violate the Constitution and that it is probable that the Court 
would agree with him, the President has the authority to decline to execute the statute. 
5. Where the President's independent constitutional judgment and his determination of the Court's 
probable decision converge on a conclusion of unconstitutionality, the President must make a decision 
about whether or not to comply with the provision. That decision is necessarily specific to context, and 
it should be reached after careful weighing of the effect of compliance with the provision on the 
constitutional rights of affected individuals and on the executive branch's constitutional authority. Also 
relevant is the likelihood that compliance or non-compliance will permit judicial resolution of the 
issue. That is, the President may base his decision to comply (or decline to comply) in part on a desire 
to afford the Supreme Court an opportunity to review the constitutional judgment of the legislative 
branch. 
6. The President has enhanced responsibility to resist unconstitutional provisions that encroach upon 
the constitutional powers of the Presidency. Where the President believes that an enactment 
unconstitutionally limits his powers, he has the authority to defend his office and decline to abide by it, 
unless he is convinced that the Court would disagree with his assessment. If the President does not 
challenge such provisions (i.e., by refusing to execute them), there often will be no occasion for 
judicial consideration of their constitutionality; a policy of consistent Presidential enforcement of 
statutes limiting his power thus would deny the Supreme Court the opportunity to review the 
limitations and thereby would allow for unconstitutional restrictions on the President's authority. 
Some legislative encroachments on executive authority, however, will not be justiciable or are for 
other reasons unlikely to be resolved in court. If resolution in the courts is unlikely and the President 
cannot look to a judicial determination, he must shoulder the responsibility of protecting the 
constitutional role of the presidency. This is usually true, for example, of provisions limiting the 
President's authority as Commander in Chief. Where it is not possible to construe such provisions 
constitutionally, the President has the authority to act on his understanding of the Constitution. 
One example of a Presidential challenge to a statute encroaching upon his powers that did result in 
litigation was Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). In that case, President Wilson had defied a 
statute that prevented him from removing postmasters without Senate approval; the Supreme Court 
ultimately struck down the statute as an unconstitutional limitation on the President's removal power. 
Myers is particularly instructive because, at the time President Wilson acted, there was no Supreme 
Court precedent on point and the statute was not manifestly unconstitutional. In fact, the 
constitutionality of restrictions on the President's authority to remove executive branch officials had 
been debated since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act in 1867 over President Johnson's veto. The 
closeness of the question was underscored by the fact that three Justices, including Justices Holmes and 
Brandeis, dissented in Myers. Yet, despite the unsettled constitutionality of President Wilson's action, 
no member of the Court in Myers suggested that Wilson overstepped his constitutional authority -- or 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012387 
even acted improperly -- by refusing to comply with a statute he believed was unconstitutional. The 
Court in Myers can be seen to have implicitly vindicated the view that the President may refuse to 
comply with a statute that limits his constitutional powers if he believes it is unconstitutional. As 
Attorney General Civiletti stated in a 1980 opinion, 
Myers is very nearly decisive of the issue [of Presidential denial of the validity of statutes]. 
Myers holds that the President's constitutional duty does not require him to execute 
unconstitutional statutes; nor does it require him to execute them provisionally, against the 
day that they are declared unconstitutional by the courts. He cannot be required by statute 
to retain postmasters against his will unless and until a court says that he may lawfully let 
them go. If the statute is unconstitutional, it is unconstitutional from the start. 
The Attorney General's Duty to Defend and Enforce Constitutionally Objectionable Legislation, 4A 
Op. O.L.C. 55, 59 (1980). 
7. The fact that a sitting President signed the statute in question does not change this analysis. The 
text of the Constitution offers no basis for distinguishing bills based on who signed them; there is no 
constitutional analogue to the principles of waiver and estoppel. Moreover, every President since 
Eisenhower has issued signing statements in which he stated that he would refuse to execute 
unconstitutional provisions. See annotations of attached signing statements. As we noted in our 
memorandum on Presidential signing statements, the President "may properly announce to Congress 
and to the public that he will not enforce a provision of an enactment he is signing. If so, then a signing 
statement that challenges what the President determines to be an unconstitutional encroachment on his 
power, or that announces the President's unwillingness to enforce (or willingness to litigate) such a 
provision, can be a valid and reasonable exercise of Presidential authority." Memorandum for Bernard 
N. Nussbaum, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, Office of 
Legal Counsel at 4 (Nov. 3, 1993). (Of course, the President is not obligated to announce his 
reservations in a signing statement; he can convey his views in the time, manner, and form of his 
choosing.) Finally, the Supreme Court recognized this practice in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983): 
the Court stated that "it is not uncommon for Presidents to approve legislation containing parts which 
are objectionable on constitutional grounds" and then cited the example of President Franklin 
Roosevelt's memorandum to Attorney General Jackson, in which he indicated his intention not to 
implement an unconstitutional provision in a statute that he had just signed. Id. at 942 n.13. These 
sources suggest that the President's signing of a bill does not affect his authority to decline to enforce 
constitutionally objectionable provisions thereof. 
• In accordance with these propositions, we do not believe that a President is limited to choosing 
between vetoing, for example, the Defense Appropriations Act and executing an unconstitutional 
provision in it. In our view, the President has the authority to sign legislation containing desirable 
elements while refusing to execute a constitutionally defective provision. 
We recognize that these issues are difficult ones. When the President's obligation to act in accord 
with the Constitution appears to be in tension with his duty to execute laws enacted by Congress, 
questions are raised that go to the heart of our constitutional structure. In these circumstances, a 
President should proceed with caution and with respect for the obligation that each of the branches 
shares for the maintenance of constitutional government.

Brief Description of Attached Materials 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012388 
Attorney General Opinions 
1) Memorial of Captain Meigs, 9 Op. Atry Gen. 462 (1860): In this opinion the Attorney General 
concluded that the President is permitted to disregard an unconstitutional statute. Specifically, Attorney 
General Black concluded that a statute purporting to appoint an officer should not be enforced: "Every 
law is to be carried out so far forth as is consistent with the Constitution, and no further. The sound part 
of it must be executed, and the vicious portion of it suffered to drop." Id. at 469. 
2) Constitutionality of Congress' Disapproval of Agency Regulations by Resolutions Not Presented to  
the President, 4A Op. O.L.C. 21 (1980): In this opinion Attorney General Civiletti instructed Secretary 
of Education Hufstedler that she was authorized to implement regulations that had been disapproved by 
concurrent congressional resolutions, pursuant to a statutory legislative veto. The Attorney General• 
noted that "the Attorney General must scrutinize with caution any claim that he or any other executive 
officer may decline to defend or enforce a statute whose constitutionality is merely in doubt." Id. at 29. 
He concluded, however, that "[t]o regard these concurrent resolutions as legally binding would impair 
the Executive's constitutional role and might well foreclose effective judicial challenge to their 
constitutionality. More important, I believe that your recognition of these concurrent resolutions as 
legally binding would constitute an abdication of the responsibility of the executive branch, as an equal 
and coordinate branch of government with the legislative branch, to preserve the integrity of its 
functions against constitutional encroachment." Id. 
3) The Attorney General's Duty to Defend and Enforce Constitutionally Objectionable Legislation, 4A 
Op. O.L.C. 55 (1980): Attorney General Civiletti, in answer to a congressional inquiry, observed that 
"Myers holds that the President's constitutional duty does not require him to execute unconstitutional 
statutes; nor does it require him to execute them provisionally, against the day that they are declared 
unconstitutional by the courts." Id. at 59. He added as a cautionary note that "[t]he President has no 
'dispensing power," meaning that the President and his subordinates "may not lawfully defy an Act of 
Congress if the Act is constitutional. . . . In those rare instances in which the Executive may lawfully 
act in contravention of a statute, it is the Constitution that dispenses with the operation of the statute. 
The Executive cannot." Id. at 59-60. 
4) Letter from William French Smith, Attorney General, to Peter W. Rodino, Jr., Chairman, House  
Judiciary Committee (Feb. 22 1985): This letter discussed the legal precedent and authority for the 
President's refusal to execute a provision of the Competition in Contracting Act. The Attorney General 
noted that the decision "not to implement the disputed provisions has the beneficial byproduct of 
increasing the likelihood of a prompt judicial resolution. Thus, far from unilaterally nullifying an Act 
of Congress, the Department's actions are fully consistent with the allocation of judicial power by the 
Constitution to the courts." Id. at 8. The letter also stated that "the President's failure to veto a measure 
does not prevent him subsequently from challenging the Act in court, nor does presidential approval of 
an enactment cure constitutional defects." Id. at 3. 
Office of Legal Counsel Opinions 
1) Memorandum to the Honorable Robert J. Lipshutz, Counsel to the President, from John M.  
Harmon, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Sept. 27, 1977): This opinion 
concluded that the President may lawfully disregard a statute that he interprets to be unconstitutional. 
We asserted that "cases may arise in which the unconstitutionality of the relevant statute will be 
certain, and in such a case the Executive could decline to enforce the statute for that reason alone." Id. 
at 13. We continued, stating that "[u]nless the unconstitutionality of a statute is clear, the President 
should attempt to resolve his doubts in a way that favors the statute, and he should not decline to 
enforce it unless he concludes that he is compelled to do so under the circumstances." Id. We declined 
to catalogue all the considerations that would weigh in favor of non-enforcement, but we identified 
two: first the extent of the harm to individuals or the government resulting from enforcement; and, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012389 
second, the creation of an opportunity for a court challenge through non-enforcement (e.g., Myers). 
2) Appropriations Limitation for Rules Vetoed by Congress, 4B Op. 0.L.C. 731 (1980): In this 
opinion we rejected the constitutionality of a proposed legislative veto, prior to the Court's decision in 
Chadha. We opined that "[t]o regard this provision as legally binding would impair the Executive's 
constitutional role and would constitute an abdication of the responsibility of the Executive Branch." 
Id. at 734. It should be noted that the legislation in question was pending in Congress, and the 
possibility that President Carter would sign the legislation did not affect our analysis of the 
constitutional issue. We simply stated that, "if enacted, the [legislative veto provision] will not have 
any legal effect." Id. 
3) Issues Raised by Section 102(c)(2) of H.R. 3792, 14 Op. O.L.C. 38 (1990) (preliminary print): This 
opinion also addressed then-pending legislation, in this case the foreign relations authorization bill for 
fiscal years 1990 and 1991. The opinion found that a provision of the bill was unconstitutional and 
severable. Regarding non-execution, the opinion stated that "at least in the context of legislation that 
infringes the separation of powers, the President has the constitutional authority to refuse to enforce 
unconstitutional laws." Id. at 53. The opinion concluded that "if the President chooses to sign H.R. 
3792, he would be constitutionally authorized to decline to enforce" the constitutionally objectionable 
section. Id. at 38. 
4) Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16  
Op. O.L.C. 18 (1992) (preliminary print): This opinion concluded that two statutory provisions that 
limited the issuance of official and diplomatic passports were unconstitutional and were severable from 
the remainder of the two statutes. On the question of non-execution, the opinion rejected "the argument 
that the President may not treat a statute as invalid prior to a judicial determination." Id. at 40. The 
opinion concluded that the Constitution authorizes the President to refuse to enforce a law that he 
believes is unconstitutional. 
5) Memorandum for Bernard N. Nussbaum, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant 
Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Nov. 3, 1993): This opinion discusses different categories 
of signing statements, including those construing bills to avoid constitutional problems and those in 
which the President declares "that a provision of the bill before him is flatly unconstitutional, and that 
he will refuse to enforce it." Id. at 3. The opinion concludes that such "uses of Presidential signing 
statements generally serve legitimate and defensible purposes." Id. at 7. 
Presidential Signing Statements 
1) Statement by the State Department (Announcing President Wilson's Refusal to Carry Out the  
Section of the Jones Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, directing him to terminate treaty provisions 
restricting the Government's right to impose discriminatory tonnage dues and tariff duties), 17 A  
Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 8871 (Sept. 24, 1920) (Pres. Wilson): The 
State Department announced that it "has been informed by the President that he does not deem the 
direction contained in Section 34 of the so-called Merchant Marine Act an exercise of any 
constitutional power possessed by the Congress." Id. The statement also defended President Wilson's 
decision to sign the bill and noted that "the fact that one section of the law involves elements of 
illegality rendering the section inoperative need not affect the validity and operation of the Act as a 
whole." 5 Green Haywood Hackworth, Digest of International Law 324 (1943). 
2) Special Message to the Congress Upon Signing the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, Pub.  
Papers of Dwight D. Eisenhower 688 (July 13, 1955): President Eisenhower, in signing a bill (H.R. 
6042) that contained a legislative veto, stated that the legislative veto "will be regarded as invalid by 
the executive branch of the Government in the administration of H.R. 6042, unless otherwise 
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction." Id. at 689. -

Assistance Funds, Pub. Papers of John F. Kennedy 6 (Jan. 9, 1963): President Kennedy stated that a 
provision in the bill he was signing contained an unconstitutional legislative veto. He announced that 
"[i]t is therefore my intention . . . to treat this provision as a request for information." Id. 
4) Statement by the President Upon Approving the Public Works Appropriations Act, Pub. Papers of 
Lyndon B. Johnson 104 (Dec. 31, 1963): President Johnson also found that a legislative veto provision 
was unconstitutional and stated that he would treat it as a request for information. 
5) Statement About Signing the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972, Pub. Papers of Richard Nixon 
686 (June 17, 1972): President Nixon stated that a clause conditioning the use of authority by the 
executive branch on the approval of a congressional committee was unconstitutional. He ordered the 
agency involved to comply with "the acceptable procedures" in the bill "without regard to the 
unconstitutional provisions I have previously referred to." Id. at 687. 
6) Statement on Signing the Department of Defense Appropriation Act of 1976, Pub. Papers of Gerald  
R. Ford 241 (Feb. 10, 1976): President Ford stated that a committee approval mechanism was 
unconstitutional and announced that he would "treat the unconstitutional provision . . . to the extent it 
requires further Congressional committee approval, as a complete nullity." Id. at 242. 
7) Statement on Signing Coastal Zone Management Improvement Act of 1980, Pub. Papers of Jimmy  
Carter 2335 (Oct. 18, 1980): President Carter stated that a legislative veto provision was 
unconstitutional and that any attempt at a legislative veto would "not [be] regarded as legally binding." 
Id. 
8) Statement on Signing the Union Station Redevelopment Act of 1981, Pub. Papers of Ronald  
Reagan 1207 (Dec. 29, 1981): President Reagan stated that a legislative veto was unconstitutional and 
announced that "[t]he Secretary of Transportation will not . . . regard himself as legally bound by any 
such resolution." Id. 
9) Statement On Signing the National and Community Service Act of 1990, Pub. Papers of George  
Bush 1613 (Nov. 16, 1990): President Bush rejected the constitutionality of provisions that required a 
Presidentially appointed board exercising executive authority to include, among its 21 members, 
"seven members nominated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives . .. [and] seven members 
nominated by the Majority Leader of the Senate." Id. at 1614. He announced that the restrictions on his 
choice of nominees to the board "are without legal force or effect." Id. 
10) 7 A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 377 (Aug. 14, 1876) (Pres. Grant): 
This is one of the earliest of many instances of a President "construing" a provision (to avoid 
constitutional problems) in a way that seems to amount to a refusal to enforce a provision of it. An 
1876 statute directed that notices be sent to certain diplomatic and consular officers "to close their 
offices." President Grant, in signing the bill, stated that, "[i]n the literal sense of this direction it would 
be an invasion of the constitutional prerogatives and duty of the Executive." Id. In order to avoid this 
problem, President Grant "constru[edr this provision "only to exercise the constitutional prerogative of 
Congress over the expenditures of the Government," not to "imply[] a right in the legislative branch to 
direct the closing or discontinuing of any of the diplomatic or consular offices of the Government." Id. 
at 378. 
Other Presidential Documents 
1) A Presidential Legal Opinion, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1353 (1953): This was a legal opinion from 
President Franklin Roosevelt to Attorney General Jackson. President Roosevelt stated that he was 
signing the Lend-Lease Act despite a provision providing for a legislative veto, "a provision which, in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012391 
my opinion, is clearly unconstitutional." Id. at 1357. The President stated that, "[i]n order that I may be 
on record as indicating my opinion that the foregoing provision of the so-called Lend-Lease Act is 
unconstitutional, and in order that my approval of the bill, due to the existing exigencies of the world 
situation, may not be construed as a tacit acquiescence in any contrary view, I am requesting you to 
place this memorandum in the official files of the Department of Justice. I am desirous of having this 
done for the further reason that I should not wish my action in approving the bill which includes this 
invalid clause, to be used as a precedent for any future legislation comprising provisions of a similar 
nature." Id. at 1358. 
2) Message to the Congress on Legislative Vetoes, Pub. Papers of Jimmy Carter 1146 (Jun. 21, 1978): 
In this memorandum President Carter expressed his strong opposition to legislative vetoes and stated 
that "[t]he inclusion of [a legislative veto] in a bill will be an important factor in my decision to sign or 
to veto it." Id. at 1148. He further stated that, "[a]s for legislative vetoes over the execution of programs 
already prescribed in legislation and in bills I must sign for other reasons, the Executive Branch will 
generally treat them as 'report-and-wait' provisions. In such a case, if Congress subsequently adopts a 
resolution to veto an Executive action, we will give it serious consideration, but we will not, under our 
reading of the Constitution, consider it legally binding." Id. at 1149. 
Historical Materials 
1) Statement of James Wilson on December 1, 1787 on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution,  
reprinted in 2 Jonathan Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 418 (1836): Wilson argued that the 
Constitution imposed significant -- and sufficient -- restraints on the power of the legislature, and that 
the President would not be dependent upon the legislature. In this context, he stated that "the power of 
the Constitution was paramount to the power of the legislature acting under that Constitution; for it is 
possible that the legislature . . . may transgress the bounds assigned to it, and an act may pass, in the 
usual mode notwithstanding that transgression; but when it comes to be discussed before the judges,--
when they consider its principles, and find it to be incompatible with the superior power of the 
Constitution,-- it is their duty to pronounce it void . . . . In the same manner, the President of the United 
States could shield himself, and refuse to carry into effect an act that violates the Constitution." Id. at 
445-46. 
2) Letter from Chief Justice Chase to Gerrit Smith (Apr. 19, 1868), quoted in J. Schuckers, The Life  
and Public Services of Salmon Portland Chase 577 (1874): Chase stated that President Johnson took 
the proper action in removing Secretary of War Stanton without Senate approval, in light of Johnson's 
belief that the statutory restriction on his removal authority was unconstitutional. In this regard, Chase 
commented that "the President had a perfect right, and indeed was under the highest obligation, to 
remove Mr. Stanton, if he made the removal not in wanton disregard of a constitutional law, but with a 
sincere belief that the Tenure-of-Office Act was unconstitutional and for the purpose of bringing the 
question before the Supreme Court." Id. at 578. 
Congressional Materials 
1) The President's Suspension of the Competition in Contracting Act is Unconstitutional, H.R. Rep.  
No. 138, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. (1985): The House Committee on Government Operations concluded 
that the President lacked the authority to refuse to implement any provision of the Competition in 
Contracting Act. The Committee stated that, "fflo adopt the view that one's oath to support and defend 
the Constitution is a license to exercise any available power in furtherance of one's own constitutional 
interpretation would quickly destroy the entire constitutional scheme. Such a view, whereby the 
President pledges allegiance to the Constitution but then determines what the Constitution means, 
inexorably leads to the usurpation by the Executive of the others' roles." Id. at 11. The Committee also 
stated that "[t]he Executive's suspension of the law circumvents the constitutionally specified means 
for expressing Executive objections to law and is a constitutionally impermissible absolute veto 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012392 
power." Id. at 13. 
2) Memorandum from the Congressional Research Service to the Committee on Government 
Operations concerning "The Executive's Duty to Enforce the Laws" (Feb. 6, 1985), reprinted in 
Constitutionality of GAO's Bid Protest Function: Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm.  
on Government Operations, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 544 (1985): This memorandum stated that the 
President lacks the authority to decline to enforce statutes. The CRS argued that "[t]he refusal of the 
President to execute the law is indistinguishable from the power to suspend the laws. That power, as is 
true of the power to amend or to revive an expired law, is a legislative power." Id. at 554. 
Cases (not included in the submitted materials) 
1) Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926): The President refused to comply with -- that is, enforce 
-- a limitation on his power of removal that he regarded as unconstitutional, even though the question 
had not been addressed by the Supreme Court. A member of Congress, Senator Pepper, urged the 
Supreme Court to uphold the validity of the provision. The Supreme Court vindicated the President's 
interpretation without any member of the Court indicating that the President had acted unlawfully or 
inappropriately in refusing to enforce the removal restriction based on his belief that it was 
unconstitutional. 
2) United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946): The President enforced a statute that directed him to 
withhold compensation from three named employees, even though the President believed the law to be 
unconstitutional. The Justice Department argued against the constitutionality of the statute in the 
ensuing litigation. (The Court permitted an attorney to appear on behalf of Congress, amicus curiae, to 
defend the statute.) 
3) INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983): This case involved the withholding of citizenship from an 
applicant pursuant to a legislative veto of an Attorney General decision to grant citizenship. Despite a 
Carter Administration policy against complying with legislative vetoes (see Carter Presidential 
memorandum, supra), the executive branch enforced the legislative veto, and, in so doing, allowed for 
judicial review of the statute. As with Lovett, the Justice Department argued against the 
constitutionality of the statute. 
4) Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988): The President viewed the independent counsel statute as 
unconstitutional. The Attorney General enforced it, making findings and forwarding them to the 
Special Division. In litigation, however, the Justice Department attacked the constitutionality of the 
statute and left its defense to the Senate Counsel, as amicus curiae, and the independent counsel 
herself. 
5) Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991): A unanimous Court ruled that the appointment of 
special trial judges by the Chief Judge of the United States Tax Court did not violate the Appointments 
Clause. Five Justices concluded that the Tax Court was a "Court of Law" for Appointments Clause 
purposes, despite the fact that it was an Article I court, so that the Tax Court could constitutionally 
appoint inferior officers. Four Justices, in a concurrence by Justice Scalia, contended that the Tax Court 
was a "Department" under the Appointments Clause. The concurrence stated that "Court of Law" did 
not include Article I courts and that the Framers intended to prevent Congress from having the power 
both to create offices and to appoint officers. In this regard, the concurrence stated that "it was not 
enough simply to repose the power to execute the laws (or to appoint) in the President; it was also 
necessary to provide him with the means to resist legislative encroachment upon that power. The 
means selected were various, including a separate political constituency, to which he alone was 
responsible, and the power to veto encroaching laws, see Art. I, § 7, or even to disregard them when 
they are unconstitutional." Id. at 906 (Scalia, J., concurring). 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012393 
6) Lear Siegler, Inc., Energy Products Division v. Lehman, 842 F.2d 1102 (9th Cir. 1988), withdrawn  
in part 893 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc): The President refused to comply with provisions of the 
Competition in Contracting Act that he viewed as unconstitutional and thereby allowed for judicial 
resolution of the issue. The Ninth Circuit rejected the President's arguments about the constitutionality 
of the provisions. The court further determined that Lear Siegler was a prevailing party and was 
entitled to attorneys' fees, because the executive branch acted in bad faith in refusing to execute the 
contested provisions. In this regard, the court stated that the President's action was "utterly at odds with 
the texture and plain language of the Constitution," because a statute is part of the law of the land that 
the President is obligated to execute. Id. at 1121, 1124. On rehearing en banc, the court ruled that Lear 
Siegler was not a prevailing party and withdrew the sections of the opinion quoted above.

3 let me instruct you. Anything that 
4 you have learned through conversations between you 
Page 6 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012401 
-0929104.TXT 
5 and me are protected. So if you know any of that 
6 information outside of those discussions, you may 
7 answer. But if the only way you know it is 
8 through our discussions, do not answer that 
9 question. 
10 BY MR. TEIN: 
11 Q. you know that Mr. Leopold recently 
12 filed a lawsuit in federal court on your behalf against 
13 Jeffrey Epstein seeking fifty million dollars. 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
15 If you know the answer to that outside of 
16 our discussions, you may answer. If it is the 
17 only way that you know the answer is through our 
18 discussions, do not answer that question. 
19 THE WITNESS: Okay. 
20 MR. LEOPOLD: Attorney/client privilege. 
21 BY MR. TEIN: 
22 Q. You can answer the question unless 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
24 MR. TEIN: Let me finish. 
25 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. We're 
9 
1 MR. TEIN: No. Let me finish. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Lewis, we're not going to do 
3 that. 
4 MR. TEIN: My name is not Lewis. 
5 I'm going to finish my question. Okay? 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: Do not answer until you hear 
7 from me. 
8 BY MR. TEIN: 
Page 7 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012402 
-0929104.TXT 
9 Q. Other than conversations that you have had 
10 with Mr. Leopold -- I'm not asking about that -- are you 
11 aware that Mr. Leopold has filed a lawsuit in federal 
12 court seeking fifty million dollars from Jeffrey Epstein 
13 on your behalf? 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
15 Anything that you learn through 
16 conversations between you and me, do not answer. 
17 Those are protected. If you know through any 
18 other realm of knowledge, you may answer. 
19 THE WITNESS: No. 
20 BY MR. TEIN: 
21 Q. You have no idea that Mr. Leopold filed a 
22 fifty million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf against 
23 Jeffrey Epstein? 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
25 Do not answer that question if it's through 
10 
1 discussions that you and I had. Outside of that, 
2 you may answer. So do not answer that question if 
3 that is the only basis by which you understand 
4 that answer. 
5 THE WITNESS: No. 
6 BY MR. TEIN: 
7 Q. You didn't know that? 
8 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't answer that question. 
9 Against, it's attorney/client privilege. Any 
10 information you've learned through conversations 
11 between you and I are protected. If you know it 
12 through any other realm, you may answer. 
13 MR. TEIN: Are you going to say that for 
Page 8 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012403 
-0929104.TXT 
14 every question in the deposition, Mr. Leopold? 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: When you ask improper 
16 questions like that without the proper --
17 MR. TEIN: You're going to stop your 
18 speaking objections right now. Okay? 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Without the proper --
20 MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking 
21 objections. 
22 Let's continue. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, you just asked me a 
24 question and I'm going to state it on the 
25 record --
11 
1 MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking 
2 objections. Check your rules. 
3 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. For the record, 
4 Counsel asked me a question. I'll state the 
5 answer on the record. He asked me the question am 
6 I going to be answering that way throughout the 
7 deposition. So long as there's improper 
8 foundation and predicate asked by the attorney, I 
9 will protect my client and I make the record where 
10 appropriate. If counsel wishes to ask an 
11 appropriate worded question with the proper 
12 foundation and predicate, I will certainly allow 
13 the client to answer the question. 
14 MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you just state 
15 attorney/client privilege and just be done with 
16 it. 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: I want the record to be 
Page 9 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012404 
-0929104.TXT 
18 clear. 
19 MR. TEIN: You want to waste time is what 
20 you want to do. You were supposed to be here this 
21 morning and you totally broke the deal, the 
22 agreement that you had with us if your hearing got 
23 cancelled. 
24 But let's move on and maybe you'll stop 
25 obstructing this deposition. 
12 
1 MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very 
2 clear where we stand thus far. 
3 Is there a recording taken of this 
4 deposition? 
5 THE COURT REPORTER: Yes. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: Just make sure that's 
7 preserved. 
8 BY MR. TEIN: 
9 Q. Go to Exhibit 20-01 -- well, before you do 
10 that, , are you aware that a lawyer named Jeffrey 
11 Herman filed a lawsuit on your behalf, yes or no? 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. 
13 Any conversations that you and I have had 
14 regarding that, if that is the only way by which 
15 you understand how to answer that question, so not 
16 answer. It's attorney/client privilege, as well 
17 as any conversations you may have had with the 
18 attorney from Miami. That is also attorney/client 
19 privilege. And I'm assuming --
20 MR. TEIN: You're actually wrong about the 
21 attorney/client privilege. 
22 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm assuming Counsel is not 
Page 10 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012405 
-0929104.TXT 
23 asking you to divulge attorney/client --
24 MR. TEIN: Of course not. 
25 BY MR. TEIN:

4 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. 
5 MR. TEIN: We've heard the objection 10 
6 times already. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, excuse me. 
8 MR. TEIN: Just say attorney/client 
9 privilege. Stop interrupting my questions. 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm entitled to make an 
11 objection for the record, which I'm doing, and 
12 I'll make the same objection. And if it calls for 
13 attorney/client privilege, any conversations you 
14 and I have had, do not answer the question. 
15 And I think that it might be appropriate 
16 for the record to ask questions via 
17 as opposed to I think that would be more 
18 appropriate for this deposition. 
19 BY MR TEIN: 
20 Q. Go ahead. Please answer yes or no. 
21 la TOD 
22 Q. Thank you. 
23 In fact, you know that Mr. Herman held a 
24 press conference after he filed the fifty-million-dollar

2 Q. You know that he had press conference 
3 don't you, yes or no? 
4 A. ISI 
5 Q. In fact, let's go to Exhibit 20-01. 
6 MR. GOLDBERGER: Look behind you. You'll 
7 see it. 
8 BY MR. TEIN: 
9 Q. Have you ever seen that picture before? 
10 A. Yes. 
11 Q. Is that a picture of your father, your 
12 stepmother and Mr. Herman at the press conference 
13 regarding your lawsuit? 
14 A. Yes. 
15 Q. Now you know that this is a very serious 
16 matter, don't you? 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: Asked and answered. 
18 Objection. 
19 MR. GOLDBERGER: All right. You can 
20 object. You're representing a witness here, 
21 Mr. Leopold. You can object on privilege grounds. 
22 You cannot make legal objections. You have no 
23 standing to do so. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make them and 
25 then --
15 
1 MR. GOLDBERGER: We're --
2 MR. LEOPOLD: We're going to leave or we're 
3 going to take a break because his demeanor is not 
4 appropriate. There's no reason to have this kind

5 of demeanor. If you want to have this kind of 
6 demeanor with me 
7 MR. TEIN: You are obstructing this 
8 deposition. 
9 MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you guys go 
10 outside and just talk about --
11 MR. LEOPOLD: She -- her job is very 
12 difficult and she's not going to be able to take 
13 us both talking at he same time. 
14 MR. GOLDBERGER: Off the record. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: We're not going off the 
16 record, Jack. We're not, Jack. Her job is very 
17 difficult. I'm going to make the record. 
18 I don't think it is appropriate, especially 
19 in the small confines of this room, to be very 
20 aggressive with this young lady. 
21 MR. TEIN: That's not happening. Stop, 
22 stop actually --
23 MR. LEOPOLD: If you're going to interrupt 
24 me, we're going to cancel this deposition --
25 MR. TEIN: Stop misrepresenting. 
16 
1 THE COURT REPORTER: I need on at a time, 
2 no matter who it is. 
3 MR. LEOPOLD: I think we're going to take a 
4 break. Perhaps you might want to talk to your 
5 co-counsel --
6 MR. TEIN: I don't need to talk to him. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: But we're going to take a 
8 break.

10 witness needs a break. 
11 You're obstructing this deposition, Ted. 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: Come on, 
13 You all want to continue in this 
14 demeanor --
15 MR. TEIN: You're obstructing the 
16 deposition. Stop making speeches. We're not 
17 discussing this with you. The questions are to 
18 your client. Go take your five-minute break. 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Fine. We need to make sure 
20 the record's clear and clean. 
21 And I want to make sure as I've already 
22 asked you -- I know that you're one of the best in 
23 town -- that this audio -- this needs to be 
24 preserved. Okay? 
25 MR. TEIN: Go take your five-minute break, 
17 
1 Mr. Leopold, now. 
2 You were supposed to be here at nine a.m.; 
3 it's now after two. Take your break and come 
4 back. 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. If the demeanor keeps 
6 up, we will not be here beyond those five minutes.

14 MR. LEOPOLD: But I would suggest that you 
15 take deep breaths.

17 take a break.

8 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not asking questions.

10 because we don't have a video here today. 
11 MR. TEIN: These exhibits are part of the

5 MR. TEIN: You are improperly objecting, 
6 Mr. Leopold. You have no grounds to object. And 
7 that's not an objection. 
8 MR. LEOPOLD: It is an objection. 
9 MR. TEIN: Then terminate the deposition if 
10 you think it's been asked and answered. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded 
12 from just making an objection to the form of the 
13 question. As the courts well know, and if you 
14 practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the 
15 judges require you to set the objection with 
16 specificity. And I will do that. And if you 
17 don't want me to, you can make the record. But I 
18 will do that. 
19 MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You 
20 can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to 
21 form for every single one of my questions. 
22 Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: I won't do that.

4 BY MR. TEIN: 
5 Q. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm going to make the record. 
7 You cannot interrupt me when I'm making the 
8 record. Out of professional conduct, you cannot 
9 do that. I'm entitled to make the record. I made 
10 an objection, asked and answered. You demeanor is 
11 inappropriate. You're willing and you are able 
12 and you're responsible to ask a question in a 
13 professional manner and ask the question and once 
14 you get the answer, to either follow up on it or 
15 move on, but not continuously browbeat and ask the 
16 same question over and over because you don't like 
17 the answer. 
18 MR. TEIN: Calm down, sir. 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Trust me, I'm very calm here. 
20 When I'm not calm you'll know it. I'm very calm. 
21 So please continue on, but I will not allow 
22 you to continue to harass her in the demeanor that 
23 you're doing. Ask her a question and move on. 
24 MR. TEIN: Are you done?

6 MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very 
7 clear. 
8 MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me just clarify 
9 something. When you object to the form of a 
10 question, you're not instructing the witness not 
11 to answer the question, are you? 
12 MR. LEOPOLD: No. And I'm not making that 
13 objection: only on attorney/client privilege. 
14 MR. TEIN: Will you stop speaking now so I 
15 can ask my question? Are you done? 
16 Okay. I'm going to ask my question. 
17 BY MR. TEIN: 
18 Q. Listen, 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Hold on. Stop. 
20 I've been doing this for 20 plus years and 
21 have met a lot of attorneys, but I've never had an 
22 experience like this where I've --
23 MR. TEIN: Stop your speeches. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: If you continue to do this, 
25 whether its with me or with my client, I will not 
29 
1 put up with it and I don't need to put up with it 
2 and it's not appropriate. And I'm sure Mr. 
3 Goldberger knows all this, because I know that he 
4 wouldn't do this. So I will not put up with it.

21 Q. You gave your cell phone to whom? 
22 A. Michelle Pagan. 
23 Q. Did she keep it? 
24 A. Ask her. 
25 Q. You gave it to her and then you didn't get 
53 
1 it back at the end of the meeting? 
2 A. No. They -- yeah. No. They have it. I'm 
3 guessing. I don't have it. 
4 Q. How much money are you hoping to get out of 
5 Mr. Epstein? 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection to the form of the 
7 question. Attorney/client privilege. 
8 BY MR. TEIN: 
9 Q. How much money are you hoping to get, you, 
10 yourself, hoping to get out of Epstein? 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: Same. Same objection, 
12 attorney/client privilege. 
13 Don't answer the question. 
14 BY MR. TEIN: 
15 Q. I'm not asking about what your lawyer told 
16 you. 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm instructing her not to

18 answer the question, because any of those 
19 conversations involve her counsel.

22 ..................CERTIFIED QUESTION.................. 
23 BY MR. TEIN: 
24 Q. Now, Saige, you lied to get out of this 
25 deposition, didn't you? 
54 
1 A. No, sir. 
2 Q. You didn't want to come to court today and 
3 tell the story that you had told to the police under 
4 oath, did you? 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: Object to the form of the 
6 question. Lack of foundation, predicate. 
7 THE WITNESS: No. I have no problem coming 
8 here and talking to you. 
9 BY MR. TEIN: 
10 Q. And to avoid getting served with a lawful 
11 subpoena, you lied about your name, didn't you? 
12 A. No. 
13 Q. And in fact, just lying yourself wasn't 
14 enough, was it? 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Objects to the form of the 
16 question. 
17 Don't answer it. It's not a question.

1 ..................CERTIFIED QUESTION.................. 
2 BY MR. TEIN: 
3 Q. You asked your co-workers 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: It's vague and ambiguous. 
5 BY MR. TEIN: 
6 Q. You asked your co-workers at the 
7 to lie for you, didn't you? 
8 A. No. I informed my boss about what was 
9 going on and he told me that he would help in any way 
10 that he can. 
11 Q. Okay. You got your friend to lie 
12 by switching name tags with you, correct? 
13 A. Incorrect. It was a coincidence that same 
14 night she was not wearing her name tag; she was wearing 
15 mine. But I was also not wearing -- I was wearing my 
16 name tag. Everyone switches name tags. It just so 
17 happens it was a coincidence that same night the people 
18 came with the papers. 
19 MR. TEIN: Will you put up Exhibit 18-001? 
20 MR. GOLDBERGER: And mark 18-001 for 
21 identification purposes to this deposition. 
22 MR. LEOPOLD: None of them have been marked 
23 yet. Can we mark them and put them as attachment 
24 to the depositions? Because I think you've shown 
25 three photos now. And this is the only one that 
Page 47 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012442

56 
1 has been marked for identification yet. 
2 BY MR. TEIN: 
3 Q. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: Hold on just a second. Just 
5 so the record is clear --
6 MR. TEIN: I'm not speaking to you. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Then don't speak to me 
8 then. But I'll speak to Mr. Goldberger, perhaps. 
9 But at least for the record, can we put on 
10 the record what the previous two photographs were 
11 marked for identification? 
12 MR. GOLDBERGER: We will make sure that the 
13 record is clear at the end of the deposition so 
14 that there's no ambiguity. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Thank you. 
16 BY MR. TEIN: 
17 Q. I've put a photograph marked 18-001

her name tag, correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Your testimony under oath is that's just a 
coincidence, right? 
A. Total honesty. 
Q. It just happens to be the day that you were 
going to be served with a subpoena, correct?

7 Q. Now you can explain the answer that your 
8 counsel stopped you from explaining. 
Page 49 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012444 
-0929104.TXT 
9 A. Okay. I work at and people 
10 were telling me that people were looking for me. So yes, 
11 I was aware that people were searching for me, but I had 
12 no idea who they were or what their intentions were, but 
13 I thought they were just people I didn't want to talk to. 
14 So I just didn't want to talk to them. And every time 
15 they'd come to work I wasn't there. And so happens the 
16 night that they came in me and my friend switched name 
17 tags. No big deal. 
18 Q. That's a lie, isn't it? 
19 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Don't answer that 
20 question. That's harassment and I will not allow 
21 it. He could ask the questions and we'll allow a 
22 jury to make that determination, but not counsel. 
23 I will not allow her to answer that 
24 question. 
25 MR. TEIN: Certify it. 
59 
1 MR. LEOPOLD: I'll certify it. 
2 ..................CERTIFIED QUESTION.................. 
3 She's answered that question. She's explained it five 
4 times already. The fact that Counsel doesn't like the 
5 answer, that's a different query. 
6 MR. TEIN: Stop making speaking objections. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not. I'm not going to 
8 put up with it, because it's in appropriate, Jack, 
9 and you know it. I will not allow Counsel to 
10 berate a witness, whether it's in a criminal case 
11 or a civil case, whether my client or 
12 MR. TEIN: Calm down. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. 
Page 50 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012445 
-0929104.TXT 
14 No, I'm not going to allow it. That is not 
15 proper. 
16 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. 
17 MR. LEOPOLD: If he wants to say that she's 
18 lying after asking it five times and her 
19 explaining in great detail, he can do that. But 
20 I'm not going to allow her to answer, nor be 
21 harassed by him. It's improper. 
22 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. But your response 
23 that Counsel doesn't like the question -- or 
24 doesn't like the answer -- just let me finish. 
25 MR. LEOPOLD: Absolutely. I wasn't going 
60 
1 to interrupt you. 
2 MR. GOLDBERGER: Just requires us to say we 
3 like the answer to that question. And it's not 
4 you and t or you and Mr. Tein who are testifying 
5 here. It's the witness. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: Fine. But after the sixth 
7 time of asking the same question and then coming 
8 back and pointing a finger at her and saying, 
9 you're a liar --
10 MR. TEIN: That didn't happen. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. But I'm not 
12 going to allow her to answer that question because 
13 she's answered that same question and has 
14 explained it. 
15 Now Counsel might be sitting there rubbing 
16 his head with a migraine. That's his problem. 
17 But if he can't ask a question appropriately in a 
Page 51 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012446 
-0929104.TXT 
18 professional manner, we will leave. I will not 
19 allow her to be berated like that. 
20 MR. GOLDBERGER: Actually, we're very happy 
21 with the answer. 
22 MR. LEOPOLD: That's great. 
23 MR. GOLDBERGER: Do you want us to get into 
24 that? 
25 MR. TEIN: Ted --
61 
1 MR. LEOPOLD: This is really big stuff that 
2 you're going through, but that's fine; just ask 
3 your question and move on. But do it one time. 
4 If you don't understand it, I'll let you follow 
5 up, but I'm not going to allow you to ask the same 
6 question the time and again and then call her a 
7 liar. Just ask the question, get the answer and 
8 move to the next subject matter. 
9 MR. TEIN: Ted, I'm sitting right across 
10 the table from you. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: Yes, sir. 
12 MR. TEIN: Please be quiet. Don't yell. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: I will not be quiet. 
14 MR. TEIN: Stop yelling. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Lewis, when I'm yelling 
16 you'll know it. I will not --
17 MR. TEIN: My name is not Lewis. 
18 MR. LEOPOLD: I thought your first name was 
19 Lewis, Mr. Tein. 
20 MR. TEIN: You watched me for three days at 
21 the evidentiary hearing where you sat in the back 
22 of the courtroom. You should know who I am. 
Page 52 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012447 
-0929104.TXT 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: Well, that's the impression 
24 you must have made in the courtroom. 
25 I will not be quiet. 
62 
1 MR. TEIN: That's obnoxious. Stop being 
2 obnoxious. It's stupid. Let's go ahead with the 
3 questions. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: I will make the record.

16 restaurant so that they could serve you?

25 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't guess.

87 
1 speech and then we'll ask the questions. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Well, you won't let me finish 
3 making the objection, so it's difficult to do 
4 that. But if you want to follow with an 
5 appropriate question, feel free to do that. But 
6 we're not going to harass the witness. 
7 MR. TEIN: I disagree with everything

11 Q. Sounds about right? 
12 A. Sure. 
13 Q. And the reason he threw her out of the 
14 house was because she was lying, too? 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Lack of 
16 foundation. Calls for speculation. 
17 BY MR. TEIN:

19 correct, right? 
20 A. I've never been coached. 
21 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. 
22 BY MR. TEIN: 
23 Q. Okay. When your counsel that it was there 
24 was lack of foundation, you agree with your counsel, 
25 right? 
115 
1 A. I was like saying, Yeah, let's move on, 
2 because there was no point to asking that question. 
3 Q. Your father threw out of the house 
4 because she was lying, correct? 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Lack of 
6 foundation. 
7 Hold on, Let me just make the 
8 objection. 
9 Lack of foundation, predicate, calls for 
10 speculation.

20 A. Yes. 
21 Q. Now your parents are also lying, aren't 
22 they? 
23 A. Yes. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: Just so the record is clear, 
25 the father -- because the mother was up north. 
116 
1 MR. TEIN: Don't testify, Counsel. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: So the record is clear, the 
3 father -- the mother was --
4 MR. TEIN: Counsel, don't coach and 
5 testify, please. That's absolutely improper. 
6 MR. LEOPOLD: You just asked the wrong 
7 question. 
8 MR. TEIN: You can't coach her that way and 
9 you well know it. 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: For the record, it's the 
11 father. He's remarried, I think on his third 
12 marriage. 
13 MR. TEIN: You cannot -- it's absolutely, 
14 totally against the rules and you know it. 
15 MR LEOPOLD: The natural mother lives in 
16 Georgia.

19 MR LEOPOLD: The natural mother lives in 
20 Georgia. The father is here locally. 
21 MR TEIN: Stop coaching. Stop talking. 
22 You object. You know the rules. You just 
23 lectured me about the rules, Counsel. So why 
24 don't you play by the rules. Or only when they 
25 fit you? Why don't you grandstand a little more 
117 
1 now. Give us a five-minute speech, Mr. Leopold. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Are you finished, for the

13 are also liars. 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't answer the question. 
15 We're not going to answer until I make the record. 
16 I want to put on the record, now that Counsel 
17 appears to be finished with his comments for the 
18 record, that the previous question was 
19 inappropriate, was intentionally misleading. 
20 Now you can ask the question.

Page 100

16 Q. Well, you know that your mother filed a 
17 statement, an affidavit, saying that you don't trust your 
18 father and that you believe he's trying to manipulate you 
19 for his own gain; isn't that correct? 
20 A. Correct. 
21 Q. You agree with that statement, don't you? 
22 A. Uh-huh. Yes. 
23 Q. Do you trust your stepmother? 
24 A. My stepmother, no. 
25 Q. You think she's also trying to steal your 
120 
1 Epstein lawsuit money away from you, don't you? 
2 A. I would like to clarify something. You 
3 keep saying my Epstein lawsuit money. I don't have any 
4 money, and it's just a lawsuit at the moment. So I just 
Page 102 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012497 
-0929104.TXT 
5 don't trust her. 
6 Q. Okay. You think that your stepmother is 
7 trying to take advantage of this lawsuit to try to get 
8 money from Mr. Epstein that belongs to you, right? 
9 A. Yes. 
10 Q. Did your stepmother tell you why she was 
11 arrested?

Did your stepmother tell you that she's 
14 ever been arrested?

6 A. No. 
7 Q. Ever in your life, have you exchanged sex

9 A. No. 
10 MR. TEIN: We're done.

12 MR. LEOPOLD: We'll read. 
13 MS. BELOHLAVEK: I don't have any 
Page 104 
122 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012499 
-0929104.TXT 
14 questions. Thank you. 
15 MR. LEOPOLD: Before we go off the record, 
16 it's my understanding -- Mr. Goldberger can 
17 correct the record, but we have stipulated that 
18 color copies of the documents that were identified 
19 for identification certainly will be attached to 
20 the deposition and counsel will be taking the 
21 photographs across street so that they can be 
22 laser color copied so that we have a copy, and I'm 
23 assuming he'll get a copy to the court reporter, 
24 too, to attach, actually a certified copy to the 
25 deposition. 
123 
1 MR. GOLDBERGER: Done. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that. 
3 If not, then I want to pull each one out and put 
4 exhibit labels on them, which we should do before 
5 we leave. 
6 MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do 
7 either. I'll have copies sent to the court 
8 reporter and she can attach them to the 
9 deposition. 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree 
11 to what we talked about during the break then. 
12 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what 
13 your asking me to do. Let me finish. 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine. 
15 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to 
16 go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies 
17 and then I'll give those to the court reporter, 
Page 105 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012500 
-0929104.TXT 
18 fine. All I'm saying is that I would avoid that 
19 process. I would send copies to the court 
20 reporter. But if it will make you happier 
21 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not? 
22 MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me finish. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not interrupting now. 
24 MR. GOLDBERGER: But if it will make you 
25 happier if I go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office 
124 
1 and make a copy of those photos that were part of 
2 this deposition and then I'll give them to the 
3 court reporter, I'll be happy to do it. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: I trust you implicitly, 
5 however you with to do it. However, the 
6 documents, before they leave this room, need to 
7 have an exhibit sticky on them with the 
8 appropriate --
9 MR. GOLDBERGER: Want to go get some? We 
10 don't have any. 
11 MR. LEOPOLD: I will do that. Excuse me. 
12 Let me finish the record, please. You can't do 
13 that to the court reporter. She's going to stroke 
14 out. You can't do that. You have to let me --
15 MR. TEIN: Finish your sentence, Ted. You 
16 are the most long-winded lawyer I've ever seen in 
17 my life. Finish your sentence. 
18 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, tell him not to raise 
19 his voice, please. 
20 MR. TEIN: Finish your sentence. Is there 
21 going to be a period at the end of the sentence or 
22 is it just going to be comma after comma after 
Page 106 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012501 
-0929104.TXT 
23 comma? 
24 Go ahead, lawyer. 
25 MR. LEOPOLD: All right. The exhibits, I 
125 
1 can't prevent you from taking them, but I will 
2 object and I will be bringing it to the court for 
3 sanctions. You cannot take the exhibits out of 
4 the room without them being marked. I want them 
5 marked, because you cannot identify in the record 
6 what was used. And with all due respect to 
7 Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this 
8 deposition is going, I do not want to rely on 
9 Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate 
10 exhibits. I will not do that. I cannot prevent 
11 you from taking them. But if you do, I will be 
12 bringing the matter to the court with appropriate 
13 sanctions, because that is improper. That is 
14 improper. When you use something in a deposition, 
15 they are to be marked. And you have refused to do 
16 that throughout for what ever reason. 
17 MR TEIN: You're wrong. Finish your 
18 sentence because you're talking about something 
19 you have no idea. 
20 Every single one is marked, Ted. Every 
21 single one is already marked. But you want to 
22 argue about everything. Ever single one is 
23 already marked. Isn't that silly, Ted? 
24 MR. GOLDBERGER: Thirty years of doing this 
25 and I have never had an argument over this. 
Page 107 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012502 
-0929104.TXT 
126 
1 MR. TEIN: You've made -- Ted, you are 
2 obstructionist, you are a liar. You have lied and 
3 misrepresented things, for the record. You are 
4 grandstanding. 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: You need to back up. 
6 MR. TEIN: No, no. I'm going to finish. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: You can finish, but don't 
8 hover over me. 
9 MR. TEIN: No one is hovering over you. 
10 Stop trying to make a lying record. 
11 Let me say something else. 
12 Don't you dare threaten me with sanctions, 
13 after you lied in a letter to my co-counsel about 
14 the fact -- be quiet. Be quiet and let me finish. 
15 You lied in a letter to my co-counsel, 
16 Mr. Leopold, in which you said -- it was a 
17 complete and utter lie -- that you were 
18 unavailable this morning because you had a 
19 hearing. That was a lie. I have never seen each 
20 lawyer deign to do something like that. 
21 So you will get the ex -- be quiet Let me 
22 finish. You behave. 
23 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at 
24 me. 
25 MR. TEIN: Listen. Be quiet and I won't 
127 
1 have a need to point it at you. 
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at 
3 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold --
4 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at 
Page 108 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012503 
-0929104.TXT 
5 me. 
6 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold, let me finish. 
7 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't raise your voice 
8 either. 
9 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold 
10 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, do you want to take 
11 care of this? 
12 MR. TEIN: Let me finish my sentence. The 
13 exhibits are marked. We are walking out of here. 
14 You are someone who misrepresents the 
15 record. It is absolutely atrocious what you do. 
16 That is not how a lawyer should behave. This 
17 deposition is over. You will get your exhibits, 
18 Mr. Leopold. 
19 MR. GOLDBERGER: I understand what you're 
20 saying, Michael, and I understand Ted's position. 
21 Just so there's -- we're going to have lots 
22 offer issues in this case. We're going to have 
23 lots of reasons to disagree. 
24 I'm going to take it over now and I'm going 
25 to make copies and I'm going to give them to 
128 
1 Ms. Consor. If you want to go find some exhibit 
2 labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my 
3 guest. But that's what I'm offering to do. 
4 THE WITNESS: Let me say two things, 
5 because I am happy to always disagree and with 
6 you, I have no problem; we could always do it 
7 professionally. 
8 I want to say two things so the record is 
Page 109 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012504 
-0929104.TXT 
9 very clear. Since for whatever reason I have not 
10 been able to look at exhibits because they have 
11 been refused to have been shown to me --
12 MR. TEIN: That's a lie. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, if you represent that 
14 the documents have the appropriate exhibit numbers 
15 or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000, whatever 
16 they may be, then you can take them, make copies, 
17 send me a copy, make sure the court reporter gets 
18 a copy and then send me a bill for my copy, that's 
19 fine. I didn't know that they are marked that way 
20 because I haven't been able to look at them. 
21 MR. GOLDBERGER: They are barcoded and the 
22 number that we've made reference to in the 
23 deposition coincides with the barcoding. 
24 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. Eight by eleven 
25 color laser copies are fine. 
129 
1 MS. BELOHLAVEK: The State Attorneys Office 
2 is not going to charge anybody for color copies I 
3 print out. 
4 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine He's going to 
5 take them back to his office . 
6 Secondly -- and I will be more than happy 
7 to do it, because it sounds like you all know more 
8 about it than I, but I'm happy to get affidavits 
9 from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about 
10 what happened with this hearing today, because I 
11 
12 
13 
know very little about it. But my representations 
are what they are. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: They stay --
Page 110 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012505 
-0929104.TXT 
14 MR. LEOPOLD: Let me just finish for the 
15 record. 
16 Representations or comments about what 
17 happened, representation about this hearing this 
18 morning, I know very little about it. I --
19 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word on 
20 that. 
21 MR. LEOPOLD: No, no, no. I just put it on 
22 the record. I will get an affidavit -- I'm 
23 assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. 
24 Pincus. I have no clue about what happened and 
25 why it was canceled. All I was told when I was 
130 
1 out of town yesterday was that the hearing this 
2 morning was cancelled. 
3 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word for 
4 it. 
5 MR. LEOPOLD: If you want an affidavit, 
6 I'll get it for you. 
7 MR. GOLDBERGER: It's a personal issue for 
8 me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it 
9 was done just because it wasn't convenient for 
10 you, then I'm offended by that. But if you're 
11 telling me that it was planned and it didn't 
12 happen, I'll take your word for it. 
13 MR. LEOPOLD: I am more than happy to get 
14 you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason 
15 why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm 
16 assuming since my deposition was taken for four 
17 hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing 
Page 111 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012506 
-0929104.TXT 
18 today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am 
19 told it is being re-noticed. Why it was canceled 
20 I have no idea, but if your co-counsel wishes an 
21 affidavit to that effect from Mr. Pincus, I'm more 
22 than happy to get it. But I don't know the reason 
23 why it was canceled. 
24 MR. TEIN: I don't need it. But what I do 
25 take issue with is regardless of why it was 
131 
1 canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, you 
2 know what? We can start earlier this morning. 
3 MR. LEOPOLD: I owe you nothing 
4 MR. TEIN: I don't care. Don't interrupt 
5 me. 
6 Because Jack canceled his vacation plans 
7 because of you. 
8 MR. GOLDBERGER: That's all right, that's 
9 all right. 
10 MR. TEIN: And you're selfish. And this 
11 deposition is over. Good-by Mr. Leopold. 
12 MR. GOLDBERGER: You can go off the record.

A. Twenty-one. 
Q. Very good. 
What we're going to do today is we're going 
to take what's know as a sworn statement from you. And 
my court reporter just put you under oath. So all I want 
you to do is tell the absolute truth today. 
7 A. Right. 
8 Q. I don't want you to color what you're 
9 saying in any way. Really, the only thing that will be 
10 of any use to anyone is if you just tell the absolute 
11 truth. 
12 A. Right. 
13 Q. So those are the instructions, okay? 
14 A. Okay. 
15 Q. All right. And sometimes -- I've been 
16 doing this for a lot of years and sometimes I talk like a 
17 lawyer too much, and if you don't understand what I'm --
18 A. That's your job. 
19 Q. I guess. But if you don't understand what 
20 I'm saying at some point, just say, "Jack, say it in 
21 English," and I'll make it better for you. Okay? 
22 A. Okay. 
23 Q. So tell me how you first met Jeffrey 
24 Epstein.

18 talking to you in person. In other words, she said --
19 you saw her somewhere, be it at the store that you worked 
20 at or around the neighborhood, she said to you in person, 
21 "Do you want to go over to Jeffrey Epstein's house?"

15 Q. -- maybe another time you would get a phone 
16 call, "Do you want to come over and give a massage," and

19 been some touching, correct? 
20 A. Right. 
21 Q. And then the next time you could go over 
22 there and it could have been a regular massage again, 
23 right? 
24 A. Uh-huh. 
25 Q. Okay. So the point that I guess I'm trying

3 and give a massage," and you just assumed it would be to 
4 go have sex? That was not the case? 
5 A. No. 
6 Q. Never, never, never, right? 
7 A. Yes. 
8 Q. All right. There were times when you would 
9 be away and not be in Palm Beach and -- I mean you very 
10 much thought that Jeffrey was your friend? You treated 
11 him as a friend? 
12 A. Yes, definitely. I felt that he was my 
13 friend. 
14 Q. And there were times when maybe you were 
15 out of town and for whatever reason, you found yourself 
16 in a situation where you needed some money, correct? 
17 A. Yes. 
18 Q. Okay. And you felt that the relationship 
19 was such that you could call Jeffrey and it never had 
20 anything to do with a massage or anything. You would 
21 say, "Listen, I could use a couple of dollars. I have a 
22 problem." 
23 A. Yes. 
24 Q. And would he ever hesitate to help you out?

to make was that there were never phone calls that would 
come to you and they would say, "Do you want to come over

2 listen -- he would talk to you about life and about --
3 A. Yes. 
4 Q. -- about what you wanted to do with your 
5 life? 
6 A. Yes. 
7 Q. And he said, "If you ever find yourself in 
8 trouble, you have a friend in me and you can give me a 
9 call"? 
10 A. Yes. 
11 Q. Okay. If you had to guess -- and 
12 recognizing that there can be no accuracy here -- if you 
13 had to guess, how many times do you think you went over 
14 to Jeffrey's house? 
15 A. I would say at least five, less than ten. 
16 Q. Okay. I think that's kind of a fair range. 
17 And during those five to ten times that you 
18 went there, was there ever anything uncomfortable, in 
19 your mind, that occurred over at Jeffrey's house? 
20 A. No. 
21 Q. Okay. I know we've touched on this, but 
22 just Lilly, the detail person, makes sure that we get 
23 everything. After you met Jeffrey the first time did you 
24 ever talk to him on the telephone about arranging a 
25 massage or anything like that? 
Q. 
And in fact, did he not tell you that, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012534 
sor & Associates 
TriLcd$, 
Page 21 
1 A. No. 
2 Q. Okay. And you never e-mailed him or 
3 anything like that? 
4 A. No, no. 
5 Q. Never text-messaged him? 
6 A. No. 
7 Q. Okay. Now at times when you would go over 
8 zo give a massage, Jeffrey, while he was getting the 
9 massage, would be preoccupied doing a lot of things, 
10 right? 
11 A. Yes, very often. 
12 Q. He was a busy guy? 
13 A. Yes. 
14 Q. He would be on the telephone talking Lo 
15 folks while you were giving a massage? 
16 A. Yes. Sometimes it would be just a massage 
17 and he'd be pretty much doing business the whole time. 
18 Q. Right. Certainly it wasn't sex or anything 
19 like that? 
20 A. No. 
21 Q. He would be doing business and you'd be 
22 massaging him? 
23 A. Yes. 
24 Q. Okay. Give me one second.

Sworn Statement taken before Maria Powers, 
Court Reporter and Notary Public in and for the State 
of Florida at Large, in the above cause. 
Thereupon, 
having been first duly sworn, was examined and 
testified as follows: 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 
as you remember, my name is Jack 
Goldberger. I think we met last Friday, actually. 
You voluntarily came in and gave a sworn 
statement to me concerning your knowledge and your 
friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. 
I would like to very, very, briefly continue 
that statement today, and just focus on one area that 
we forgot to question you about last Friday. 
All I want you to tell me is the absolute 
truth here this evening. There's no right answer, 
other than the truth, okay? 
A Right. 
I haven't promised you or asked you to do 
anything, one way or the other, have I? 
A No.

1 Q So, we covered a lot of ground last time. 
2 One area that I didn't ask you about is 
3 contact that you've had with either the FBI or the U.S. 
4 Attorney's Office, within the last two or three years. 
5 Can you guess or estimate how many times 
6 someone from the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office or 
7 some other law enforcement agency, has attempted to 
8 contact you in the last couple of years? 
9 A I'd have to say -- well, maybe five or six 
10 meetings with, and more than that with phone contact. 
11 
Let's try to break it down by meetings and 
12 phone contacts. I think that would be the best way to 
13 do it. 
14 Of the actual meetings that you've had with 
15 someone from law enforcement or from the U.S. 
16 Attorney's Office, who do you remember being present at 
17 those meetings? 
18 A Nesbith was at all of them. 
19 Q When we're talking about "Nesbith" we're 
20 talking about an FBI agent by the name of "Nesbith 
21 Kurkendall"? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And Nesbith was present at all those 
24 meetings? 
25 A Yes.

2 A The first one was a guy, I'm not sure of his 
3 name. And then there's another one that had -- another 
4 lady with the victim's rights. 
5 Q She was victim's right representative? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q We talked about a lawyer by the name "Marie 
8 Villafona;" do you know whether she was present during 
9 any of those meetings? 
10 A I'm not sure of the name. 
11 Q The first time that you met with Nesbith, 
12 where did that take place? 
13 A Here, in my backyard. 
14 0 In your backyard, at your home in Western 
15 Palm Beach County, right? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Did she announce to you that she was coming, 
18 or did she just show up? 
19 A She showed up. 
20 Q Unannounced? 
21 A Yes. 
22 Q During that time, I assume that you told her 
23 about your relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and any 
24 contact you've had with him, correct? 
Q Okay, go ahead. 
25 A Correct.

1 Q Did she tell you anything about whether you 
2 were a victim in this case, or anything like that, at 
3 that meeting? 
4 A Yes, she said I was a victim/witness in this, 
5 and that there's victim rights that I'm entitled to, 
6 which include counseling and whatnot. 
7 Q Did you tell her, at that time, that you 
8 didn't feel that you were a victim at all, and that 
9 anything that you've done with Jeffrey Epstein was 
10 totally voluntary? 
11 A Yeah, I did tell her that everything was, you 
12 know, consensual with everything, and I don't agree 
13 with anything that's going on. 
14 Q Did she try and pressure you into being a 
15 victim in this thing, when you were not a victim? 
16 A I wouldn't say that she pressured me, but she 
17 tried to be as convincing as possible. 
18 Q Maybe the use of the word "pressure" is too 
19 strong. But she was trying to change your opinion of 
20 what the relationship was with Jeffrey? 
21 A Yes, she was trying to make me feel bad about 
22 it, in a way, about what was going on. 
23 Q And you didn't feel bad about it, you felt 
24 everything was okay, but she was trying to make you 
25 feel bad, like something wrong had occurred?

1 A Yeah. 
2 Q How long did that meeting go on for? 
3 A Probably about -- at least an hour. 
4 Q When was the next time that you had contact 
5 with Nesbith or someone else from law enforcement? 
6 A I'm not sure, probably a month or later. I 
7 mean, she probably called me and let me know that she 
8 was going to -- you know, she wanted to meet sometime 
9 soon, to deliver the victim's rights papers to me. 
10 Q So there was a time, after you first met, 
11 where, despite the fact that you said, I don't consider 
12 myself a victim in this, she called you and said, I 
13 want to bring you some paperwork that talks about your 
14 victim's rights? 
15 A Yes. 
16 Q What was your response to her when she told 
17 you that? 
18 A I told her I would meet with her, 'cause she 
19 wanted me to meet with the other woman involved. And 
20 they gave them to me. 
21 I took them, but I never really told them I 
22 needed counseling or anything like that. 
23 Q Where did that meeting take place? 
24 A I believe it was Panera Bread in 
25 Wellington.

She actually came and sought you out at a 
2 restaurant? 
3 A Well, I told her to meet me there. 
4 Q Were you working there or were you just --
5 A No, I was just there. 
6 Q So she called you and said, I really, really 
7 want to see you. And you said, if you want to see me, 
8 meet me at Panera Bread? 
9 A Yes. 
10 Q Did you feel if you didn't meet her, she 
11 wasn't going to go away, that you had to deal with 
12 her? 
13 A Well, I mean, it wasn't particularly that. I 
14 knew that she was going to contact me because of this 
15 case. Because, whether I want to be involved or not, I 
16 have to be. 
17 Q Okay. That's two meetings that I know of. I 
18 think you indicated that, if you had to guess, there 
19 were maybe a total of five meetings. 
20 Are there other meetings that we haven't 
21 talked about that occurred? 
22 A Yeah, but they were very vague They weren't 
23 anything of importance. And, I mean, it was just 
24 her -- or of importance to me, anyway. 
25 Q Would she call you and say, listen, I really,

1 really, want to talk to you about being a victim or --
2 
A It wasn't always directly about being a 
3 victim. And, every-time we talked, she would always 
4 touch upon the fact that if I need any help or 
5 so-on-and-so-forth, because I am a victim in this 
6 case. 
7 Q I assume, based on what you're telling me, 
8 you continued to tell her, I'm not a victim? 
9 A I just let her say what she said. I never 
10 got counseling. But she knows from the beginning, and, 
11 I continued to reassure her, that I don't feel that 
12 way. 
13 Q So, the first time you met with her, when you 
14 spent about an hour with her and you went through all 
15 your contact with Jeffrey, that's what occurred at that 
16 meeting, and she talked to you about being a victim at 
17 that meeting? 
18 A Yes. 
19 Q And then there was this second meeting, where 
20 she brought a victim's rights person with her, and that 
21 took place at Panera Bread, right? 
22 
A Yes. 
23 Q And you had the same response, listen, you 
24 think I'm a victim. You could give me the information, 
25 but I don't need that information, right?

A Right, pretty much. 
And then there were some other contacts. 
Would she call you and want to talk to you 
4 about the specific facts about the case? I mean, why 
5 would she contact --
6 A Yeah, I mean, just to re-question me about 
7 certain things, because she wasn't sure that the 
8 answers were --
9 
Were those in-person meetings? 
10 A I mean, a lot of them were on the phone. I 
11 mean, it wasn't very often that we would meet. 
12 Q Was there any other time that you did meet? 
13 We talked about two times that you actually 
14 did meet, once here at your home and once at Panera 
15 Bread. 
16 Were there any other actual meetings, or did 
17 the others occur on the phone? 
18 A There were other meetings, but they were, 
19 like I said, not really important. 
20 Q Do you remember where they were that they 
21 took place? 
22 A They came to my job, I think, two times.

5 about more facts of the case? 
6 A Ah-huh. 
7 Q And, during that meeting, she also talked to 
8 you about your rights as a victim again? 
9 A Yeah, she always reassured me of my rights as 
10 a victim. 
11 Q Then there would have been a fourth time 
12 we're talking about now, where there were investigators 
13 from Washington coming down, concerning David 
14 Copperfield, and Nesbith introduced them to you, 
15 correct? 
16 A Right. 
17 Q I take it what you're telling me is that 
18 Nesbith seized the opportunity to talk to you again 
19 about being a victim, right? 
20 A She always kind of comes out as asking if I'm 
21 okay, and if everything okay. And if I ever need any 
22 kind of help or anything, with -- you know, I could 
23 always have help. 
24 Q Did you continue to say, listen, I'm fine, 
25 there's no issues here?

A I just -- I mean, I was never pushy on it. I 
2 just, like I said, she always knows. 
3 I may not tell her every time, but she always 
4 knows how I feel about this case. 
5 Q Meaning? 
6 A I don't need any-thing. 
7 Q Meaning that you made it really clear to her 
8 that you didn't need any help?

11 very happy.

I am writing not to respond to your asserted "policy concerns" regarding Mr. Epstein's Non-
Prosecution Agreement, which will be addressed by the United States Attorney, but the time has 
come for me to respond to the ever-increasing attacks on my role in the investigation and 
negotiations. 
It is an understatement to say that I am surprised by your allegations regarding my role 
because I thought that we had worked very well together in resolving this dispute. I also am 
surprised because I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect that the agreement 
would have on Mr. Epstein and to make sure that you (and he) understood the repercussions of the 
agreement. For example, I brought to your attention that one potential plea could result in no gain 
time for your client; I corrected one of your calculations of the Sentencing Guidelines that would 
have resulted in Mr. Epstein spending far more time in prison than you projected; I contacted the 
Bureau of Prisons to see whether Mr. Epstein would be eligible for the prison camp that you desired; 
and I told you my suspicions about the source of the press "leak" and suggested ways to avoid the 
press. Importantly, I continued to work with you in a professional manner even after I learned that 
you had been proceeding in bad faith for several weeks — thinking that I had incorrectly concluded 
that solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution was a registrable offense and that you would 
"fool" our Office into letting Mr. Epstein plead to a non-registrable offense. Even now, when it is 
clear that neither you nor your client ever intended to abide by the terms of the agreement that he 
signed, I have never alleged misconduct on your part. 
The first allegation that you raise is that I "assiduously" hid from you the fact that Bert 
Ocariz is a friend of my boyfriend and that I have a "longstanding relationship" with Mr. Ocariz.

I informed you that I selected Mr. Ocariz because he was a friend and classmate of two people 
whom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr. Ocariz prior to contacting him about 
this case. All of those facts are true. I still have never met Mr. Ocariz, and, at the time that he and 
I spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship with his friend. You suggest that I 
should have explicitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my "boyfriend" rather than 
simply a "friend," which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to discuss my personal 
relationships with opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted 
to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of 
intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. Ocariz 
was that person. 
One of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr. Ocariz and my boyfriend. 
This is patently untrue and neither my boyfriend nor I would have received any financial benefit 
from Mr. Ocariz's appointment. Furthermore, after Mr. Ocariz learned more about Mr. Epstein's 
actions (as described below), he expressed a willingness to handle the case pro bono, with no 
financial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, 
including the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by Judge Davis. You rejected those other 
options. 
You also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. Ocariz. I 
provided Mr. Ocariz with a bare bones summary of the agreement's terms related to his appointment 
to help him decide whether the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. 
I did not provide Mr. Ocariz with facts related to the investigation because they were confidential 
and instead recommended that he "Google" Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When 
Mr. Ocariz asked for additional information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I 
forwarded those questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any 
further information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. Ocariz had been told that you 
concurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I informed Mr. Ocariz of the Office's 
decision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the Office had made contact 
with Judge Davis. We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with 
Judge Davis. I understand from you that Mr. Ocariz contacted Judge Davis. You criticize his 
decision to do so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were entitled to contact Judge Davis to 
try to "lobby" him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. 
Another reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the 
Section 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of "facilitator" to convince 
the victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone 
and that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that 
doing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation. 
Much of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective Recarey's investigation that have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012578 
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 13, 2007 
PAGE 3 OF 5 
already been submitted to the Office on several occasions and you suggest that I have kept that 
information from those who reviewed the proposed indictment package. Contrary to your 
suggestion, those submissions were attached to and incorporated in the proposed indictment 
package, so your suggestion that I tried to hide something from the reviewers is false. I also take 
issue with the duplicity of stating that we must accept as true those parts of the Recarey reports and 
witness statements that you like and we must accept as false those parts that you do not like. You 
and your co-counsel also impressed upon me from the beginning the need to undertake an 
independent investigation. It seems inappropriate now to complain because our independent 
investigation uncovered facts that are unfavorable to your client. 
You complain that I "forced" your client and the State Attorney's Office to proceed on 
charges that they do not believe in, yet you do not want our Office to inform the State Attorney's 
Office of facts that support the additional charge nor do you want any of the victims of that charge 
to contact Ms. Belohlavek or the Court. Ms. Belohlavek's opinion may change if she knows the full 
scope of your client's actions. You and I spent several weeks trying to identify and put together a 
plea to federal charges that your client was willing to accept. Yet your letter now accuses me of 
"manufacturing" charges of obstruction of justice, making obscene phone calls, and violating child 
privacy laws. When Mr. Lourie told you that those charges would "embarrass the Office," he meant 
that the Office was unwilling to bend the facts to satisfy Mr. Epstein's desired prison sentence — a 
statement with which I agree. 
I hope that you understand how your accusations that I imposed "ultimatums" and "forced" 
you and your client to agree to unconscionable contract terms cannot square with the true facts of 
this case. As explained in letters from Messrs. Acosta and Sloman, the indictment was postponed 
for more than five months to allow you and Mr. Epstein's other attorneys to make presentations to 
the Office to convince the Office not to prosecute. Those presentations were unsuccessful. As you 
mention in your letter, I —a simple line AUSA — handled the primary negotiations for the Office, and 
conducted those negotiations with you, Ms. Sanchez, Mr. Lewis, and a host of other highly skilled 
and experienced practitioners. As you put it, your group has a "combined 250 years experience" to 
my fourteen. The agreement itself was signed by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Sanchez, and Mr. Lefcaut, 
whose experience speaks for itself. You and I spent hours negotiating the terms, including when to 
use "a" versus "the" and other minutiae. When you and I could not reach agreement, you repeatedly 
went over my head, involving Messrs. Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta in the negotiations at 
various times. In any and all plea negotiations the defendant understands that his options are to 
plead or to continue with the investigation and proceed to trial. Those were the same options that 
were proposed to Mr. Epstein, and they are not "persecution or intimidation tactics." Mr. Epstein 
chose to sign the agreement with the advice of a multitude of extremely noteworthy counsel. 
You also make much of the fact that the names of the victims were not released to Mr. 
Epstein prior to signing the Agreement. You never asked for such a term. During an earlier 
meeting, where Mr. Black was present, he raised the concern that you now voice. Mr. Black and 
I did not have a chance to discuss the issue, but I had already conceived of a way to resolve that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012579 
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 13, 2007 
PAGE 4 OF 5 
issue if it were raised during negotiations. As I stated, it was not, leading me to believe that it was 
not a matter of concern to the defense. Since the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the 
agents and I have vetted the list of victims more than once. In one instance, we decided to remove 
a name because, although the minor victim was touched inappropriately by Mr. Epstein, we decided 
that the link to a payment was insufficient to call it "prostitution." I have always remained open to 
a challenge to the list, so your suggestion that Mr. Epstein was forced to write a blank check is 
simply unfounded. 
Your last set of allegations relates to the investigation of the matter. For instance, you claim 
that some of the victims were informed of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough 
investigation of their allegations against Mr. Epstein. This also is false. None of the victims was 
informed of the right to sue under Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three 
victims were notified shortly after the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement of the general 
terms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim notification, and no further 
notifications were done. Throughout this process you have seen that I have prepared this case as 
though it would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility of damages claims prior 
to concluding the matter by plea or trial would only undermine my case. If my reassurances are 
insufficient, the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein should assure you of 
the integrity of the investigation.' 
'There are numerous other unfounded allegations in your letter about document demands, 
the money laundering investigation, contacting potential witnesses, speaking with the press, and the 
like. For the most part, these allegations have been raised and disproven earlier and need not be 
readdressed. However, with respect to the subpoena served upon the private investigator, contrary 
to your assertion, and as your co-counsel has already been told, I did consult with the Justice 
Department prior to issuing the subpoena and I was told that because I was not subpoenaing an 
attorney's office or an office physically located within an attorney's office, and because the business 
did private investigation work for individuals (rather than working exclusively for Mr. Black), I 
could issue a grand jury subpoena in the normal course, which is what I did. I also did not 
"threaten" the State Attorney's Office with a grand jury subpoena, as the correspondence with their 
grand jury coordinator makes perfectly clear. 
With regard to your allegation of my filing the Palm Beach Police Department's probable 
cause affidavit "with the court knowing that the public could access it," I do not know to what you 
are referring. All documents related to the grand jury investigation have been filed under seal, and 
the Palm Beach Police Department's probable cause affidavit has never been filed with the Court. 
If, in fact, you are referring to the Ex Parte Declaration of Joseph Recarey that was filed in response 
to the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena, it was filed both under seal and ex parte, so no one 
should have access to it except the Court and myself. Those documents are still in the Court file 
only because you have violated one of the terms of the Agreement by failing to "withdraw 
[Epstein's] pending motion to intervene and to quash certain grand jury subpoenas."

With respect to Ms. Miller, I contacted her attorney - who was paid for by Mr. Epstein and 
was directed by counsel for Mr. Epstein to demand immunity - and asked only whether he still 
represented Ms. Miller and if he wanted me to send the victim notification letter to him. He asked 
what the letter would say and I told him that the letter would be forthcoming in about a week and 
that I could not provide him with the terms. With respect to Ms. Miller's status as a victim, you 
again want us to accept as true only facts that are beneficial to your client and to reject as false 
anything detrimental to him. Ms. Miller made a number of statements that are contradicted by 
documentary evidence and a review of her recorded statement shows her lack of credibility with 
respect to a number of statements. Based upon all of the evidence collected, Ms. Miller is classified 
as a victim as defined by statute. Of course, that does not mean that Ms. Miller considers herself 
a victim or that she would seek damages from Mr. Epstein. I believe that a number of the identified 
victims will not seek damages, but that does not negate their legal status as victims. 
I hope that you now understand that your accusations against myself and the agents are 
unfounded. In the future, I recommend that you address your accusations to me so that I can correct 
any misunderstandings before you make false allegations to others in the Department. I hope that 
we can move forward with a professional resolution of this matter, whether that be by your client's 
adherence to the contract that he signed, or by virtue of a trial.

You also accuse me of " broaden [ing] the scope of the investigation without any foundation 
for doing so by adding charges of money laundering and violations of a money transmitting business 
to the investigation." Again, I consulted with the Justice Department's Money Laundering Section 
about my analysis before expanding that scope. The duty attorney agreed with my analysis.

is aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court 
may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting 
a charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein 
hereby requests that the United States Attorney forthe Southern District of Florida defer such 
prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to 
the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be 
deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such 
prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute 
of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing of this 
agreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the 
grand jury's investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the 
Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all 
felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees 
and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the 
subject of the grand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed 
by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as 
to any such offense.

Re: Grand Jury Investigation—Confidential 
Dear 
This letter is an invitation for you to testify before a federal Grand Jury, and is 
supplied in order to provide helpful background information about the Grand Jury. The 
Grand Jury consists of from sixteen to twenty-three persons from the Southern District of 
Florida. It is their responsibility to inquire into federal crimes which may have been 
committed in this District. 
As a Grand Jury witness you will be asked to testify and answer questions under oath, 
and to produce records and documents. Only the members of the Grand Jury, attorneys for 
the United States and a stenographer- are permitted in the Grand Jury roorn while you testify.. 
. The U.S. Department of Justice encourages prosecutors to notify an individual in 
appropriate cases that he or she is a target of a grand jury investigation. Accordingly, you 
are hereby notified that you are a target of a federal grand jury investigation in the Southern 
District of Florida concerning suspected violations of federal law, including but not limited 
to, possible violations of Title 18, United- States Code, Sections 2, 371, 1512, 1591, 1952, 
1956, 1960, 2421, 2422, and 2423. 
You are advised that the destruction or alteration of any document required to be 
produced:before the grand jury constitutes serious violation of federal law, including but.not 
limited to Obstraction of justice. 
A "target" is a person as to whom the prosecutors or the Grand Jury have substantial

epos 
evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the 
prosecutors, is a putative defendant. 
This letter constitutes an invitation to you to testify on your own behalf before the 
grand jury about matters under investigation. Of course, you are not required to appear 
before the grand jury. The decision whether to do so is a voluntary matter which is entirely 
up to you. The grand jury, if in fact it learns of this opportunity afforded to you, will be 
instructed not to draw any adverse inference from your failure to appear should you decide 
not to accept this invitation. You mustfurther understand that should you decide to testify, 
your testimony could be used against you if any criminal charges should be flied against you. 
Should you decide to appear before the grand jury, you will have the same rights and 
obligations as any non-immonized grand jury witness. Specifically, 
You may refuse to answer any question if a truthful answer to the question 
would tend to incriminate you. 
You have the right to stop answering questions at any time. 
Anything you say maybe used against you at the grand jury or in a subsequent 
legal proceeding. 
The grand jury will permit. you a reasonable opportunity to ..stop . outside the 
grand jury room to consult with your attorney, if you so desire, at any point 
during the testimony you give, 
Please be further advised that the giving of false testimony before the grand jur3r will 
subject -you to a prosecution for perjury in addition to the violations set forth above. 
As a target of a grand jury investigation who has been asked to appear before the 
grand jury, you may wish to retain the services of an attorney. If you =not afford the 
services of independent counsel, the Court may be able to appoint Counsel to represent you. 
If you would like the United States to ask the Court to appoint an attorney to represent you, 
please contact the undersigned at 561 209-1047, The United States is investigating other 
individuals, and you may be interested in cooperating with the United States against those 
other targets. If you hire an attorney, or if the Court appoints one to represent you, that 
counsel can contact me to discuss that possibility.

Re: Subpoena to Custodian of Records-NES. LLC 
Dear Mr. Lelbouri: 
I write in response to your letter of July 18, 2007 regarding the grand jury subpoena issued 
to the Custodian ofRecords for NES, LLC. Ihave attached an identical subpoena containing areturn 
date of September 11, 2007, and subpoenas for two NES employees, Eric Gany and Harry Beller. 
If you will not be representing Messrs. Gany and Beller, please let me know. 
First, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, a properly executed declaration from. the 
Custodian of Records is needed, and, if no documents responsive to a particular request exist, the 
Custodian should certify that under penalty of perjury. 
Second, you write that NES has no documents responsive to Requests 1 through 5. 'know 
that NES has several credit card accounts for the benefit of the persons who manage Mr. Epstein's 
properties, including Janusz Banasiak and Alfredo Rodriguez. I also know that NES regularly 
receives money from an account that is used to pay expenses at 358 El Milo Way and also wires 
money to that same account Those wire transfers fall within the time period called for by the 
subpoena and number in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. IfNES does not maintain records of 
its banking activities, then I would like to see a copy of its document retention policy, so I have 
added that to the Attachment to the Subpoena. 
Third, Mr. Manche's con:unent to you about potential money laundering charges related only 
to a resolution ofthe case. In other words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close 
its investigation into other areas as well The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will 
be, resolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6 will not be 
withdrawn. The request is not overbroad and is stated with particularity, so please comply with the 
request by the new deadline.

Hi Jay — Sony for the delay. The U.S. Attorney had a last-minute concern, that I think I fixed it 
is in the first "It Appearing" clause following the list of statutes potentially violated). 
After you get the green light, let's discuss the potential representative. The person I am thinking 
of has run a preliminaiy conflicts check and it looks alright. 
Also, to address Mr. Epstein's concern regarding the list of names, I wanted to tell you that I 
have compiled a list of 34 confirmed minors. There are six others, whose names we already 
have, who need to be interviewed by the FBI to confirm whether they were 17 or 18 at the time 
of their activity with Mr. Epstein. Once those interviews are completed, I can finalize the list of 
identified victims, which I will put in a formal document that I will maintain until the time of 
Mr. Epstein's sentencing. 
Assuming that this agreement is fine, please execute at least three copies, and send one to me by 
fax and the rest by FedEx. I will execute and send the copies back. 
Thank you.

Thank you, Jay. I have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and Rolando. I don't 
anticipate it going any further than that. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one 
copy to you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept confidential since it also 
contains identifying information about the girls. 
When we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for the girls, we can discuss 
what I can tell him and the girls about the agreement. I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter 
an update when a resolution was achieved. (Something I wouldn't have promised in light of what 
happened last year.) Rolando is calling, but Rolando knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the 
money issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that 
has been agreed to. Rolando also is telling Chief Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.

Talk to Jack Goldberger about this group. They are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I 
have concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that 
THEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage) if they proceed outside the 
terms of the plea agreement. (Sorry — I just have a bias against plaintiffs' attorneys.) One nice 
thing about Bert is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case. 
Just so you know, I have never met Bert, but a good friend in our appellate section and one of the 
district judges in Miami are good friends with him and recommended him. 
Can you let me know tomorrow? I am going to be out for a while starting on Friday, and I 
would like to get this underway before I leave.

Good morning, Jay. We need to resolve the attorney issue today. It has been 
weeks since execution of the contract, and there is no need for further delay. 
As far as the five attorney names that we will be providing, I propose Bert 
Ocariz, Katherine Ezell at Podhurst Orseck, Stuart Grossman, Ed Rogers, and 
Walter Cobath. 
If you would like to use the same Special Master to resolve fees disputes as 
well as to handle the selection of the attorney, I would recommend that we use 
retired 11th Circuit Judge Joseph Hatchett instead of Judge Davis because of 
Judge Davis's health problems. (No one has contacted Judge Hatchett yet, but 
one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned him as a good choice.) 
I am available for a conference call between 9:00 and 10:00, and between 3:15 
and 6:00. Please call me on my cell and let me know which of 
those times works best for you. 
Thank you.

Subject RE: Conference Call with Bert Ocariz

15:ime§ageiba&beer.r:orwar. 
Hi Jay — I already told Bert that there is no indictment and, as I mentioned, he doesn't really 
need to/want to see the entire plea agreement, .just the relevant paragraphs so that he understands 
what the scope of his representation will be. I think they would be happy knowing that their 
hourly rate will be paid when it is billed. The concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue, 
they don't want to be in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won' 
t pay any more attorneys' fees. 
Two suggestions, that I haven't run past Bert, are: 
1. Mr. Epstein signs a standard fee agreement, where one of his attorneys or 
accountants who is not working on the damages litigation receives a monthly bill with 
attorney's fees charged at an hourly rate and costs billed monthly. The bills will have 
any privileged information redacted. If there is a dispute about a bill that cannot be 
resolved, it will be submitted to a mediator for resolution. 
2. If that is too open-ended for Mr. Epstein, do the hourly/monthly billing until Berl. 
has had a chance to confer with all of the girls to determine how many want him to 
represent them. Once it is known how many girls will be represented by Bert, and maybe 
who those girls are, there can be a more educated discussion about estimated fees and 
costs. 
Just some food for thought. I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be reachable by cell 
Phone. I will make sure Bert is available and confirm the time with you.

Subject: Conference Call with Bert Ocariz 
Hi Jay — Bert's firm has raised a number of good questions about how they are going to get paid 
and setting up a procedure that avoids any conflict of interest with their clients. Are you around 
today to do a conference call? Let me know what times work for you because Bert wants to get 
their conflicts counsel on the call with us. 
These are some of the questions he sent to me. I told Bert that as part of our agreement we (the 
federal government) are not going to indict Mr. Epstein, but gave him an idea of the charges that 
we had planned to bring as related to 18 USC 2255. With respect to question 2, do I have your 
permission to send Bert just that section of the plea agreement that applies to the damages claims 
(I would recommend sending paragraphs 7 through 10, or at least 7 and 8)? Can you talk with 
your client about items 3 and 4? I envisioned Shook Hardy sending regular bills to you, with 
any privileged information redacted, and being paid like every other client pays the bills. 
1. Can we get a copy of the indictment (or can you tell me the nature of the crimes against the girls)?

minor. 
5. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State of New York. 
6. This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million. 
7. This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
8. This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §I391(a) as a substantial 
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations  
9. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
10. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one 
of his victims. 
11. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
12. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach 
HERMAN 8, MERMELSTEIN, P, A. 
- 2 - 
www.hermanlaw_com 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012638 
Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
13. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival. at 
Epstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, 
who gathered the girl' s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen 
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition 
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter 
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and 
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more Iewd, lascivious and 
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced. to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room 
with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He

removed his towel, and laid down naked on the massage table. He dtalanded that Jane remove her 
clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her 
underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane. 
15. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought 
Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was p aid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane 
to him. 
16. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral.

17, Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats

Case 9:08-cv-80232-KAM Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/05/2008 Page 2 of 6 
Factual Allegations  
7. At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of ti-emendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
8. Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2004-2005, Jane Doe, then 16 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and 
became one of his victims. 
9. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
10. An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach 
Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of

improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
11. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at 
Epstein's mansion, the victim would be brought to the kitchen. She would then be led up a flight of 
stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. Once the girl was 
alone in this room, Epstein would enter wearing only a towel to cover his private area. He then 
would lay down on the massage table and perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, 
including masturbation and touching the girl sexually. 
12. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was led up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. She was 
alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing a towel to cover his private parts. He laid down on 
the massage table, and sexually assaulted Jane Doe during the massage. In addition, Jeffrey Epstein 
masturbated during the massage. 
13. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to leave 
the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought Jane home. 
Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was also paid by Epstein for bringing Jane to him. 
14. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 16-year old Jane experienced trauma, 
shock, confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment.

Another suit alleges sex during massage 
By i,ARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Thursday, March 06, 2008 
WEST PALM BEACH — Another woman filed a federal lawsuit against Jeffrey 
Epstein on Wednesday, alleging that he turned a massage she gave him at his Palm 
Beach mansion into a sexual episode when she was 16 years old. 
Identified as "Jane Doe No. 3," she is seeking more than $50 million, the same as 
two other "Jane Does" who filed similar lawsuits in the past six weeks. All three suits were filed by 
Miami lawyer Jeffrey Herman.

Herman subsequently withdrew the first 
Jane Doe's lawsuit because of squabbling 
by her parents over the litigation. The girl 
may refile the suit after she turns 18 in May 
and can make her own decisions, Herman 
said.

him, Herman said. "I do anticipate more

In the latest litigation, Jane Doe No. 3 alleges that she was recruited by a former college student, Haley 
Robson, to give Epstein a massage for money at his waterfront home late in 2004 or early in 2005. 
The lawsuit alleges that, while on the massage table, Epstein sexually touched Jane Doe No. 3, then 
masturbated. She is suing on grounds of sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
"She felt intimidated. She felt scared," Herman said. Jane Doe No. 3 made only the one visit to Epstein's 
home, he said. 
"It's just another copycat lawsuit filed by the same lawyer who appears less interested in the truth than in 
grandstanding with these press conferences," said Jack Goldberger, one of Epstein's attorneys. "We now 
have sworn testimony that girls lied about their age to Jeffrey Epstein, and they were careful in being

convincing that they were over the age of 18." 
Herman said Robson instructed Jane Doe No. 3, "When he asks how old you are, tell him 18 or 19 years 
old." But he said it doesn't matter. "They were underage girls," Herman said. "They were sexually 
assaulted." 
In addition to the civil lawsuits, Epstein was indicted on a single count of felony solicitation of 
prostitution in July 2006 after a lengthy Palm Beach Police Department investigation into his activities 
with underage girls at his home. A resolution has been delayed continually. The case is on Monday's 
court docket but is expected to be rescheduled once again. 
"One of the reasons (Jane Doe No. 3) came forward is she is tired of waiting for justice," Herman said.

Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather 
yesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. 
Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few 
observations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making 
reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact, 
when I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 2l4, 
you and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the 
selection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team 
including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who 
said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have 
long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine 
how much more vetting needs to be done. 
The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of 
the anticipated upcoming events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by 
the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since 
you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end. 
Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB 
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give 
me the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously 
send you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, 
November 29'1. Thanks, 
Jeff

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division 
950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 
Room 2107 
Washington, DC 20530 
Re: Jeffey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Fisher: 
Facsimile: 
(213) 680-8500 
I represent Jeffrey Epstein, who, as you may be aware, was the target of a dual 
investigation by both state and federal authorities in Florida for acts relating to his interactions 
with numerous young women. As you may also be aware, Mr. Epstein has entered into a 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the "Agreement") with the United States Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida (the "USAO") to resolve its criminal investigation of him. I run 
writing to. request a meeting with you to discuss certain aspects of this case that I find especially 
troublesome. 
As part of the agreement Mr. Epstein was required to sign to avoid a federal indictment, 
Mr. Epstein was required to waive jurisdiction and liability under 18 U.S.C. §2255 for the 
settlement of monetary claims that might be made by it group of unidentified alleged victims 
who will be identified by the USA() at some point in the future. Neither I, nor any of the other 
defense lawyers involved in this matter, have ever heard of such a procedure. And as part of this 
Agreement, Mr. Epstein is precluded from contesting liability as to civil lawsuits seeking 
monetary compensation for damages brought by any of the identified individuals who elect to 
settle their civil claims for the statutory minimum of either $50,000 (the amount set by Congress 
as of the date of the occurrences) or $150,000 (the amount currently set by statute) or some other 
agreed upon damage amount. We believe that the utilization of 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as a pre-
condition of criminal plea agreements or non-prosecution agreements is highly unusual and 
requires careful consideration and additional guidance by your Office. We also believe that the

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012656 
IURKLAND 8.. ELLIS 
Honorable Mice S. Fisher

manner in which the USAO has interpreted the settlement process for these identified individuals 
under the Agreement requires guidance. These areas are more fully detailed below.* 
First. Federal criminal investigators and prosecutors should not be in the business 
of promoting civil lawsuits as a condition precedent to entering non-prosecution or deferred 
prosecution agreements. This is especially true where the vehicle for the financial settlement 
under the Agreement requires payment in a lump sum without requiring proof of actual injury or 
loss — federal authorities should therefore be particularly sensitive to avoid causing a prejudiced 
and unfair result. 18 U.S.C. § 2255 is a civil statute implanted in the criminal code; in contrast to 
all other criminal restitution statutes, § 2255 fails to correlate payments to specific injuries or 
losses. Instead, the statute presumes that victims have sustained damages of at least a minimum 
lump sum without regard to whether the complainants suffered actual medical, psychological or 
other forms of individualized harm. We presume that it is for this reason that 18 U.S.C. § 2255 
has never before been employed in this manner in connection with a non-prosecution or, as here, 
a deferred prosecution agreement. In short, the USAO is operating in uncharted territory. 
Second. 18 U.S.C. § 2255 creates the potential for compromising witness 
testimony. Although generally the Government may promise or provide traditional consideration 
to potential witnesses, employing a civil statute that promises a lump sum payment to potential 
witnesses without proof of actual liability or damage provides an extraordinary incentive that is 
incompatible with the truth-seeking functions of the criminal justice system. Guidelines or other 
policy directives should be considered to control the extent to which witnesses are informed by 
investigators about the availability of such financial windfalls. Additionally, an inquiry is 
necessary in this specific case to assure that disclosures to potential witnesses did not undermine 
the reliability of the results of the federal criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein. 
Third. The USA() has provided no information as to the specific claims made by 
each identified individual, nor were we provided the names or ages of those individuals or the 
time-frame of the alleged conduct The USAO's reluctance to provide Mr. Epstein with any 
information with respect to the allegations against him leaves wide open the opportunity for 
misconduct by federal investigators. In addition, this information vacuum eliminates the ability 
for Mr. Epstein and/or his agents to verify that the allegations at issue are grounded in real 
evidence. Indeed, the requirement that a target of federal criminal prosecution agree to waive his 
right to contest liability as to unnamed civil complainants creates at minimum an appearance of 
injustice, both because of the obvious Due Process concerns of waiving rights without notice of 
* In addition to the areas identified below, it was and remains our position that federal prosecution of this matter is 
entirely inappropriate based on the prior application and legislative histories of the relevant federal statutes. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012657

Honorable Alice S. Fisher

even the identity of the complainant(s) and because of the involvement of the federal criminal 
justice system in civil settlements between private individuals. 
Fourth. The USA() has improperly insisted that the chosen attorney 
representative should be able to litigate the claims of individuals, which violates the terms of the 
Agreement and deeply infringes upon the spirit and nature of the Agreement. Initially, for the 
sake of expediting a settlement in this matter, we suggested that Mr. Epstein establish a 
restitution fund specifically for the settlement of the identified individuals' civil claims and that 
an impartial, independent representative be appointed to administer that fund. Notably, such a 
restitution fund was created in a federal case, U.S. v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (D Alaska 
2004). The federal prosecutors here rejected this idea, and they insisted that an attorney 
representative, paid for by Mr. Epstein, be appointed. Yet, there was no suggestion at the time 
that the attorney representative's duties included litigating claims on behalf of the identified 
individuals. However, after the parties agreed to the appointment of an attorney representative, 
the prosecutors announced that the criteria for choosing an appropriate attorney representative 
now included that the individual be "a plaintiff's lawyer capable of handling multiple lawsuits 
against high profile attorneys." This interpretation of the scope of the attorney representative's 
role is far outside the common understanding that existed when we negotiated Mr. Epstein's 
settlement with the USAO. Furthermore, we firmly believe that ethics rules preclude the 
representative from litigating claims on behalf of the identified individuals. 
In sum, we believe that the actions undertaken in this matter by the USA() with 
respect to the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 provisions of the Agreement are highly unusual. We respectfully 
request a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the important issues raised by 
the USAO's conduct in this deeply policy-laden matter. 
Sincerely, 
id. Q2

Jay, 
You have renewed your request for certain information which this Office does 
not generally make available in similar pre-indictment situations. After 
carefully considering your request, I have decided, in my capacity as the 
First Assistant U.S. Attorney, not to make an exception here. 
Regarding the Landon Thomas matter, Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his 
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes. 
Regarding the offer to extend the current deadline of March 3, 2008 contained 
in my February 25th email. That offer was based on counsel for Mr. Epstein 
meeting with CEOS the week of March 3rd. You indicate that you are 
unavailable. It is hard to imagine that some or all of the other attorneys 
representing Mr. Epstein cannot serve this function. After all, Mr. Epstein is 
also represented by Dean Kenneth Starr, Martin Weinberg, Roy Black, Gerald 
Lefcourt, Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, Lily Ann Sanchez, and Guy Lewis. 
That being said, the Southern District of Florida will only renew the offer to 
extend the current deadline if you and the CEOS Section Chief mutually agree 
on a timetable by close of business on Friday, February 29, 2008 to meet and 
complete presentations no later than March 19, 2008. Given that CEOS is ready 
to proceed immediately, this seems like more than ample time. As I indicated 
in my previous email, if CEOS subsequently decides that a federal prosecution 
should not be undertaken against Mr_ Epstein, this Office will close its 
investigation. However, should CEOS disagree with Mr. Epstein's position, Mr. 
Epstein shall have one week to abide by the terms and conditions of the 
September 24, 2007 Agreement as amended by letter from United States Attorney 
Acosta.

Re: Investigation of Jeffery Epstein 
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz: 
Pursuant to your request and the request of U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta, we have 
independently evaluated certain issues raised in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein to determine 
whether a decision to prosecute Mr. Epstein for federal criminal violations would contradict 
criminal enforcement policy interests. As part of our evaluation, we have reviewed letters 
written on behalf of Mr. Epstein on February 1, 2007, June 25, 2007, July 6, 2007, March 28, 
2008, April 8, 2008, April 28, 2008, and May 14, 2008, with their attachments. We have also 
reviewed memos prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office. As you will recall, we met with you 
and other representatives of Mr. Epstein to further discuss your views on the propriety of a 
federal prosecution. We have discussed the factual and legal issues you raise with the Criminal 
Division's Appellate Section, and we consulted with the Office of Enforcement Operations 
concerning the petite policy. 
We are examining the narrow question as to whether there is a legitimate basis for the 
U.S. Attorney's Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Ultimately, the 
prosecutorial decision making authority within a U.S. Attorney's Office lies with the U.S. 
Attorney. Therefore, to borrow a phrase from the case law, the question we soudit to answer 
was whether U.S. Attorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he authorized prosecution in this 
case. 
As you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and legally. We have not 
looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to re-
conduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch. Furthermore, we did not analyze any issues 
concerning prosecution under federal statutes that do not pertain to child exploitation, such as the 
money laundering statutes, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012670 
05/16/2008 11:16 FAX 
05/16/08 FRI 11:08 FAX 
0003/006 
Q003 
As was made clear at the outset, we did not review the facts, circumstances, or terms 
included in the plea offer, nor any allegations that individuals involved in the investigation 
engaged in misconduct. Despite that agreement, we note that your letters of April 8, April 28, 
and May 14 focus in large part on accusations of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct. Not 
only do allegations of prosecutorial misconduct fall outside the boundary of our agreed review, 
they also fall outside the authority of the Criminal Division in the first instance. Simply, the 
Criminal Division does not investigate or resolve allegations of professional misconduct by 
federal prosecutors. For these reasons, we do not respond to the portion of those letters that 
discuss alleged misconduct. 
Based on our review of all of these materials, and after careful consideration of the issues, 
we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize prosecution 
in this case. We will briefly address each of the issues that you have raised. 
Knowledge of age. Federal child exploitation statutes differ as to whether there must be 
proof that the defendant was aware that the children were under the age of 18. However, even 
for those statutes where knowledge of age is an element of the offense, it is possible to satisfy 
that element with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest 
that the person was a minor. For that reason, the fact that some of the individuals allegedly lied 
to Mr. Epstein about their age is not dispositive of the issue. While there may be an open factual 
issue as to Mr. Epstein's knowledge, we cannot say that it would be impossible to prove 
knowledge of age for any such charges which require it. Therefore, Mr. Acosta could rightfully 
conclude that this factual issue is best resolved by a jury. 
Travel for the purpose. In the materials you prepared, you suggest that Mr. Epstein 
should not be charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(1,) because his dominant purpose in going 
to Florida was not to engage in illegal sexual activity, but rather to return to one of his residences. 
While we fully understand your argument, we also find that the U.S. Attorney's office has a good 
faith basis fully to develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide 
whether the law properly reaches such conduct. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his discretion 
if he decided to pursue such a course of action. 
Intent to engage in the conduct at the time of travel, Based on our review of the facts of 
this case, we respectfully disagree that there is no evidence concerning Mr. Epstein's intent when 
he traveled, and when that intent was formed. Should Mr. Acosta elect to let the case proceed so 
that a jury can resolve this factual issue, he would be within his discretion to do so. 
Use of a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce. Much of the materials you 
have prepared and much of the meeting we had focused on 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), specifically your 
contention that Mr. Epstein did not use the phone to coerce anyone to engage in illegal sexual 
activity.. We understand the issue you raise concerning the statutory interpretation. As before, 
however, we cannot agree that there is no evidence that would support a charge under Section 
2422(b), nor can we agree that there is no argument in support of the application of that statute to 
this case. Finally, our assessment is that the application of that statute to these facts would not be 
2 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012671 
05/16/2008 11:16 FAX 
05/16/08 FRI 11:09 FAX 
g1004/006 
0004 
so novel as to implicate the so-called "clear statement rule," the Ex Post Facto clause, or the Due 
Process clause. As with the other legal issues, Mr. Acosta may elect to proceed with the case. 
Absence of coercion. With respect to 18 § 1591, the alleged absence of the use of 
force, fraud, or coercion is of no moment. The statute does not require the use of force, fraud, 
and coercion against minors. Because of their age, a degree of coercion is presumed. In your 
materials, you note that the statute requires that the minors must be "caused" to engage in a 
commercial sex act, further arguing that the word "cause" suggests that a certain amount of 
undue influence was used. We reject that interpretation, as it would read back into the offense an 
element—coercion—that Congress has expressly excluded. We have successfully prosecuted 
defendants for the commercial sexual exploitation of minors, even when the minors testified that 
not only did they voluntarily engage in the commercial, sex acts, it was their idea to do so. As 
such, Mr. Acosta could properly decide to pursue charges under Section 1591 even if there is no 
evidence of coercion. 
More broadly, a defendant's criminal liability does not hinge on his victim identifying as 
having suffered at his hands. Therefore, a prosecution could proceed, should Mr. Acosta decide 
to do so, even though some of the young women allegedly have said that they do not view 
themselves as victims. 
Witness credibility. As all prosecutors know, there are no perfect witnesses. Particularly 
in cases involving exploited children, as one member of your defense team, Ms. Thacker, surely 
knows from her work at CEOS, it is not uncommon for victim-witnesses to give conflicting 
statements. The prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witness's credibility. Often, the 
prosecutor may decide that the best approach is to present th.e witness, let defense counsel 
explore the credibility problems on cross-examination, and let the jury resolve the issue. Mr. 
Acosta would be within his authority to select that approach, especially when here there are 
multiple, mutually-corroborating witnesses. 
Contradictions and omissions in the search warrant application. We have carefully 
reviewed the factual issues you raise concerning the search warrant application. For a search 
warrant to be suppressed, however, the factual errors must be material, and the officers must not 
have proceeded in good faith. Despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S. 
Attorney's Office could still plausibly argue that the mistakes—whether inadvertent or 
intentional—were not material to the determination that probable cause existed for a search, and 
that the search was in good faith in any event. As such, Mr. Acosta could properly elect to 
defend the search warrant in court rather than forego prosecution. 
Petite 1?olicy: After reviewing the petite policy and consulting with the Office of 
Enforcement Operations ("0E0"), we conclude that the petite policy does not prohibit federal 
prosecution in this case, According to the U.S. Attorney's Manual, the petite policy "applies 
whenever there has been a prior state or federal prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a 
conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, or a dismissal or other termination of

005 
the case on the merits after jeopardy has attached." USAIVI 9-2.031(C). Our understanding is 
that the state case is still pending. As such, tehe procedural posture of the state case does not 
implicate the petite policy. 
We recognize that the petite policy could be triggered if the state case concluded after a 
federal indictment was issued but prior to the commencement of any federal trial. Id. However, 
the policy "does not apply ... where the [state] prosecution involved only a minor part of the 
contemplated federal charges." USAM 9-2.031(B). Based on our understanding of the possible 
federal charges and existing state charges, we do not think the petite policy would be an issue 
should federal proceedings take place. 
Federalism and Prosecutorial Discretion. All of the above issues essentially ask whether 
a federal prosecution can proceed. We understand, however, that you also ask whether a federal 
prosecution should proceed, even in the event that all of the elements of a federal offense could 
be proven. On this issue, you raised two arguments: that the conduct at issue here is traditionally 
a state concern because the activity is entirely local, and that the typical prosecution under federal 
child exploitation statutes have different facts than the ones implicated here. You have 
essentially asked us to look into whether a prosecution would so violate federal prosecutorial 
policy that a United States Attorney's Office should not pursue a prosecution. We do not think 
that is the case here for the following reasons. 
Simply, the commercial sexual exploitation of children is a federal concern, even when 
the conduct is local, and regardless of whether the defendant provided the child (the "pimp") or 
paid for the child (the `John"). In your materials, you refer to a letter sent by the Department of 
Justice to Congress in which the Department expresses concern over the expansion of federal 
laws to reach almost all instances of prostitution. In that portion of the letter, the Department 
was expressly referring to a proposed federal law that reach adult prostitution where no force, 
fraud, or coercion was used. Indeed, the point being made in that letter is that the Department's 
efforts are properly focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the 
exploitation of adults through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. As such, there is no 
inconsistency between the position taken in that letter and the federal prosecution of wholly local 
instances of the commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
If Congress wanted to limit the reach of federal statutes only to those who profit from the 
commercial sexual exploitation of children, or only to those who actually traffic children across 
state lines, it could have done so. It did not. Finally, that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not 
look precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive. We can say with confidence 
that this case is consistent in principle with other federal prosecutions nationwide. As such, Mr. 
Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution even though it might 
involve a novel application of a federal statute. 
Conc/usion. After carefully considering all the factual and legal issues raised, as well as 
the arguments concerning the general propriety ()fa federal case against Mr. Epstein on these

facts, we conclude that federal prosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate. 
While you raise many compelling arguments, we do not see anything that says to us categorically 
that a federal case should not be brought. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial 
discretion should he authorize federal prosecution of Mr.. glutei

Subject Re: EpsteinCi 
Dear Jeff: 
I received your email yesterday and was a little surprised at the tone of your letter, given 
the fact that we spoke last week and had what I thought was a productive meeting. I was 
especially surprised given that your letter arrived on only the second day back to work after the 
Thanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands regarding timing suggest that I have been sitting on 
my hands for days. 
You should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis's selection of Podhurst 
and Josephsberg, and indeed the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you 
on Wednesday of last week. Nevertheless, I have now been able to confer with my client, and we 
have determined that the selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable to us, reserving, of 
course, our previously stated objections to the manner in which you have interpreted the section 
2255 portions of the Agreement. 
We do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged 
victims. Without a fair opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is 
completely unacceptable that you would send it without our consideration. Additionally, given 
that the US Attorney's office has made clear it cannot vouch for the claims of the victims, it 
would be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such a letter. Indeed, because it is 
a certainty that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your actions will only 
have the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him. 
We believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, inappropriate for the Government to be 
the instigator of such lawsuits. 
Finally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims 
pursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute 
under the Non-Prosecution Agreement for the settlement of civil remedies, does not have any 
connection to the Justice for All Act. Section 2255 was enacted as part of a different statute. 
Second, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 2255 is not a restitution statute. 
It is a civil remedy. As you know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged

victims in this matter; however that option was rejected by your Office. Had that option been 
chosen, we would not object to your notifying the alleged victims at this point. At this juncture, 
however, we do not accept your contention that there is a requirement that the government notify 
the alleged victims of a potential civil remedy in this case. 
Accordingly, for all the reasons we have stated above, we respectfully -- and firmly --
object to your sending any letter whatsoever to the alleged victims in this matter. Furthermore, if 
a letter is to be sent to these individuals, we believe we should have a right to review and make 
objections to that submission prior to it being sent to any alleged victims. We also request that if 
your Office believes that it must send a letter to go to the alleged victims, who still have not been 
identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his plea. This letter should 
then come from the attorney representative, and not from the Government, to avoid any bias. 
As you know, Judge Starr has requested a meeting with Assistant Attorney General Fisher 
to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component of the 
Agreement. We are hopeful that this meeting will take place as early as next week. Accordingly, 
we respectfully request that we postpone our discussion of sending a letter to the alleged victims 
until after that meeting. We strongly believe that rushing to send any letter out this week is not 
the wisest manner in which to proceed. Given that Mr. Epstein will not even enter his plea for 
another few weeks, time is clearly not of the essence regarding any notification to the identified 
individuals. 
Thanks very much, 
Jay

Subject Epstein 
Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather 
yesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. 
Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few 
observations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making 
reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact, 
when I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 2e, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012677 
you and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the 
selection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team 
including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who 
said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have 
long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine 
how much more vetting needs to be done. 
The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of 
the anticipated upcoming events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by 
the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since 
you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end. 
Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB 
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give 
me the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously 
send you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, 
November 29th. Thanks, 
Jeff

-----Message from "A. on Fri, ----- 
To: "Lilly 
Subject: Menchel 
Dear Lilly: 
Thank you for your letter of August 2nd regarding your proposal on how to resolve the Epstein 
matter. 
As we explained at our meeting on July 31, 2007, the Office believes that the federal interest 
will not be vindicated in the absence of a two-year term of state imprisonment for Mr. Epstein. 
That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum term of 
imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has never agreed 
that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we simply stated that if Mr. 
Epstein preferred to serve his sentence in a federal penetentiary, we would be willing to explore a 
federal conviction that may allow that in lieu of any state resolution. Further, as I made clear in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 012680 
our follow up telephone conversation after the meeting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was 
never extended or meant as an offer. 
We also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of the minor 
girls identified during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis of an initial 
planned charging instrument. 
As you know, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically changed upon the 
return of an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does not intend to file a 
Superseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case in favor of state 
prosecution. 
Please let us know your client's decision by no later than August 17. I have conferred with U.S. 
Attorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of incarceration is a 
non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time, he is not inclined to 
meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein. 
Sincerely, 
R. Alexander Acosta 
United States Attorney

Your understanding from Jack Goldberger conforms to my understanding that Mr. Epstein's plea 
and sentence will take place on the same day. I understand that the plea and sentence will occur 
on or before the January 4th date.
