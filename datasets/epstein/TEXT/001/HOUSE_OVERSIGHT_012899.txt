Engineering General Intelligence, Part 1:
A Path to Advanced AGI via Embodied Learning and
Cognitive Synergy
September 19, 2013

This book is dedicated by Ben Goertzel to his beloved,
departed grandfather, Leo Zwell – an amazingly
warm-hearted, giving human being who was also a deep
thinker and excellent scientist, who got Ben started on the
path of science. As a careful experimentalist, Leo would
have been properly skeptical of the big hypotheses made
here – but he would have been eager to see them put to the
test!

Preface
This is a large, two-part book with an even larger goal: To outline a practical approach to
engineering software systems with general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond.
Machines with flexible problem-solving ability, open-ended learning capability, creativity and
eventually, their own kind of genius.
Part 1, this volume, reviews various critical conceptual issues related to the nature of intelligence
and mind. It then sketches the broad outlines of a novel, integrative architecture for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) called CogPrime ... and describes an approach for giving a
young AGI system (CogPrime or otherwise) appropriate experience, so that it can develop its
own smarts, creativity and wisdom through its own experience. Along the way a formal theory
of general intelligence is sketched, and a broad roadmap leading from here to human-level artificial
intelligence. Hints are also given regarding how to eventually, potentially create machines
advancing beyond human level – including some frankly futuristic speculations about strongly
self-modifying AGI architectures with flexibility far exceeding that of the human brain.
Part 2 then digs far deeper into the details of CogPrime’s multiple structures, processes and
functions, culminating in a general argument as to why we believe CogPrime will be able to
achieve general intelligence at the level of the smartest humans (and potentially greater), and
a detailed discussion of how a CogPrime-powered virtual agent or robot would handle some
simple practical tasks such as social play with blocks in a preschool context. It first describes
the CogPrime software architecture and knowledge representation in detail; then reviews the
cognitive cycle via which CogPrime perceives and acts in the world and reflects on itself; and
next turns to various forms of learning: procedural, declarative (e.g. inference), simulative and
integrative. Methods of enabling natural language functionality in CogPrime are then discussed;
and then the volume concludes with a chapter summarizing the argument that CogPrime can
lead to human-level (and eventually perhaps greater) AGI, and a chapter giving a thought
experiment describing the internal dynamics via which a completed CogPrime system might
solve the problem of obeying the request “Build me something with blocks that I haven’t seen
before.”
The chapters here are written to be read in linear order – and if consumed thus, they tell
a coherent story about how to get from here to advanced AGI. However, the impatient reader
may be forgiven for proceeding a bit nonlinearly. An alternate reading path for the impatient
reader would be to start with the first few chapters of Part 1, then skim the final two chapters of
Part 2, and then return to reading in linear order. The final two chapters of Part 2 give a broad
overview of why we think the CogPrime design will work, in a way that depends on the technical

details of the previous chapters, but (we believe) not so sensitively as to be incomprehensible
without them.
This is admittedly an unusual sort of book, mixing demonstrated conclusions with unproved
conjectures in a complex way, all oriented toward an extraordinarily ambitious goal. Further,
the chapters are somewhat variant in their levels of detail – some very nitty-gritty, some more
high level, with much of the variation due to how much concrete work has been done on the
topic of the chapter at time of writing. However, it is important to understand that the ideas
presented here are not mere armchair speculation – they are currently being used as the basis
for an open-source software project called OpenCog, which is being worked on by software
developers around the world. Right now OpenCog embodies only a percentage of the overall
CogPrime design as described here. But if OpenCog continues to attract sufficient funding
or volunteer interest, then the ideas presented in these volumes will be validated or refuted
via practice. (As a related note: here and there in this book, we will refer to the "current"
CogPrime implementation (in the OpenCog framework); in all cases this refers to OpenCog as
of late 2013.)
To state one believes one knows a workable path to creating a human-level (and potentially
greater) general intelligence is to make a dramatic statement, given the conventional way of
thinking about the topic in the contemporary scientific community. However, we feel that once
a little more time has passed, the topic will lose its drama (if not its interest and importance),
and it will be widely accepted that there are many ways to create intelligent machines – some
simpler and some more complicated; some more brain-like or human-like and some less so; some
more efficient and some more wasteful of resources; etc. We have little doubt that, from the
perspective of AGI science 50 or 100 years hence (and probably even 10-20 years hence), the
specific designs presented here will seem awkward, messy, inefficient and circuitous in various
respects. But that is how science and engineering progress. Given the current state of knowledge
and understanding, having any concrete, comprehensive design and plan for creating AGI is
a significant step forward; and it is in this spirit that we present here our thinking about the
CogPrime architecture and the nature of general intelligence.
In the words of Sir Edmund Hillary, the first to scale Everest: “Nothing Venture, Nothing
Win.”
Prehistory of the Book
The writing of this book began in earnest in 2001, at which point it was informally referred to
as “The Novamente Book.” The original “Novamente Book” manuscript ultimately got too big
for its own britches, and subdivided into a number of different works – The Hidden Pattern
[Goe06a], a philosophy of mind book published in 2006; Probabilistic Logic Networks [GIGH08],
a more technical work published in 2008; Real World Reasoning [GGC + 11], a sequel to Probabilistic
Logic Networks published in 2011; and the two parts of this book.
The ideas described in this book have been the collaborative creation of multiple overlapping
communities of people over a long period of time. The vast bulk of the writing here was done by
Ben Goertzel; but Cassio Pennachin and Nil Geisweiller made sufficient writing, thinking and
editing contributions over the years to more than merit their inclusion of co-authors. Further,
many of the chapters here have co-authors beyond the three main co-authors of the book; and
the set of chapter co-authors does not exhaust the set of significant contributors to the ideas
presented.
The core concepts of the CogPrime design and the underlying theory were conceived by Ben
Goertzel in the period 1995-1996 when he was a Research Fellow at the University of Western
Australia; but those early ideas have been elaborated and improved by many more people than
can be listed here (as well as by Ben’s ongoing thinking and research). The collaborative design
process ultimately resulting in CogPrime started in 1997 when Intelligenesis Corp. was formed
– the Webmind AI Engine created in Intelligenesis’s research group during 1997-2001 was the
predecessor to the Novamente Cognition Engine created at Novamente LLC during 2001-2008,
which was the predecessor to CogPrime.

Acknowledgements
For sake of simplicity, this acknowledgements section is presented from the perspective of the
primary author, Ben Goertzel. Ben will thus begin by expressing his thanks to his primary
co-authors, Cassio Pennachin (collaborator since 1998) and Nil Geisweiller (collaborator since
2005). Without outstandingly insightful, deep-thinking colleagues like you, the ideas presented
here – let alone the book itself– would not have developed nearly as effectively as what has
happened. Similar thanks also go to the other OpenCog collaborators who have co-authored
various chapters of the book.
Beyond the co-authors, huge gratitude must also be extended to everyone who has been
involved with the OpenCog project, and/or was involved in Novamente LLC and Webmind Inc.
before that. We are grateful to all of you for your collaboration and intellectual companionship!
Building a thinking machine is a huge project, too big for any one human; it will take a team
and I’m happy to be part of a great one. It is through the genius of human collectives, going
beyond any individual human mind, that genius machines are going to be created.
A tiny, incomplete sample from the long list of those others deserving thanks is:
• Ken Silverman and Gwendalin Qi Aranya (formerly Gwen Goertzel), both of whom listened
to me talk at inordinate length about many of the ideas presented here a long, long time
before anyone else was interested in listening. Ken and I schemed some AGI designs at
Simon’s Rock College in 1983, years before we worked together on the Webmind AI Engine.
• Allan Combs, who got me thinking about consciousness in various different ways, at a very
early point in my career. I’m very pleased to still count Allan as a friend and sometime
collaborator! Fred Abraham as well, for introducing me to the intersection of chaos theory
and cognition, with a wonderful flair. George Christos, a deep AI/math/physics thinker from
Perth, for re-awakening my interest in attractor neural nets and their cognitive implications,
in the mid-1990s.
• All of the 130 staff of Webmind Inc. during 1998-2001 while that remarkable, ambitious,
peculiar AGI-oriented firm existed. Special shout-outs to the "Voice of Reason" Pei Wang
and the "Siberian Madmind" Anton Kolonin, Mike Ross, Cate Hartley, Karin Verspoor and
the tragically prematurely deceased Jeff Pressing (compared to whom we are all mental
midgets), who all made serious conceptual contributions to my thinking about AGI. Lisa
Pazer and Andy Siciliano who made Webmind happen on the business side. And of course
Cassio Pennachin, a co-author of this book; and Ken Silverman, who co-architected the
whole Webmind system and vision with me from the start.

in which this book appears, and who has been a strong supporter of the AGI conference
series from the beginning
• My wonderful wife Ruiting Lian, a source of fantastic amounts of positive energy for me
since we became involved four years ago. Ruiting has listened to me discuss the ideas
contained here time and time again, often with judicious and insightful feedback (as she
is an excellent AI researcher in her own right); and has been wonderfully tolerant of me
diverting numerous evenings and weekends to getting this book finished (as well as to other
AGI-related pursuits). And my parents Ted and Carol and kids Zar, Zeb and Zade, who
have also indulged me in discussions on many of the themes discussed here on countless
occasions! And my dear, departed grandfather Leo Zwell, for getting me started in science.
• Crunchkin and Pumpkin, for regularly getting me away from the desk to stroll around the
village where we live; many of my best ideas about AGI and other topics have emerged
while walking with my furry four-legged family members

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1 AI Returns to Its Roots
Our goal in this book is straightforward, albeit ambitious: to present a conceptual and technical
design for a thinking machine, a software program capable of the same qualitative sort of general
intelligence as human beings. It’s not certain exactly how far the design outlined here will be
able to take us, but it seems plausible that once fully implemented, tuned and tested, it will be
able to achieve general intelligence at the human level and in some respects beyond.
Our ultimate aim is Artificial General Intelligence construed in the broadest sense, including
artificial creativity and artificial genius. We feel it is important to emphasize the extremely
broad potential of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The human brain is not built to be
modified, except via the slow process of evolution. Engineered AGI systems, built according to
designs like the one outlined here, will be much more susceptible to rapid improvement from
their initial state. It seems reasonable to us to expect that, relatively shortly after achieving the
first roughly human-level AGI system, AGI systems with various sorts of beyond-human-level
capabilities will be achieved.
Though these long-term goals are core to our motivations, we will spend much of our time here
explaining how we think we can make AGI systems do relatively simple things, like the things
human children do in preschool. The penultimate chapter of (Part 2 of) the book describes a
thought-experiment involving a robot playing with blocks, responding to the request "Build me
something I haven’t seen before." We believe that preschool creativity contains the seeds of,
and the core structures and dynamics underlying, adult human level genius ... and new, as yet
unforeseen forms of artificial innovation.
Much of the book focuses on a specific AGI architecture, which we call CogPrime, and which
is currently in the midst of implementation using the OpenCog software framework. CogPrime
is large and complex and embodies a host of specific decisions regarding the various aspects of
intelligence. We don’t view CogPrime as the unique path to advanced AGI, nor as the ultimate
end-all of AGI research. We feel confident there are multiple possible paths to advanced AGI,
and that in following any of these paths, multiple theoretical and practical lessons will be
learned, leading to modifications of the ideas possessed while along the early stages of the path.
But our goal here is to articulate one path that we believe makes sense to follow, one overall
design that we believe can work.

2 1 Introduction
1.2 AGI versus Narrow AI
An outsider to the AI field might think this sort of book commonplace in the research literature,
but insiders know that’s far from the truth. The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) was founded
in the mid 1950s with the aim of constructing “thinking machines” - that is, computer systems
with human-like general intelligence, including humanoid robots that not only look but act
and think with intelligence equal to and ultimately greater than human beings. But in the
intervening years, the field has drifted far from its ambitious roots, and this book represents
part of a movement aimed at restoring the initial goals of the AI field, but in a manner powered
by new tools and new ideas far beyond those available half a century ago.
After the first generation of AI researchers found the task of creating human-level AGI very
difficult given the technology of their time, the AI field shifted focus toward what Ray Kurzweil
has called "narrow AI" – the understanding of particular specialized aspects of intelligence; and
the creation of AI systems displaying intelligence regarding specific tasks in relatively narrow
domains. In recent years, however, the situation has been changing. More and more researchers
have recognized the necessity – and feasibility – of returning to the original goals of the field.
In the decades since the 1950s, cognitive science and neuroscience have taught us a lot about
what a cognitive architecture needs to look like to support roughly human-like general intelligence.
Computer hardware has advanced to the point where we can build distributed systems
containing large amounts of RAM and large numbers of processors, carrying out complex tasks
in real time. The AI field has spawned a host of ingenious algorithms and data structures, which
have been successfully deployed for a huge variety of purposes.
Due to all this progress, increasingly, there has been a call for a transition from the current
focus on highly specialized “narrow AI” problem solving systems, back to confronting the more
difficult issues of “human level intelligence” and more broadly “artificial general intelligence
(AGI).” Recent years have seen a growing number of special sessions, workshops and conferences
devoted specifically to AGI, including the annual BICA (Biologically Inspired Cognitive
Architectures) AAAI Symposium, and the international AGI conference series (one in 2006,
and annual since 2008). And, even more exciting, as reviewed in Chapter 4, there are a number
of contemporary projects focused directly and explicitly on AGI (sometimes under the name
"AGI", sometimes using related terms such as "Human Level Intelligence").
In spite of all this progress, however, we feel that no one has yet clearly articulated a detailed,
systematic design for an AGI, with potential to yield general intelligence at the human level
and ultimately beyond. In this spirit, our main goal in this lengthy two-part book is to outline
a novel design for a thinking machine – an AGI design which we believe has the capability to
produce software systems with intelligence at the human adult level and ultimately beyond.
Many of the technical details of this design have been previously presented online in a wikibook
[Goe10b]; and the basic ideas of the design have been presented briefly in a series of conference
papers [GPSL03, GPPG06, Goe09c]. But the overall design has not been presented in a coherent
and systematic way before this book. In order to frame this design properly, we also present
a considerable number of broader theoretical and conceptual ideas here, some more and some
less technical in nature.
1.4 The Secret Sauce 3
1.3 CogPrime
The AGI design presented here has not previously been granted a name independently of its
particular software implementations, but for the purposes of this book it needs one, so we’ve
christened it CogPrime . This fits with the name “OpenCogPrime” that has already been
used to describe the software implementation of CogPrime within the open-source OpenCog
AGI software framework. The OpenCogPrime software, right now, implements only a small
fraction of the CogPrime design as described here. However, OpenCog was designed specifically
to enable efficient, scalable implementation of the full CogPrime design (as well as to serve as a
more general framework for AGI R&D); and work currently proceeds in this direction, though
there is a lot of work still to be done and many challenges remain. 1
The CogPrime design is more comprehensive and thorough than anything that has been
presented in the literature previously, including the work of others reviewed in Chapter 4. It
covers all the key aspects of human intelligence, and explains how they interoperate and how
they can be implemented in digital computer software. Part 1 of this work outlines CogPrime at
a high level, and makes a number of more general points about artificial general intelligence and
the path thereto; then Part 2 digs deeply into the technical particulars of CogPrime. Even Part
2, however, doesn’t explain all the details of CogPrime that have been worked out so far, and
it definitely doesn’t explain all the implementation details that have gone into designing and
building OpenCogPrime. Creating a thinking machine is a large task, and even the intermediate
level of detail takes up a lot of pages.
1.4 The Secret Sauce
There is no consensus on why all the related technological and scientific progress mentioned
above has not yet yielded AI software systems with human-like general intelligence (or even
greater levels of brilliance!). However, we hypothesize that the core reason boils down to the
following three points:
• Intelligence depends on the emergence of certain high-level structures and dynamics across
a system’s whole knowledge base;
• We have not discovered any one algorithm or approach capable of yielding the emergence
of these structures;
• Achieving the emergence of these structures within a system formed by integrating a number
of different AI algorithms and structures requires careful attention to the manner in which
1 This brings up a terminological note: At several places in this Volume and the next we will refer to the current
CogPrime or OpenCog implementation; in all cases this refers to OpenCog as of late 2013. We realize the risk
of mentioning the state of our software system at time of writing: for future readers this may give the wrong
impression, because if our project goes well, more and more of CogPrime will get implemented and tested as
time goes on (e.g. within the OpenCog framework, under active development at time of writing). However, not
mentioning the current implementation at all seems an even worse course to us, since we feel readers will be
interested to know which of our ideas – at time of writing – have been honed via practice and which have not.
Online resources such as http://opencog.org may be consulted by readers curious about the current state
of the main OpenCog implementation; though in future forks of the code may be created, or other systems may
be built using some or all of the ideas in this book, etc.
4 1 Introduction
these algorithms and structures are integrated; and so far the integration has not been done
in the correct way.
The human brain appears to be an integration of an assemblage of diverse structures and
dynamics, built using common components and arranged according to a sensible cognitive architecture.
However, its algorithms and structures have been honed by evolution to work closely
together – they are very tightly inter-adapted, in the same way that the different organs of
the body are adapted to work together. Due to their close interoperation they give rise to the
overall systemic behaviors that characterize human-like general intelligence. We believe that
the main missing ingredient in AI so far is cognitive synergy: the fitting-together of different
intelligent components into an appropriate cognitive architecture, in such a way that the
components richly and dynamically support and assist each other, interrelating very closely in
a similar manner to the components of the brain or body and thus giving rise to appropriate
emergent structures and dynamics. This leads us to one of the central hypotheses underlying
the CogPrime approach to AGI: that the cognitive synergy ensuing from integrating
multiple symbolic and subsymbolic learning and memory components in an appropriate
cognitive architecture and environment, can yield robust intelligence at the
human level and ultimately beyond.
The reason this sort of intimate integration has not yet been explored much is that it’s difficult
on multiple levels, requiring the design of an architecture and its component algorithms with
a view toward the structures and dynamics that will arise in the system once it is coupled
with an appropriate environment. Typically, the AI algorithms and structures corresponding
to different cognitive functions have been developed based on divergent theoretical principles,
by disparate communities of researchers, and have been tuned for effective performance on
different tasks in different environments. Making such diverse components work together in a
truly synergetic and cooperative way is a tall order, yet we believe that this – rather than some
particular algorithm, structure or architectural principle – is the “secret sauce” needed to create
human-level AGI based on technologies available today.
1.5 Extraordinary Proof?
There is a saying that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof” and by that standard,
if one believes that having a design for an advanced AGI is an extraordinary claim, this
book must be rated a failure. We don’t offer extraordinary proof that CogPrime, once fully
implemented and educated, will be capable of human-level general intelligence and more.
It would be nice if we could offer mathematical proof that CogPrime has the potential we
think it does, but at the current time mathematics is simply not up to the job. We’ll pursue
this direction briefly in Chapter 7 and other chapters, where we’ll clarify exactly what kind
of mathematical claim “CogPrime has the potential for human-level intelligence” turns out to
be. Once this has been clarified, it will be clear that current mathematical knowledge does not
yet let us evaluate, or even fully formalize, this kind of claim. Perhaps one day rigorous and
detailed analyses of practical AGI designs will be feasible – and we look forward to that day –
but it’s not here yet.
Also, it would of course be profoundly exciting if we could offer dramatic practical demonstrations
of CogPrime’s capabilities. We do have a partial software implementation, in the
OpenCogPrime system, but currently the things OpenCogPrime does are too simple to really
1.5 Extraordinary Proof? 5
serve as proofs of CogPrime’s power for advanced AGI. We have used some CogPrime ideas in
the OpenCog framework to do things like natural language understanding and data mining, and
to control virtual dogs in online virtual worlds; and this has been very useful work in multiple
senses. It has taught us more about the CogPrime design; it has produced some useful software
systems; and it constitutes fractional work building toward a full OpenCog based implementation
of CogPrime. However, to date, the things OpenCogPrime has done are all things that
could have been done in different ways without the CogPrime architecture (though perhaps not
as elegantly nor with as much room for interesting expansion).
The bottom line is that building an AGI is a big job. Software companies like Microsoft spend
dozens to hundreds of man-years building software products like word processors and operating
systems, so it should be no surprise that creating a digital intelligence is also a relatively largescale
software engineering project. As time advances and software tools improve, the number of
man-hours required to develop advanced AGI gradually decreases – but right now, as we write
these words, it’s still a rather big job. In the OpenCogPrime project we are making a serious
attempt to create a CogPrime based AGI using an open-source development methodology,
with the open-source Linux operating system as one of our inspirations. But the open-source
methodology doesn’t work magic either, and it remains a large project, currently at an early
stage. I emphasize this point so that readers lacking software engineering expertise don’t take
the currently fairly limited capabilities of OpenCogPrime as somehow a damning indictment of
the potential of the CogPrime design. The design is one thing, the implementation another –
and the OpenCogPrime implementation currently encompasses perhaps one third to one half
of the key ideas in this book.
So we don’t have extraordinary proof to offer. What we aim to offer instead are clearlyconstructed
conceptual and technical arguments as to why we think the CogPrime design has
dramatic AGI potential.
It is also possible to push back a bit on the common intuition that having a design for humanlevel
AGI is such an “extraordinary claim.” It may be extraordinary relative to contemporary
science and culture, but we have a strong feeling that the AGI problem is not difficult in the
same ways that most people (including most AI researchers) think it is. We suspect that in
hindsight, after human-level AGI has been achieved, people will look back in shock that it took
humanity so long to come up with a workable AGI design. As you’ll understand once you’ve
finished Part 1 of the book, we don’t think general intelligence is nearly as “extraordinary”
and mysterious as it’s commonly made out to be. Yes, building a thinking machine is hard –
but humanity has done a lot of other hard things before. It may seem difficult to believe that
human-level general intelligence could be achieved by something as simple as a collection of
algorithms linked together in an appropriate way and used to control an agent. But we suggest
that, once the first powerful AGI systems are produced, it will become apparent that engineering
human-level minds is not so profoundly different from engineering other complex systems.
All in all, we’ll consider the book successful if a significant percentage of open-minded,
appropriately-educated readers come away from it scratching their chins and pondering: “Hmm.
You know, that just might work.” and a small percentage come away thinking "Now that’s an
initiative I’d really like to help with!".
6 1 Introduction
1.6 Potential Approaches to AGI
In principle, there is a large number of approaches one might take to building an AGI, starting
from the knowledge, software and machinery now available. This is not the place to review
them in detail, but a brief list seems apropos, including commentary on why these are not the
approaches we have chosen for our own research. Our intent here is not to insult or dismiss
these other potential approaches, but merely to indicate why, as researchers with limited time
and resources, we have made a different choice regarding where to focus our own energies.
1.6.1 Build AGI from Narrow AI
Most of the AI programs around today are “narrow AI” programs – they carry out one particular
kind of task intelligently. One could try to make an advanced AGI by combining a bunch of
enhanced narrow AI programs inside some kind of overall framework.
However, we’re rather skeptical of this approach because none of these narrow AI programs
have the ability to generalize across domains – and we don’t see how combining them or extending
them is going to cause this to magically emerge.
1.6.2 Enhancing Chatbots
One could seek to make an advanced AGI by taking a chatbot, and trying to improve its code
to make it actually understand what it’s talking about. We have some direct experience with
this route, as in 2010 our AI consulting firm was contracted to improve Ray Kurzweil’s online
chatbot "Ramona". Our new Ramona understands a lot more than the previous Ramona version
or a typical chatbot, due to using Wikipedia and other online resources, but still it’s far from
an AGI.
A more ambitious attempt in this direction was Jason Hutchens’ a-i.com project, which
sought to create a human child level AGI via development and teaching of a statistical learning
based chatbot (rather than the typical rule-based kind). The difficulty with this approach,
however, is that the architecture of a chatbot is fundamentally different from the architecture
of a generally intelligent mind. Much of what’s important about the human mind is not directly
observable in conversations, so if you start from conversation and try to work toward an AGI
architecture from there, you’re likely to miss many critical aspects.
1.6.3 Emulating the Brain
One can approach AGI by trying to figure out how the brain works, using brain imaging and
other tools from neuroscience, and then emulating the brain in hardware or software.
One rather substantial problem with this approach is that we don’t really understand how
the brain works yet, because our software for measuring the brain is still relatively crude. There
is no brain scanning method that combines high spatial and temporal accuracy, and none is
1.6 Potential Approaches to AGI 7
likely to come about for a decade or two. So to do brain-emulation AGI seriously, one needs to
wait a while until brain scanning technology improves.
Current AI methods like neural nets that are loosely based on the brain, are really not brainlike
enough to make a serious claim at emulating the brain’s approach to general intelligence.
We don’t yet have any real understanding of how the brain represents abstract knowledge, for
example, or how it does reasoning (though the authors, like many others, have made some
speculations in this regard [GMIH08]).
Another problem with this approach is that once you’re done, what you get is something
with a very humanlike mind, and we already have enough of those! However, this is perhaps
not such a serious objection, because a digital-computer-based version of a human mind could
be studied much more thoroughly than a biology-based human mind. We could observe its
dynamics in real-time in perfect precision, and could then learn things that would allow us to
build other sorts of digital minds.
1.6.4 Evolve an AGI
Another approach is to try to run an evolutionary process inside the computer, and wait for
advanced AGI to evolve.
One problem with this is that we don’t know how evolution works all that well. There’s a
field of artificial life, but so far its results have been fairly disappointing. It’s not yet clear how
much one can vary on the chemical structures that underly real biology, and still get powerful
evolution like we see in real biology. If we need good artificial chemistry to get good artificial
biology, then do we need good artificial physics to get good artificial chemistry?
Another problem with this approach, of course, is that it might take a really long time.
Evolution took billions of years on Earth, using a massive amount of computational power. To
make the evolutionary approach to AGI effective, one would need some radical innovations to
the evolutionary process (such as, perhaps, using probabilistic methods like BOA [Pel05] or
MOSES [Loo06] in place of traditional evolution).
1.6.5 Derive an AGI design mathematically
One can try to use the mathematical theory of intelligence to figure out how to make advanced
AGI.
This interests us greatly, but there’s a huge gap between the rigorous math of intelligence
as it exists today and anything of practical value. As we’ll discuss in Chapter 7, most of the
rigorous math of intelligence right now is about how to make AI on computers with dramatically
unrealistic amounts of memory or processing power. When one tries to create a theoretical
understanding of real-world general intelligence, one arrives at quite different sorts of considerations,
as we will roughly outline in Chapter 10. Ideally we would like to be able to study the
CogPrime design using a rigorous mathematical theory of real-world general intelligence, but at
the moment that’s not realistic. The best we can do is to conceptually analyze CogPrime and
its various components in terms of relevant mathematical and theoretical ideas; and perform
analysis of CogPrime’s individual structures and components at varying levels of rigor.
8 1 Introduction
1.6.6 Use heuristic computer science methods
The computer science field contains a number of abstract formalisms, algorithms and structures
that have relevance beyond specific narrow AI applications, yet aren’t necessarily understood
as thoroughly as would be required to integrate them into the rigorous mathematical theory of
intelligence. Based on these formalisms, algorithms and structures, a number of "single formalism/algorithm
focused" AGI approaches have been outlined, some of which will be reviewed in
Chapter 4. For example Pei Wang’s NARS (”Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System”) approach is
based on a specific logic which he argues to be the "logic of general intelligence" – so, while his
system contains many other aspects than this logic, he considers this logic to be the crux of the
system and the source of its potential power as an AGI system.
The basic intuition on the part of these "single formalism/algorithm focused" researchers
seems to be that there is one key formalism or algorithm underlying intelligence, and if you
achieve this key aspect in your AGI program, you’re going to get something that fundamentally
thinks like a person, even if it has some differences due to its different implementation and
embodiment. On the other hand, it’s also possible that this idea is philosophically incorrect:
that there is no one key formalism, algorithm, structure or idea underlying general intelligence.
The CogPrime approach is based on the intuition that to achieve human-level, roughly humanlike
general intelligence based on feasible computational resources, one needs an appropriate
heterogeneous combination of algorithms and structures, each coping with different types of
knowledge and different aspects of the problem of achieving goals in complex environments.
1.6.7 Integrative Cognitive Architecture
Finally, to create advanced AGI one can try to build some sort of integrative cognitive architecture:
a software system with multiple components that each carry out some cognitive function,
and that connect together in a specific way to try to yield overall intelligence.
Cognitive science gives us some guidance about the overall architecture, and computer science
and neuroscience give us a lot of ideas about what to put in the different components. But still
this approach is very complex and there is a lot of need for creative invention.
This is the approach we consider most “serious” at present (at least until neuroscience advances
further). And, as will be discussed in depth in these pages, this is the approach we’ve
chosen: CogPrime is an integrative AGI architecture.
1.6.8 Can Digital Computers Really Be Intelligent?
All the AGI approaches we’ve just mentioned assume that it’s possible to make AGI on digital
computers. While we suspect this is correct, we must note that it isn’t proven.
It might be that – as Penrose [Pen96], Hameroff [Ham87] and others have argued – we need
quantum computers or quantum gravity computers to make AGI. However, there is no evidence
of this at this stage. Of course the brain like all matter is described by quantum mechanics,
but this doesn’t imply that the brain is a “macroscopic quantum system” in a strong sense
(like, say, a Bose-Einstein condensate). And even if the brain does use quantum phenomena in
1.7 Five Key Words 9
a dramatic way to carry out some of its cognitive processes (a hypothesis for which there is no
current evidence), this doesn’t imply that these quantum phenomena are necessary in order to
carry out the given cognitive processes. For example there is evidence that birds use quantum
nonlocal phenomena to carry out navigation based on the Earth’s magnetic fields [GRM + 11];
yet scientists have built instruments that carry out the same functions without using any special
quantum effects. The importance of quantum phenomena in biology (except via their obvious
role in giving rise to biological phenomena describable via classical physics) remains a subject
of debate [AGBD + 08].
Quantum “magic” aside, it is also conceivable that building AGI is fundamentally impossible
for some other reason we don’t understand. Without getting religious about it, it is rationally
quite possible that some aspects of the universe are beyond the scope of scientific methods.
Science is fundamentally about recognizing patterns in finite sets of bits (e.g. finite sets of
finite-precision observations), whereas mathematics recognizes many sets much larger than this.
Selmer Bringsjord [BZ03], and other advocates of “hypercomputing” approaches to intelligence,
argue that the human mind depends on massively large infinite sets and therefore can never be
simulated on digital computers nor understood via finite sets of finite-precision measurements
such as science deals with.
But again, while this sort of possibility is interesting to speculate about, there’s no real reason
to believe it at this time. Brain science and AI are both very young sciences and the “working
hypothesis” that digital computers can manifest advanced AGI has hardly been explored at
all yet, relative to what will be possible in the next decades as computers get more and more
powerful and our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science gets more and more
complete. The CogPrime AGI design presented here is based on this working hypothesis.
Many of the ideas in the book are actually independent of the “mind can be implemented
digitally” working hypothesis, and could apply to AGI systems built on analog, quantum or
other non-digital frameworks – but we will not pursue these possibilities here. For the moment,
outlining an AGI design for digital computers is hard enough! Regardless of speculations about
quantum computing in the brain, it seems clear that AGI on quantum computers is part of our
future and will be a powerful thing; but the description of a CogPrime analogue for quantum
computers will be left for a later work.
1.7 Five Key Words
As noted, the CogPrime approach lies squarely in the integrative cognitive architecture camp.
But it is not a haphazard or opportunistic combination of algorithms and data structures. At
bottom it is motivated by the patternist philosophy of mind laid out in Ben Goertzel’s book
The Hidden Pattern [Goe06a], which was in large part a summary and reformulation of ideas
presented in a series of books published earlier by the same author [Goe94], [Goe93a], [Goe93b],
[Goe97], [Goe01]. A few of the core ideas of this philosophy are laid out in Chapter 3, though
that chapter is by no means a thorough summary.
One way to summarize some of the most important yet commonsensical parts of the patternist
philosophy of mind, in an AGI context, is to list five words: perception, memory, prediction,
action, goals.
In a phrase: “A mind uses perception and memory to make predictions about
which actions will help it achieve its goals.”
10 1 Introduction
This ties in with the ideas of many other thinkers, including Jeff Hawkins’ “memory/prediction”
theory [HB06], and it also speaks directly to the formal characterization of intelligence
presented in Chapter 7: general intelligence as “the ability to achieve complex goals in complex
environments.”
Naturally the goals involved in the above phrase may be explicit or implicit to the intelligent
agent, and they may shift over time as the agent develops.
Perception is taken to mean pattern recognition: the recognition of (novel or familiar) patterns
in the environment or in the system itself. Memory is the storage of already-recognized
patterns, enabling recollection or regeneration of these patterns as needed. Action is the formation
of patterns in the body and world. Prediction is the utilization of temporal patterns to
guess what perceptions will be seen in the future, and what actions will achieve what effects in
the future – in essence, prediction consists of temporal pattern recognition, plus the (implicit
or explicit) assumption that the universe possesses a "habitual tendency" according to which
previously observed patterns continue to apply.
1.7.1 Memory and Cognition in CogPrime
Each of these five concepts has a lot of depth to it, and we won’t say too much about them in
this brief introductory overview; but we will take a little time to say something about memory
in particular.
As we’ll see in Chapter 7, one of the things that the mathematical theory of general intelligence
makes clear is that, if you assume your AI system has a huge amount of computational
resources, then creating general intelligence is not a big trick. Given enough computing power,
a very brief and simple program can achieve any computable goal in any computable environment,
quite effectively. Marcus Hutter’s AIXI tl design [Hut05] gives one way of doing this,
backed up by rigorous mathematics. Put informally, what this means is: the problem of AGI is
really a problem of coping with inadequate compute resources, just as the problem of natural
intelligence is really a problem of coping with inadequate energetic resources.
One of the key ideas underlying CogPrime is a principle called cognitive synergy, which
explains how real-world minds achieve general intelligence using limited resources, by appropriately
organizing and utilizing their memories.
This principle says that there are many different kinds of memory in the mind: sensory,
episodic, procedural, declarative, attentional, intentional. Each of them has certain learning
processes associated with it; for example, reasoning is associated with declarative memory.
Synergy arises here in the way the learning processes associated with each kind of memory have
got to help each other out when they get stuck, rather than working at cross-purposes.
Cognitive synergy is a fundamental principle of general intelligence – it doesn’t tend to play
a central role when you’re building narrow-AI systems.
In the CogPrime approach all the different kinds of memory are linked together in a single
meta-representation, a sort of combined semantic/neural network called the AtomSpace. It
represents everything from perceptions and actions to abstract relationships and concepts and
even a system’s model of itself and others. When specialized representations are used for other
types of knowledge (e.g. program trees for procedural knowledge, spatiotemporal hierarchies
for perceptual knowledge) then the knowledge stored outside the AtomSpace is represented via
1.8 Virtually and Robotically Embodied AI 11
tokens (Atoms) in the AtomSpace, allowing it to be located by various cognitive processes, and
associated with other memory items of any type.
So for instance an OpenCog AI system has an AtomSpace, plus some specialized knowledge
stores linked into the AtomSpace; and it also has specific algorithms acting on the AtomSpace
and appropriate specialized stores corresponding to each type of memory. Each of these algorithms
is complex and has its own story; for instance (an incomplete list, for more detail see
the following section of this Introduction):
• Declarative knowledge is handled using Probabilistic Logic Networks, described in Chapter
34 and others;
• Procedural knowledge is handled using MOSES, a probabilistic evolutionary learning algorithm
described in Chapter 21 and others;
• Attentional knowledge is handled by ECAN (economic attention allocation), described in
Chapter 23 and others;
• OpenCog contains a language comprehension system called RelEx that takes English sentences
and turns them into nodes and links in the AtomSpace. It’s currently being extended
to handle Chinese. RelEx handles mostly declarative knowledge but also involves
some procedural knowledge for linguistic phenomena like reference resolution and semantic
disambiguation.
But the crux of the CogPrime cognitive architecture is not any particular cognitive process,
but rather the way they all work together using cognitive synergy.
1.8 Virtually and Robotically Embodied AI
Another issue that will arise frequently in these pages is embodiment. There’s a lot of debate in
the AI community over whether embodiment is necessary for advanced AGI or not. Personally,
we doubt it’s necessary but we think it’s extremely convenient, and are thus considerably
interested in both virtual world and robotic embodiment. The CogPrime architecture itself is
neutral on the issue of embodiment, and it could be used to build a mathematical theorem
prover or an intelligent chat bot just as easily as an embodied AGI system. However, most of
our attention has gone into figuring out how to use CogPrime to control embodied agents in
virtual worlds, or else (to a lesser extent) physical robots. For instance, during 2011-2012 we
are involved in a Hong Kong government funded project using OpenCog to control video game
agents in a simple game world modeled on the game Minecraft [GPC + 11].
Current virtual world technology has significant limitations that make them far less than
ideal from an AGI perspective, and in Chapter 16 we will discuss how they can be remedied.
However, for the medium-term future virtual worlds are not going to match the natural world
in terms of richness and complexity – and so there’s also something to be said for physical
robots that interact with all the messiness of the real world.
With this in mind, in the Artificial Brain Lab at Xiamen University in 2009-2010, we conducted
some experiments using OpenCog to control the Nao humanoid robot [GD09]. The goal
of that work was to take the same code that controls the virtual dog and use it to control the
physical robot. But it’s harder because in this context we need to do real vision processing
and real motor control. A similar project is being undertaken in Hong Kong at time of writing,
involving a collaboration between OpenCog AI developers and David Hanson’s robotics
12 1 Introduction
group. One of the key ideas involved in this project is explicit integration of subsymbolic and
more symbolic subsystems. For instance, one can use a purely subsymbolic, hierarchical pattern
recognition network for vision processing, and then link its internal structures into the nodes
and links in the AtomSpace that represent concepts. So the subsymbolic and symbolic systems
can work harmoniously and productively together, a notion we will review in more detail in
Chapter 26.
1.9 Language Learning
One of the subtler aspects of our current approach to teaching CogPrime is language learning.
Three relatively crisp and simple approaches to language learning would be:
• Build a language processing system using hand-coded grammatical rules, based on linguistic
theory;
• Train a language processing system using supervised, unsupervised or semisupervised learning,
based on computational linguistics;
• Have an AI system learn language via experience, based on imitation and reinforcement and
experimentation, without any built-in distinction between linguistic behaviors and other
behaviors.
While the third approach is conceptually appealing, our current approach in CogPrime (described
in a series of chapters in Part 2) is none of the above, but rather a combination of the
above. OpenCog contains a natural language processing system built using a combination of
the rule-based and statistical approaches, which has reasonably adequate functionality; and our
plan is to use it as an initial condition for ongoing adaptive improvement based on embodied
communicative experience.
1.10 AGI Ethics
When discussing AGI work with the general public, ethical concerns often arise. Science fiction
films like the Terminator series have raised public awareness of the possible dangers of
advanced AGI systems without correspondingly advanced ethics. Non-profit organizations like
the Singularity Institute for AI ((http://singinst.org) have arisen specifically to raise attention
about, and foster research on, these potential dangers.
Our main focus here is on how to create AGI, not how to teach an AGI human ethical
principles. However, we will address the latter issue explicitly in Chapter 12, and we do think it’s
important to emphasize that AGI ethics has been at the center of the design process throughout
the conception and development of CogPrime and OpenCog.
Broadly speaking there are (at least) two major threats related to advanced AGI. One is
that people might use AGIs for bad ends; and the other is that, even if an AGI is made with
the best intentions, it might reprogram itself in a way that causes it to do something terrible.
If it’s smarter than us, we might be watching it carefully while it does this, and have no idea
what’s going on.
1.12 Key Claims of the Book 13
The best way to deal with this second “bad AGI” problem is to build ethics into your AGI
architecture – and we have done this with CogPrime, via creating a goal structure that explicitly
supports ethics-directed behavior, and via creating an overall architecture that supports “ethical
synergy” along with cognitive synergy. In short, the notion of ethical synergy is that there are
different kinds of ethical thinking associated with the different kinds of memory and you want
to be sure your AGI has all of them, and that it uses them together effectively.
In order to create AGI that is not only intelligent but beneficial to other sentient beings,
ethics has got to be part of the design and the roadmap. As we teach our AGI systems, we need
to lead them through a series of instructional and evaluative tasks that move from a primitive
level to the mature human level – in intelligence, but also in ethical judgment.
1.11 Structure of the Book
The book is divided into two parts. The technical particulars of CogPrime are discussed in Part
2; what we deal with in Part 1 are important preliminary and related matters such as:
• The nature of real-world general intelligence, both conceptually and from the perspective
of formal modeling (Section I).
• The nature of cognitive and ethical development for humans and AGIs (Section III).
• The high-level properties of CogPrime, including the overall architecture and the various
sorts of memory involved (Section IV).
• What kind of path may viably lead us from here to AGI, with focus laid on preschool-type
environments that easily foster humanlike cognitive development. Various advanced aspects
of AGI systems, such as the network and algebraic structures that may emerge from them,
the ways in which they may self-modify, and the degree to which their initial design may
constrain or guide their future state even after long periods of radical self-improvement
(Section V).
One point made repeatedly throughout Part 1, which is worth emphasizing here, is the current
lack of a really rigorous and thorough general technical theory of general intelligence. Such a
theory, if complete, would be incredibly helpful for understanding complex AGI architectures
like CogPrime. Lacking such a theory, we must work on CogPrime and other such systems using
a combination of theory, experiment and intuition. This is not a bad thing, but it will be very
helpful if the theory and practice of AGI are able to grow collaboratively together.
1.12 Key Claims of the Book
We will wrap up this Introduction with a systematic list of some of the key claims to be argued
for in these pages. Not all the terms and ideas in these claims have been mentioned in the
preceding portions of this Introduction, but we hope they will be reasonably clear to the reader
anyway, at least in a general sense. This list of claims will be revisited in Chapter 49 near the
end of Part 2, where we will look back at the ideas and arguments that have been put forth in
favor of them, in the intervening chapters.
14 1 Introduction
In essence this is a list of claims such that, if the reader accepts these claims, they should
probably accept that the CogPrime approach to AGI is a viable one. On the other hand if the
reader rejects one or more of these claims, they may find one or more aspects of CogPrime
unacceptable for some reason.
Without further ado, now, the claims:
1. General intelligence (at the human level and ultimately beyond) can be achieved via creating
a computational system that seeks to achieve its goals, via using perception and memory
to predict which actions will achieve its goals in the contexts in which it finds itself.
2. To achieve general intelligence in the context of human-intelligence-friendly environments
and goals using feasible computational resources, it’s important that an AGI system can
handle different kinds of memory (declarative, procedural, episodic, sensory, intentional,
attentional) in customized but interoperable ways.
3. Cognitive synergy: It’s important that the cognitive processes associated with different kinds
of memory can appeal to each other for assistance in overcoming bottlenecks in a manner
that enables each cognitive process to act in a manner that is sensitive to the particularities
of each others’ internal representations, and that doesn’t impose unreasonable delays on
the overall cognitive dynamics.
4. As a general principle, neither purely localized nor purely global memory is sufficient for
general intelligence under feasible computational resources; “glocal” memory will be required.
5. To achieve human-like general intelligence, it’s important for an intelligent agent to have
sensory data and motoric affordances that roughly emulate those available to humans.
We don’t know exactly how close this emulation needs to be, which means that our AGI
systems and platforms need to support fairly flexible experimentation with virtual-world
and/or robotic infrastructures.
6. To work toward adult human-level, roughly human-like general intelligence, one fairly easily
comprehensible path is to use environments and goals reminiscent of human childhood, and
seek to advance one’s AGI system along a path roughly comparable to that followed by
human children.
7. It is most effective to teach an AGI system aimed at roughly human-like general intelligence
via a mix of spontaneous learning and explicit instruction, and to instruct it via a
combination of imitation, reinforcement and correction, and a combination of linguistic and
nonlinguistic instruction.
8. One effective approach to teaching an AGI system human language is to supply it with
some in-built linguistic facility, in the form of rule-based and statistical-linguistics-based
NLP systems, and then allow it to improve and revise this facility based on experience.
9. An AGI system with adequate mechanisms for handling the key types of knowledge mentioned
above, and the capability to explicitly recognize large-scale patterns in itself, should,
upon sustained interaction with an appropriate environment in pursuit of appropriate
goals, emerge a variety of complex structures in its internal knowledge network,
including, but not limited to:
• a hierarchical network, representing both a spatiotemporal hierarchy and an approximate
“default inheritance” hierarchy, cross-linked
• a heterarchical network of associativity, roughly aligned with the hierarchical network
• a self network which is an approximate micro image of the whole network
1.12 Key Claims of the Book 15
• inter-reflecting networks modeling self and others, reflecting a “mirrorhouse” design
pattern
10. Given the strengths and weaknesses of current and near-future digital computers,
a. A (loosely) neural-symbolic network is a good representation for directly storing many
kinds of memory, and interfacing between those that it doesn’t store directly;
b. Uncertain logic is a good way to handle declarative knowledge. To deal with the problems
facing a human-level AGI, an uncertain logic must integrate imprecise probability
and fuzziness with a broad scope of logical constructs. PLN is one good realization.
c. Programs are a good way to represent procedures (both cognitive and physical-action,
but perhaps not including low-level motor-control procedures).
d. Evolutionary program learning is a good way to handle difficult program learning problems.
Probabilistic learning on normalized programs is one effective approach to evolutionary
program learning. MOSES is one good realization of this approach.
e. Multistart hill-climbing, with a strong Occam prior, is a good way to handle relatively
straightforward program learning problems.
f. Activation spreading and Hebbian learning comprise a reasonable way to handle attentional
knowledge (though other approaches, with greater overhead cost, may provide
better accuracy and may be appropriate in some situations).
• Artificial economics is an effective approach to activation spreading and Hebbian
learning in the context of neural-symbolic networks;
• ECAN is one good realization of artificial economics;
• A good trade-off between comprehensiveness and efficiency is to focus on two kinds
of attention: processor attention (represented in CogPrime by ShortTermImportance)
and memory attention (represented in CogPrime by LongTermImportance).
g. Simulation is a good way to handle episodic knowledge (remembered and imagined).
Running an internal world simulation engine is an effective way to handle simulation.
h. Hybridization of one’s integrative neural-symbolic system with a spatiotemporally hierarchical
deep learning system is an effective way to handle representation and learning
of low-level sensorimotor knowledge. DeSTIN is one example of a deep learning system
of this nature that can be effective in this context.
i. One effective way to handle goals is to represent them declaratively, and allocate attention
among them economically. CogPrime’s PLN/ECAN based framework for handling
intentional knowledge is one good realization.
11. It is important for an intelligent system to have some way of recognizing large-scale patterns
in itself, and then embodying these patterns as new, localized knowledge items in
its memory. Given the use of a neural-symbolic network for knowledge representation, a
graph-mining based “map formation” heuristic is one good way to do this.
12. Occam’s Razor: Intelligence is closely tied to the creation of procedures that achieve goals
in environments in the simplest possible way. Each of an AGI system’s cognitive algorithms
should embody a simplicity bias in some explicit or implicit form.
13. An AGI system, if supplied with a commonsensically ethical goal system and an intentional
component based on rigorous uncertain inference, should be able to reliably achieve a much
higher level of commonsensically ethical behavior than any human being.
14. Once sufficiently advanced, an AGI system with a logic-based declarative knowledge approach
and a program-learning-based procedural knowledge approach should be able to

radically self-improve via a variety of methods, including supercompilation and automated
theorem-proving.

Chapter 2
What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?
2.1 Introduction
CogPrime, the AGI architecture on which the bulk of this book focuses, is aimed at the creation
of artificial general intelligence that is vaguely human-like in nature, and possesses capabilities
at the human level and ultimately beyond.
Obviously this description begs some foundational questions, such as, for starters: What is
"general intelligence"? What is "human-like general intelligence"? What is "intelligence" at all?
Perhaps in the future there will exist a rigorous theory of general intelligence which applies
usefully to real-world biological and digital intelligences. In later chapters we will give some
ideas in this direction. But such a theory is currently nascent at best. So, given the present
state of science, these two questions about intelligence must be handled via a combination of
formal and informal methods. This brief, informal chapter attempts to explain our view on the
nature of intelligence in sufficient detail to place the discussion of CogPrime in appropriate
context, without trying to resolve all the subtleties.
Psychologists sometimes define human general intelligence using IQ tests and related instruments
– so one might wonder: why not just go with that? But these sorts of intelligence testing
approaches have difficulty even extending to humans from diverse cultures [HHPO12] [Fis01].
So it’s clear that to ground AGI approaches that are not based on precise modeling of human
cognition, one requires a more fundamental understanding of the nature of general intelligence.
On the other hand, if one conceives intelligence too broadly and mathematically, there’s a risk
of leaving the real human world too far behind. In this chapter (followed up in Chapters 9 and
7 with more rigor), we present a highly abstract understanding of intelligence-in-general, and
then portray human-like general intelligence as a (particularly relevant) special case.
2.1.1 What Is General Intelligence?
Many attempts to characterize general intelligence have been made; Legg and Hutter [LH07a]
review over 70! Our preferred abstract characterization of intelligence is: the capability of a
system to choose actions maximizing its goal-achievement, based on its perceptions
and memories, and making reasonably efficient use of its computational resources
19
20 2 What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?
[Goe10c]. A general intelligence is then understood as one that can do this for a variety of
complex goals in a variety of complex environments.
However, apart from positing definitions, it is difficult to say anything nontrivial about general
intelligence in general. Marcus Hutter [Hut05] has demonstrated, using a characterization
of general intelligence similar to the one above, that a very simple algorithm called AIXI tl can
demonstrate arbitrarily high levels of general intelligence, if given sufficiently immense computational
resources. This is interesting because it shows that (if we assume the universe can
effectively be modeled as a computational system) general intelligence is basically a problem of
computational efficiency. The particular structures and dynamics that characterize real-world
general intelligences like humans arise because of the need to achieve reasonable levels of intelligence
using modest space and time resources.
The “patternist” theory of mind presented in [Goe06a] and briefly summarized in Chapter
3 below presents a number of emergent structures and dynamics that are hypothesized to
characterize pragmatic general intelligence, including such things as system-wide hierarchical
and heterarchical knowledge networks, and a dynamic and self-maintaining self-model. Much of
the thinking underlying CogPrime has centered on how to make multiple learning components
combine to give rise to these emergent structures and dynamics.
2.1.2 What Is Human-like General Intelligence?
General principles like “complex goals in complex environments” and patternism are not sufficient
to specify the nature of human-like general intelligence. Due to the harsh reality of
computational resource restrictions, real-world general intelligences are necessarily biased to
particular classes of environments. Human intelligence is biased toward the physical, social and
linguistic environments in which humanity evolved, and if AI systems are to possess humanlike
general intelligence they must to some extent share these biases.
But what are these biases, specifically? This is a large and complex question, which we seek
to answer in a theoretically grounded way in Chapter 9. However, before turning to abstract
theory, one may also approach the question in a pragmatic way, by looking at the categories of
things that humans do to manifest their particular variety of general intelligence. This is the
task of the following section.
2.2 Commonly Recognized Aspects of Human-like Intelligence
It would be nice if we could give some sort of “standard model of human intelligence” in this
chapter, to set the context for our approach to artificial general intelligence – but the truth is
that there isn’t any. What the cognitive science field has produced so far is better described as:
a broad set of principles and platitudes, plus a long, loosely-organized list of ideas and results.
Chapter 5 below constitutes an attempt to present an integrative architecture diagram for
human-like general intelligence, synthesizing the ideas of a number of different AGI and cognitive
theorists. However, though the diagram given there attempts to be inclusive, it nonetheless
contains many features that are accepted by only a plurality of the research community.
2.2 Commonly Recognized Aspects of Human-like Intelligence 21
The following list of key aspects of human-like intelligence has a better claim at truly being
generic and representing the consensus understanding of contemporary science. It was produced
by a very simple method: starting with the Wikipedia page for cognitive psychology, and then
adding a few items onto it based on scrutinizing the tables of contents of some top-ranked
cognitive psychology textbooks. There is some redundancy among list items, and perhaps also
some minor omissions (depending on how broadly one construes some of the items), but the
point is to give a broad indication of human mental functions as standardly identified in the
psychology field:
• Perception
– General perception
– Psychophysics
– Pattern recognition (the ability to correctly interpret ambiguous sensory information)
– Object and event recognition
– Time sensation (awareness and estimation of the passage of time)
• Motor Control
– Motor planning
– Motor execution
– Sensorimotor integration
• Categorization
– Category induction and acquisition
– Categorical judgement and classification
– Category representation and structure
– Similarity
• Memory
– Aging and memory
– Autobiographical memory
– Constructive memory
– Emotion and memory
– False memories
– Memory biases
– Long-term memory
– Episodic memory
– Semantic memory
– Procedural memory
– Short-term memory
– Sensory memory
– Working memory
• Knowledge representation
– Mental imagery
– Propositional encoding
– Imagery versus propositions as representational mechanisms
22 2 What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?
– Dual-coding theories
– Mental models
• Language
– Grammar and linguistics
– Phonetics and phonology
– Language acquisition
• Thinking
– Choice
– Concept formation
– Judgment and decision making
– Logic, formal and natural reasoning
– Problem solving
– Planning
– Numerical cognition
– Creativity
• Consciousness
– Attention and Filtering (the ability to focus mental effort on specific stimuli whilst
excluding other stimuli from consideration)
– Access consciousness
– Phenomenal consciousness
• Social Intelligence
– Distributed Cognition
– Empathy
If there’s nothing surprising to you in the above list, I’m not surprised! If you’ve read a
bit in the modern cognitive science literature, the list may even seem trivial. But it’s worth
reflecting that 50 years ago, no such list could have been produced with the same level of broad
acceptance. And less than 100 years ago, the Western world’s scientific understanding of the
mind was dominated by Freudian thinking; and not too long after that, by behaviorist thinking,
which argued that theorizing about what went on inside the mind made no sense, and science
should focus entirely on analyzing external behavior. The progress of cognitive science hasn’t
made as many headlines as contemporaneous progress in neuroscience or computing hardware
and software, but it’s certainly been dramatic. One of the reasons that AGI is more achievable
now than in the 1950s and 60s when the AI field began, is that now we understand the structures
and processes characterizing human thinking a lot better.
In spite of all the theoretical and empirical progress in the cognitive science field, however,
there is still no consensus among experts on how the various aspects of intelligence in the above
“human intelligence feature list” are achieved and interrelated. In these pages, however, for
the purpose of motivating CogPrime, we assume a broad integrative understanding roughly as
follows:
• Perception: There is significant evidence that human visual perception occurs using a
spatiotemporal hierarchy of pattern recognition modules, in which higher-level modules
2.2 Commonly Recognized Aspects of Human-like Intelligence 23
deal with broader spacetime regions, roughly as in the DeSTIN AGI architecture discussed
in Chapter 4. Further, there is evidence that each module carries out temporal predictive
pattern recognition as well as static pattern recognition. Audition likely utilizes a similar
hierarchy. Olfaction may use something more like a Hopfield attractor neural network, as
described in Chapter 13. The networks corresponding to different sense modalities have
multiple cross-linkages, more at the upper levels than the lower, and also link richly into
the parts of the mind dealing with other functions.
• Motor Control: This appears to be handled by a spatiotemporal hierarchy as well, in which
each level of the hierarchy corresponds to higher-level (in space and time) movements. The
hierarchy is very tightly linked in with the perceptual hierarchies, allowing sensorimotor
learning and coordination.
• Memory: There appear to be multiple distinct but tightly cross-linked memory systems,
corresponding to different sorts of knowledge such as declarative (facts and beliefs), procedural,
episodic, sensorimotor, attentional and intentional (goals).
• Knowledge Representation: There appear to be multiple base-level representational
systems; at least one corresponding to each memory system, but perhaps more than that.
Additionally there must be the capability to dynamically create new context-specific representational
systems founded on the base representational system.
• Language: While there is surely some innate biasing in the human mind toward learning
certain types of linguistic structure, it’s also notable that language shares a great deal of
structure with other aspects of intelligence like social roles [CB00] and the physical world
[Cas07]. Language appears to be learned based on biases toward learning certain types of
relational role systems; and language processing seems a complex mix of generic reasoning
and pattern recognition processes with specialized acoustic and syntactic processing
routines.
• Consciousness is pragmatically well-understood using Baars’ “global workspace” theory,
in which a small subset of the mind’s content is summoned at each time into a “working
memory” aka “workspace” aka “attentional focus” where it is heavily processed and used to
guide action selection.
• Thinking is a diverse combination of processes encompassing things like categorization,
(crisp and uncertain) reasoning, concept creation, pattern recognition, and others; these
processes must work well with all the different types of memory and must effectively integrate
knowledge in the global workspace with knowledge in long-term memory.
• Social Intelligence seems closely tied with language and also with self-modeling; we model
ourselves in large part using the same specialized biases we use to help us model others.
None of the points in the above bullet list is particularly controversial, but neither are any
of them universally agreed-upon by experts. However, in order to make any progress on AGI
design one must make some commitments to particular cognition-theoretic understandings, at
this level and ultimately at more precise levels as well. Further, general philosophical analyses
like the patternist philosophy to be reviewed in the following chapter only provide limited
guidance here. Patternism provides a filter for theories about specific cognitive functions – it
rules out assemblages of cognitive-function-specific theories that don’t fit together to yield a
mind that could act effectively as a pattern-recognizing, goal-achieving system with the right
internal emergent structures. But it’s not a precise enough filter to serve as a sole guide for
cognitive theory even at the high level.
The above list of points leads naturally into the integrative architecture diagram presented
in Chapter 5. But that generic architecture diagram is fairly involved, and before presenting
24 2 What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?
it, we will go through some more background regarding human-like intelligence (in the rest
of this chapter), philosophy of mind (in Chapter 3) and contemporary AGI architectures (in
Chapter4).
2.3 Further Characterizations of Humanlike Intelligence
We now present a few complementary approaches to characterizing the key aspects of humanlike
intelligence, drawn from different perspectives in the psychology and AI literature. These
different approaches all overlap substantially, which is good, yet each gives a slightly different
slant.
2.3.1 Competencies Characterizing Human-like Intelligence
First we give a list of key competencies characterizing human level intelligence resulting from
the the AGI Roadmap Workshop held at the University of Knoxville in October 2008 1 , which
was organized by Ben Goertzel and Itamar Arel. In this list, each broad competency area is
listed together with a number of specific competencies sub-areas within its scope:
1. Perception: vision, hearing, touch, proprioception, crossmodal
2. Actuation: physical skills, navigation, tool use
3. Memory: episodic, declarative, behavioral
4. Learning: imitation, reinforcement, interactive verbal instruction, written media, experimentation
5. Reasoning: deductive, abductive, inductive, causal, physical, associational, categorization
6. Planning: strategic, tactical, physical, social
7. Attention: visual, social, behavioral
8. Motivation: subgoal creation, affect-based motivation, control of emotions
9. Emotion: expressing emotion, understanding emotion
10. Self: self-awareness, self-control, other-awareness
11. Social: empathy, appropriate social behavior, social communication, social inference, group
play, theory of mind
12. Communication: gestural, pictorial, verbal, language acquisition, cross-modal
13. Quantitative: counting, grounded arithmetic, comparison, measurement
14. Building/Creation: concept formation, verbal invention, physical construction, social
group formation
Clearly this list is getting at the same things as the textbook headings given in Section 2.2,
but with a different emphasis due to its origin among AGI researchers rather than cognitive

psychologists. As part of the AGI Roadmap project, specific tasks were created corresponding
to each of the sub-areas in the above list; we will describe some of these tasks in Chapter 17.
2.3.2 Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences
The diverse list of human-level “competencies” given above is reminiscent of Gardner’s [Gar99]
multiple intelligences (MI) framework – a psychological approach to intelligence assessment
based on the idea that different people have mental strengths in different high-level domains,
so that intelligence tests should contain aspects that focus on each of these domains separately.
MI does not contradict the “complex goals in complex environments” view of intelligence, but
rather may be interpreted as making specific commitments regarding which complex tasks and
which complex environments are most important for roughly human-like intelligence.
MI does not seek an extreme generality, in the sense that it explicitly focuses on domains
in which humans have strong innate capability as well as general-intelligence capability; there
could easily be non-human intelligences that would exceed humans according to both the commonsense
human notion of “general intelligence” and the generic “complex goals in complex
environments” or Hutter/Legg-style definitions, yet would not equal humans on the MI criteria.
This strong anthropocentrism of MI is not a problem from an AGI perspective so long as
one uses MI in an appropriate way, i.e. only for assessing the extent to which an AGI system
displays specifically human-like general intelligence. This restrictiveness is the price one pays
for having an easily articulable and relatively easily implementable evaluation framework.
Table ?? summarizes the types of intelligence included in Gardner’s MI theory.

2.3.3 Newell’s Criteria for a Human Cognitive Architecture
Finally, another related perspective is given by Alan Newell’s “functional criteria for a human
cognitive architecture” [New90], which require that a humanlike AGI system should:
1. Behave as an (almost) arbitrary function of the environment
2. Operate in real time
3. Exhibit rational, i.e., effective adaptive behavior
4. Use vast amounts of knowledge about the environment
5. Behave robustly in the face of error, the unexpected, and the unknown
6. Integrate diverse knowledge
7. Use (natural) language
8. Exhibit self-awareness and a sense of self
9. Learn from its environment
10. Acquire capabilities through development
11. Arise through evolution
12. Be realizable within the brain
In our view, Newell’s criterion 1 is poorly-formulated, for while universal Turing computing
power is easy to come by, any finite AI system must inevitably be heavily adapted to some
particular class of environments for straightforward mathematical reasons [Hut05, GPI + 10].
On the other hand, his criteria 11 and 12 are not relevant to the CogPrime approach as we are
not doing biological modeling but rather AGI engineering. However, Newell’s criteria 2-10 are
essential in our view, and all will be covered in the following chapters.
2.3.4 intelligence and Creativity
Creativity is a key aspect of intelligence. While sometimes associated especially with geniuslevel
intelligence in science or the arts, actually creativity is pervasive throughout intelligence,
at all levels. When a child makes a flying toy car by pasting paper bird wings on his toy car, and
when a bird figures out how to use a curved stick to get a piece of food out of a difficult corner
– this is creativity, just as much as the invention of a new physics theory or the design of a new
fashion line. The very nature of intelligence – achieving complex goals in complex environments
– requires creativity for its achievement, because the nature of complex environments and goals
is that they are always unveiling new aspects, so that dealing with them involves inventing
things beyond what worked for previously known aspects.
CogPrime contains a number of cognitive dynamics that are especially effective at creating
new ideas, such as: concept creation (which synthesizes new concepts via combining aspects
of previous ones), probabilistic evolutionary learning (which simulates evolution by natural
selection, creating new procedures via mutation, combination and probabilistic modeling based
on previous ones), and analogical inference (an aspect of the Probabilistic Logic Networks
subsystems). But ultimately creativity is about how a system combines all the processes at its
disposal to synthesize novel solutions to the problems posed by its goals in its environment.
There are times, of course, when the same goal can be achieved in multiple ways – some
more creative than others. In CogPrime this relates to the existence of multiple top-level goals,
one of which may be novelty. A system with novelty as one of its goals, alongside other more
2.4 Preschool as a View into Human-like General Intelligence 27
specific goals, will have a tendency to solve other problems in creative ways, thus fulfilling its
novelty goal along with its other goals. This can be seen at the level of childlike behaviors, and
also at a much more advanced level. Salvador Dali wanted to depict his thoughts and feelings,
but he also wanted to do so in a striking and unusual way; this combination of aspirations
spurred him to produce his amazing art. A child who is asked to draw a house, but has a
goal of novelty, may draw a tower with a swimming pool on the roof rather than a typical
Colonial structure. A physical motivated by novelty will seek a non-obvious solution to the
equation at hand, rather than just applying tried and true methods, and perhaps discover
some new phenomenon. Novelty can be measured formally in terms of information-theoretic
surprisingness based upon a given basis of knowledge and experience [Sch06]; something that
is novel and creative to a child may be familiar to the adult world, and a solution that seems
novel and creative to a brilliant scientist today, may seem like cliche’ elementary school level
work 100 years from now.
Measuring creativity is even more difficult and subjective than measuring intelligence. Qualitatively,
however, we humans can recognize it; and we suspect that the qualitative emergence
of dramatic, multidisciplinary computational creativity will be one of the things that makes the
human population feel emotionally that advanced AGI has finally arrived.
2.4 Preschool as a View into Human-like General Intelligence
One issue that arises when pursuing the grand goal of human-level general intelligence is how
to measure partial progress. The classic Turing Test of imitating human conversation remains
too difficult to usefully motivate immediate-term AI research (see [HF95] [Fre90] for arguments
that it has been counterproductive for the AI field). The same holds true for comparable alternatives
like the Robot College Test of creating a robot that can attend a semester of university
and obtain passing grades. However, some researchers have suggested intermediary goals, that
constitute partial progress toward the grand goal and yet are qualitatively different from the
highly specialized problems to which most current AI systems are applied.
In this vein, Sam Adams and his team at IBM have outlined a so-called “Toddler Turing
Test,” in which one seeks to use AI to control a robot qualitatively displaying similar cognitive
behaviors to a young human child (say, a 3 year old) [AABL02]. In fact this sort of idea has a
long and venerable history in the AI field – Alan Turing’s original 1950 paper on AI [Tur50],
where he proposed the Turing Test, contains the suggestion that
"Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind,
why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s?"
We find this childlike cognition based approach promising for many reasons, including its integrative
nature: what a young child does involves a combination of perception, actuation, linguistic
and pictorial communication, social interaction, conceptual problem solving and creative
imagination. Specifically, inspired by these ideas, in Chapter 16 we will suggest the approach
of teaching and testing early-stage AGI systems in environments that emulate the preschools
used for teaching human children.
Human intelligence evolved in response to the demands of richly interactive environments,
and a preschool is specifically designed to be a richly interactive environment with the capability
to stimulate diverse mental growth. So, we are currently exploring the use of CogPrime to control
28 2 What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?
virtual agents in preschool-like virtual world environments, as well as commercial humanoid
robot platforms such as the Nao (see Figure 2.1) or Robokind (2.2) in physical preschool-like
robot labs.
Another advantage of focusing on childlike cognition is that child psychologists have created
a variety of instruments for measuring child intelligence. In Chapter 17, we will discuss an
approach to evaluating the general intelligence of human childlike AGI systems via combining
tests typically used to measure the intelligence of young human children, with additional tests
crafted based on cognitive science and the standard preschool curriculum.
To put it differently: While our long-term goal is the creation of genius machines with general
intelligence at the human level and beyond, we believe that every young child has a certain
genius; and by beginning with this childlike genius, we can built a platform capable of developing
into a genius machine with far more dramatic capabilities.
2.4.1 Design for an AGI Preschool
More precisely, we don’t suggest to place a CogPrime system in an environment that is an
exact imitation of a human preschool – this would be inappropriate since current robotic or
virtual bodies are very differently abled than the body of a young human child. But we aim to
place CogPrime in an environment emulating the basic diversity and educational character of
a typical human preschool. We stress this now, at this early point in the book, because we will
use running examples throughout the book drawn from the preschool context.
The key notion in modern preschool design is the “learning center,” an area designed and
outfitted with appropriate materials for teaching a specific skill. Learning centers are designed to
encourage learning by doing, which greatly facilitates learning processes based on reinforcement,
imitation and correction; and also to provide multiple techniques for teaching the same skills,
to accommodate different learning styles and prevent overfitting and overspecialization in the
learning of new skills.
Centers are also designed to cross-develop related skills. A “manipulatives center,” for example,
provides physical objects such as drawing implements, toys and puzzles, to facilitate
development of motor manipulation, visual discrimination, and (through sequencing and classification
games) basic logical reasoning. A “dramatics center” cross-trains interpersonal and
empathetic skills along with bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, and musical skills. Other centers,
such as art, reading, writing, science and math centers are also designed to train not just one
area, but to center around a primary intelligence type while also cross-developing related areas.
For specific examples of the learning centers associated with particular contemporary preschools,
see [Nei98]. In many progressive, student-centered preschools, students are left largely to their
own devices to move from one center to another throughout the preschool room. Generally,
each center will be staffed by an instructor at some points in the day but not others, providing
a variety of learning experiences.
To imitate the general character of a human preschool, we will create several centers in our
robot lab. The precise architecture will be adapted via experience but initial centers will likely
be:
• a blocks center: a table with blocks on it
• a language center: a circle of chairs, intended for people to sit around and talk with the
robot
2.5 Integrative and Synergetic Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence 29
• a manipulatives center, with a variety of different objects of different shapes and sizes,
intended to teach visual and motor skills
• a ball play center: where balls are kept in chests and there is space for the robot to kick
the balls around
• a dramatics center where the robot can observe and enact various movements
One Running Example
As we proceed through the various component structures and dynamics of CogPrime in the
following chapters, it will be useful to have a few running examples to use to explain how the
various parts of the system are supposed to work. One example we will use fairly frequently is
drawn from the preschool context: the somewhat open-ended task of Build me something
out of blocks, that you haven’t built for me before, and then tell me what it is. This
is a relatively simple task that combines multiple aspects of cognition in a richly interconnected
way, and is the sort of thing that young children will naturally do in a preschool setting.
2.5 Integrative and Synergetic Approaches to Artificial General
Intelligence
In Chapter 1 we characterized CogPrime as an integrative approach. And we suggest that the
naturalness of integrative approaches to AGI follows directly from comparing above lists of
capabilities and criteria to the array of available AI technologies. No single known algorithm
or data structure appears easily capable of carrying out all these functions, so if one wants
to proceed now with creating a general intelligence that is even vaguely humanlike, one must
integrate various AI technologies within some sort of unifying architecture.
For this reason and others, an increasing amount of work in the AI community these days
is integrative in one sense or another. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms integrate probabilistic
reasoning with evolutionary learning [Pel05]. Markov Logic Networks [RD06] integrate
formal logic and probabilistic inference, as does the Probabilistic Logic Networks framework
[GIGH08] utilized in CogPrime and explained further in the book, and other works in the
“Progic” area such as [WW06]. Leslie Pack Kaelbling has synthesized low-level robotics methods
(particle filtering) with logical inference [ZPK07]. Dozens of further examples could be given.
The construction of practical robotic systems like the Stanley system that won the DARPA
Grand Challenge [Tea06] involve the integration of numerous components based on different
principles. These algorithmic and pragmatic innovations provide ample raw materials for the
construction of integrative cognitive architectures and are part of the reason why childlike AGI
is more approachable now than it was 50 or even 10 years ago.
Further, many of the cognitive architectures described in the current AI literature are “integrative”
in the sense of combining multiple, qualitatively different, interoperating algorithms.
Chapter 4 gives a high-level overview of existing cognitive architectures, dividing them into
symbolic, emergentist (e.g. neural network) and hybrid architectures. The hybrid architectures
generally integrate symbolic and neural components, often with multiple subcomponents within
each of these broad categories. However, we believe that even these excellent architectures are
not integrative enough, in the sense that they lack sufficiently rich and nuanced interactions
30 2 What Is Human-Like General Intelligence?
between the learning components associated with different kinds of memory, and hence are unlikely
to give rise to the emergent structures and dynamics characterizing general intelligence.
One of the central ideas underlying CogPrime is that with an integrative cognitive architecture
that combines multiple aspects of intelligence, achieved by diverse structures and algorithms,
within a common framework designed specifically to support robust synergetic interactions
between these aspects.
The simplest way to create an integrative AI architecture is to loosely couple multiple components
carrying out various functions, in such a way that the different components pass inputs
and outputs amongst each other but do not interfere with or modulate each others’ internal
functioning in real-time. However, the human brain appears to be integrative in a much tighter
sense, involving rich real-time dynamical coupling between various components with distinct
but related functions. In [Goe09a] we have hypothesized that the brain displays a property of
cognitive synergy, according to which multiple learning processes can not only dispatch
subproblems to each other, but also share contextual understanding in real-time, so
that each one can get help from the others in a contextually savvy way. By imbuing AI architectures
with cognitive synergy, we hypothesize, one can get past the bottlenecks that have
plagued AI in the past. Part of the reasoning here, as elaborated in Chapter 9 and [Goe09b], is
that real physical and social environments display a rich dynamic interconnection between their
various aspects, so that richly dynamically interconnected integrative AI architectures will be
able to achieve goals within them more effectively.
And this brings us to the patternist perspective on intelligent systems, alluded to above and
fleshed out further in Chapter 3 with its focus on the emergence of hierarchically and heterarchically
structured networks of patterns, and pattern-systems modeling self and others. Ultimately
the purpose of cognitive synergy in an AGI system is to enable the various AI algorithms and
structures composing the system to work together effectively enough to give rise to the right
system-wide emergent structures characterizing real-world general intelligence. The underlying
theory is that intelligence is not reliant on any particular structure or algorithm, but is reliant
on the emergence of appropriately structured networks of patterns, which can then be used to
guide ongoing dynamics of pattern recognition and creation. And the underlying hypothesis is
that the emergence of these structures cannot be achieved by a loosely interconnected assemblage
of components, no matter how sensible the architecture; it requires a tightly connected,
synergetic system.
It is possible to make these theoretical ideas about cognition mathematically rigorous; for
instance, Appendix ?? briefly presents a formal definition of cognitive synergy that has been
analyzed as part of an effort to prove theorems about the importance of cognitive synergy for
giving rise to emergent system properties associated with general intelligence. However, while
we have found such formal analyses valuable for clarifying our designs and understanding their
qualitative properties, we have concluded that, for the present, the best way to explore our
hypotheses about cognitive synergy and human-like general intelligence is empirically – via
building and testing systems like CogPrime.
2.5.1 Achieving Humanlike Intelligence via Cognitive Synergy
Summing up: at the broadest level, there are four primary challenges in constructing an integrative,
cognitive synergy based approach to AGI:
2.5 Integrative and Synergetic Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence 31
1. choosing an overall cognitive architecture that possesses adequate richness and flexibility
for the task of achieving childlike cognition.
2. Choosing appropriate AI algorithms and data structures to fulfill each of the functions
identified in the cognitive architecture (e.g. visual perception, audition, episodic memory,
language generation, analogy,...)
3. Ensuring that these algorithms and structures, within the chosen cognitive architecture,
are able to cooperate in such a way as to provide appropriate coordinated, synergetic
intelligent behavior (a critical aspect since childlike cognition is an integrated functional
response to the world, rather than a loosely coupled collection of capabilities.)
4. Embedding one’s system in an environment that provides sufficiently rich stimuli and
interactions to enable the system to use this cooperation to ongoingly, creatively develop
an intelligent internal world-model and self-model.
We argue that CogPrime
provides a viable way to address these challenges.

Chapter 3
A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
3.1 Introduction
In the last chapter we discussed human intelligence from a fairly down-to-earth perspective,
looking at the particular intelligent functions that human beings carry out in their everyday
lives. And we strongly feel this practical perspective is important: Without this concreteness, it’s
too easy for AGI research to get distracted by appealing (or frightening) abstractions of various
sorts. However, it’s also important to look at the nature of mind and intelligence from a more
general and conceptual perspective, to avoid falling into an approach that follows the particulars
of human capability but ignores the deeper structures and dynamics of mind that ultimately
allow human minds to be so capable. In this chapter we very briefly review some ideas from the
patternist philosophy of mind, a general conceptual framework on intelligence which has
been inspirational for many key aspects of the CogPrime design, and which has been ongoingly
developed by one of the authors (Ben Goertzel) during the last two decades (in a series of
publications beginning in 1991, most recently The Hidden Pattern [Goe06a]). Some of the ideas
described are quite broad and conceptual, and are related to CogPrime only via serving as
general inspirations; others are more concrete and technical, and are actually utilized within
the design itself.
CogPrime is an integrative design formed via the combination of a number of different
philosophical, scientific and engineering ideas. The success or failure of the design doesn’t depend
on any particular philosophical understanding of intelligence. In that sense, the more abstract
notions presented in this chapter should be considered “optional” rather than critical in a
CogPrime context. However, due to the core role patternism has played in the development of
CogPrime, understanding a few things about general patternist philosophy will be helpful for
understanding CogPrime, even for those readers who are not philosophically inclined. Those
readers who are philosophically inclined, on the other hand, are urged to read The Hidden
Pattern and then interpret the particulars of CogPrime in this light.
3.2 Some Patternist Principles
The patternist philosophy of mind is a general approach to thinking about intelligent systems.
It is based on the very simple premise that mind is made of pattern – and that a mind is a
35
36 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
system for recognizing patterns in itself and the world, critically including patterns regarding
which procedures are likely to lead to the achievement of which goals in which contexts.
Pattern as the basis of mind is not in itself is a very novel idea; this concept is present, for
instance, in the 19th-century philosophy of Charles Peirce [Pei34], in the writings of contemporary
philosophers Daniel Dennett [Den91] and Douglas Hofstadter [Hof79, Hof96], in Benjamin
Whorf’s [Who64] linguistic philosophy and Gregory Bateson’s [Bat79] systems theory of mind
and nature. Bateson spoke of the Metapattern: “that it is pattern which connects.” In Goertzel’s
writings on philosophy of mind, an effort has been made to pursue this theme more thoroughly
than has been done before, and to articulate in detail how various aspects of human mind and
mind in general can be well-understood by explicitly adopting a patternist perspective. 1
In the patternist perspective, "pattern" is generally defined as "representation as something
simpler." Thus, for example, if one measures simplicity in terms of bit-count, then a program
compressing an image would be a pattern in that image. But if one uses a simplicity measure
incorporating run-time as well as bit-count, then the compressed version may or may not be a
pattern in the image, depending on how one’s simplicity measure weights the two factors. This
definition encompasses simple repeated patterns, but also much more complex ones. While
pattern theory has typically been elaborated in the context of computational theory, it is not
intrinsically tied to computation; rather, it can be developed in any context where there is a
notion of "representation" or "production" and a way of measuring simplicity. One just needs
to be able to assess the extent to which f represents or produces X, and then to compare the
simplicity of f and X; and then one can assess whether f is a pattern in X. A formalization of
this notion of pattern is given in [Goe06a] and briefly summarized at the end of this chapter.
Next, in patternism the mind of an intelligent system is conceived as the (fuzzy) set of
patterns in that system, and the set of patterns emergent between that system and other
systems with which it interacts. The latter clause means that the patternist perspective is
inclusive of notions of distributed intelligence [Hut96]. Basically, the mind of a system is the
fuzzy set of different simplifying representations of that system that may be adopted.
Intelligence is conceived, similarly to in Marcus Hutter’s [Hut05] recent work (and as elaborated
informally in Chapter 2 above, and formally in Chapter 7 below), as the ability to achieve
complex goals in complex environments; where complexity itself may be defined as the possession
of a rich variety of patterns. A mind is thus a collection of patterns that is associated
with a persistent dynamical process that achieves highly-patterned goals in highly-patterned
environments.
An additional hypothesis made within the patternist philosophy of mind is that reflection is
critical to intelligence. This lets us conceive an intelligent system as a dynamical system that
recognizes patterns in its environment and itself, as part of its quest to achieve complex goals.
While this approach is quite general, it is not vacuous; it gives a particular structure to the
tasks of analyzing and synthesizing intelligent systems. About any would-be intelligent system,
we are led to ask questions such as:
• How are patterns represented in the system? That is, how does the underlying infrastructure
of the system give rise to the displaying of a particular pattern in the system’s behavior?
• What kinds of patterns are most compactly represented within the system?
• What kinds of patterns are most simply learned?
1 In some prior writings the term “psynet model of mind” has been used to refer to the application of patternist
philosophy to cognitive theory, but this term has been "deprecated" in recent publications as it seemed to
introduce more confusion than clarification.
3.2 Some Patternist Principles 37
• What learning processes are utilized for recognizing patterns?
• What mechanisms are used to give the system the ability to introspect (so that it can
recognize patterns in itself)?
Now, these same sorts of questions could be asked if one substituted the word “pattern” with
other words like “knowledge” or “information”. However, we have found that asking these questions
in the context of pattern leads to more productive answers, avoiding unproductive byways
and also tying in very nicely with the details of various existing formalisms and algorithms for
knowledge representation and learning.
Among the many kinds of patterns in intelligent systems, semiotic patterns are particularly
interesting ones. Peirce decomposed these into three categories:
• iconic patterns, which are patterns of contextually important internal similarity between
two entities (e.g. an iconic pattern binds a picture of a person to that person)
• indexical patterns, which are patterns of spatiotemporal co-occurrence (e.g. an indexical
pattern binds a wedding dress and a wedding)
• symbolic patterns, which are patterns indicating that two entities are often involved in
the same relationships (e.g. a symbolic pattern between the number “5” (the symbol) and
various sets of 5 objects (the entities that the symbol is taken to represent))
Of course, some patterns may span more than one of these semiotic categories; and there
are also some patterns that don’t fall neatly into any of these categories. But the semiotic
patterns are particularly important ones; and symbolic patterns have played an especially large
role in the history of AI, because of the radically different approaches different researchers have
taken to handling them in their AI systems. Mathematical logic and related formalisms provide
sophisticated mechanisms for combining and relating symbolic patterns (“symbols”), and some
AI approaches have focused heavily on these, sometimes more so than on the identification of
symbolic patterns in experience or the use of them to achieve practical goals. We will look fairly
carefully at these differences in Chapter 4.
Pursuing the patternist philosophy in detail leads to a variety of particular hypotheses and
conclusions about the nature of mind. Following from the view of intelligence in terms of
achieving complex goals in complex environments, comes a view in which the dynamics of
a cognitive system are understood to be governed by two main forces:
• self-organization, via which system dynamics cause existing system patterns to give rise to
new ones
• goal-oriented behavior, which will be defined more rigorously in Chapter 7, but basically
amounts to a system interacting with its environment in a way that appears like an attempt
to maximize some reasonably simple function
Self-organized and goal-oriented behavior must be understood as cooperative aspects. If an
agent is asked to build a surprising structure out of blocks and does so, this is goal-oriented.
But the agent’s ability to carry out this goal-oriented task will be greater if it has previously
played around with blocks a lot in an unstructured, spontaneous way. And the “nudge toward
creativity” given to it by asking it to build a surprising blocks structure may cause it to explore
some novel patterns, which then feed into its future unstructured blocks play.
Based on these concepts, as argued in detail in [Goe06a], several primary dynamical principles
may be posited, including:
38 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
• Evolution , conceived as a general process via which patterns within a large population
thereof are differentially selected and used as the basis for formation of new patterns, based
on some “fitness function” that is generally tied to the goals of the agent
– Example: If trying to build a blocks structure that will surprise Bob, an agent may
simulate several procedures for building blocks structures in its “mind’s eye”, assessing
for each one the expected degree to which it might surprise Bob. The search through
procedure space could be conducted as a form of evolution, via an algorithm such as
MOSES.
• Autopoiesis: the process by which a system of interrelated patterns maintains its integrity,
via a dynamic in which whenever one of the patterns in the system begins to decrease in
intensity, some of the other patterns increase their intensity in a manner that causes the
troubled pattern to increase in intensity again
– Example: An agent’s set of strategies for building the base of a tower, and its set of
strategies for building the middle part of a tower, are likely to relate autopoietically. If
the system partially forgets how to build the base of a tower, then it may regenerate
this missing knowledge via using its knowledge about how to build the middle part
(i.e., it knows it needs to build the base in a way that will support good middle parts).
Similarly if it partially forgets how to build the middle part, then it may regenerate this
missing knowledge via using its knowledge about how to build the base (i.e. it knows a
good middle part should fit in well with the sorts of base it knows are good).
– This same sort of interdependence occurs between pattern-sets containing more than
two elements
– Sometimes (as in the above example) autopoietic interdependence in the mind is tied
to interdependencies in the physical world, sometimes not.
• Association. Patterns, when given attention, spread some of this attention to other patterns
that they have previously been associated with in some way. Furthermore, there is
Peirce’s law of mind [Pei34], which could be paraphrased in modern terms as stating that
the mind is an associative memory network, whose dynamics dictate that every idea in
the memory is an active agent, continually acting on those ideas with which the memory
associates it.
– Example: Building a blocks structure that resembles a tower, spreads attention to memories
of prior towers the agents has seen, and also to memories of people the agent knows
have seen towers, and structures it has built at the same time as towers, structures that
resemble towers in various respects, etc.
• Differential attention allocation / credit assignment. Patterns that have been valuable
for goal-achievement are given more attention, and are encouraged to participate in
giving rise to new patterns.
– Example: Perhaps in a prior instance of the task “build me a surprising structure out of
blocks,” searching through memory for non-blocks structures that the agent has played
with has proved a useful cognitive strategy. In that case, when the task is posed to the
agent again, it should tend to allocate disproportionate resources to this strategy.
• Pattern creation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are mutated and
combined with each other to yield new patterns.
3.2 Some Patternist Principles 39
– Example: Building towers has been useful in a certain context, but so has building
structures with a large number of triangles. Why not build a tower out of triangles?
Or maybe a vaguely tower-like structure that uses more triangles than a tower easily
could?
– Example: Building an elongated block structure resembling a table was successful in the
past, as was building a structure resembling a very flat version of a chair. Generalizing,
maybe building distorted versions of furniture is good. Or maybe it is building distorted
version of any previously perceived objects that is good. Or maybe both, to different
degrees....
Next, for a variety of reasons outlined in [Goe06a] it becomes appealing to hypothesize that the
network of patterns in an intelligent system must give rise to the following large-scale emergent
structures
• Hierarchical network. Patterns are habitually in relations of control over other patterns that
represent more specialized aspects of themselves.
– Example: The pattern associated with “tall building” has some control over the pattern
associated with “tower”, as the former represents a more general concept ... and “tower”
has some control over “Eiffel tower”, etc.
• Heterarchical network. The system retains a memory of which patterns have previously
been associated with each other in any way.
– Example: “Tower” and “snake” are distant in the natural pattern hierarchy, but may be
associatively/heterarchically linked due to having a common elongated structure. This
heterarchical linkage may be used for many things, e.g. it might inspire the creative
construction of a tower with a snake’s head.
• Dual network. Hierarchical and heterarchical structures are combined, with the dynamics
of the two structures working together harmoniously. Among many possible ways to hierarchically
organize a set of patterns, the one used should be one that causes hierarchically
nearby patterns to have many meaningful heterarchical connections; and of course, there
should be a tendency to search for heterarchical connections among hierarchically nearby
patterns.
– Example: While the set of patterns hierarchically nearby “tower” and the set of patterns
heterarchically nearby “tower” will be quite different, they should still have more overlap
than random pattern-sets of similar sizes. So, if looking for something else heterarchically
near “tower”, using the hierarchical information about “tower” should be of some use,
and vice versa.
– In PLN, hierarchical relationships correspond to Atoms A and B so that InheritanceAB
and InheritanceBA have highly dissimilar strength; and heterarchical relationships correspond
to IntensionalSimilarity relationships. The dual network structure then arises
when intensional and extensional inheritance approximately correlate with each other,
so that inference about either kind of inheritance assists with figuring out about the
other kind.
• Self structure. A portion of the network of patterns forms into an approximate image of the
overall network of patterns.
40 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
– Example: Each time the agent builds a certain structure, it observes itself building
the structure, and its role as “builder of a tall tower” (or whatever the structure is)
becomes part of its self-model. Then when it is asked to build something new, it may
consult its self-model to see if it believes itself capable of building that sort of thing (for
instance, if it is asked to build something very large, its self-model may tell it that it
lacks persistence for such projects, so it may reply “I can try, but I may wind up not
finishing it”).
As we proceed through the CogPrime design in the following pages, we will see how each
of these abstract concepts arises concretely from CogPrime’s structures and algorithms. If the
theory of [Goe06a] is correct, then the success of CogPrime as a design will depend largely on
whether these high-level structures and dynamics can be made to emerge from the synergetic
interaction of CogPrime’s representation and algorithms, when they are utilized to control an
appropriate agent in an appropriate environment.
3.3 Cognitive Synergy
Now we dig a little deeper and present a different sort of “general principle of feasible general
intelligence”, already hinted in earlier chapters: the cognitive synergy principle 2 , which is both
a conceptual hypothesis about the structure of generally intelligent systems in certain classes of
environments, and a design principle used to guide the design of CogPrime. Chapter 8 presents
a mathematical formalization of the notion of cognitive synergy; here we present the conceptual
idea informally, which makes it more easily digestible but also more vague-sounding.
We will focus here on cognitive synergy specifically in the case of “multi-memory systems,”
which we define as intelligent systems whose combination of environment, embodiment and
motivational system make it important for them to possess memories that divide into partially
but not wholly distinct components corresponding to the categories of:
• Declarative memory
– Examples of declarative knowledge: Towers on average are taller than buildings. I generally
am better at building structures I imagine, than at imitating structures I’m shown
in pictures.
• Procedural memory (memory about how to do certain things)
– Examples of procedural knowledge: Practical know-how regarding how to pick up an
elongated rectangular block, or a square one. Know-how regarding when to approach
a problem by asking “What would one of my teachers do in this situation” versus by
thinking through the problem from first principles.
• Sensory and episodic memory
– Example of sensory knowledge: memory of Bob’s face; memory of what a specific tall
blocks tower looked like
2 While these points are implicit in the theory of mind given in [Goe06a], they are not articulated in this
specific form there. So the material presented in this section is a new development within patternist philosophy,
developed since [Goe06a] in a series of conference papers such as [Goe09a].
3.3 Cognitive Synergy 41
– Example of episodic knowledge: memory of the situation in which the agent first met
Bob; memory of a situation in which a specific tall blocks tower was built
• Attentional memory (knowledge about what to pay attention to in what contexts)
– Example of attentional knowledge: When involved with a new person, it’s useful to pay
attention to whatever that person looks at
• Intentional memory (knowledge about the system’s own goals and subgoals)
– Example of intentional knowledge: If my goal is to please some person whom I don’t
know that well, then a subgoal may be figuring out what makes that person smile.
In Chapter 9 below we present a detailed argument as to how the requirement for a multimemory
underpinning for general intelligence emerges from certain underlying assumptions
regarding the measurement of the simplicity of goals and environments. Specifically we argue
that each of these memory types corresponds to certain modes of communication, so that intelligent
agents which have to efficiently handle a sufficient variety of types of communication with
other agents, are going to have to handle all these types of memory. These types of communication
overlap and are often used together, which implies that the different memories and their
associated cognitive processes need to work together. The points made in this section do not
rely on that argument regarding the relation of multiple memory types to the environmental
situation of multiple communication types. What they do rely on is the assumption that, in
the intelligence agent in question, the different components of memory are significantly but not
wholly distinct. That is, there are significant “family resemblances” between the memories of a
single type, yet there are also thoroughgoing connections between memories of different types.
Repeating the above points in a slightly more organized manner and then extending them, the
essential idea of cognitive synergy, in the context of multi-memory systems, may be expressed
in terms of the following points
1. Intelligence, relative to a certain set of environments, may be understood as the capability
to achieve complex goals in these environments.
2. With respect to certain classes of goals and environments, an intelligent system requires a
“multi-memory” architecture, meaning the possession of a number of specialized yet interconnected
knowledge types, including: declarative, procedural, attentional, sensory, episodic
and intentional (goal-related). These knowledge types may be viewed as different sorts of
patterns that a system recognizes in itself and its environment.
3. Such a system must possess knowledge creation (i.e. pattern recognition / formation) mechanisms
corresponding to each of these memory types. These mechanisms are also called
“cognitive processes.”
4. Each of these cognitive processes, to be effective, must have the capability to recognize when
it lacks the information to perform effectively on its own; and in this case, to dynamically
and interactively draw information from knowledge creation mechanisms dealing with other
types of knowledge
5. This cross-mechanism interaction must have the result of enabling the knowledge creation
mechanisms to perform much more effectively in combination than they would if operated
non-interactively. This is “cognitive synergy.”
Interactions as mentioned in Points 4 and 5 in the above list are the real conceptual meat
of the cognitive synergy idea. One way to express the key idea here, in an AI context, is that
42 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
most AI algorithms suffer from combinatorial explosions: the number of possible elements to
be combined in a synthesis or analysis is just too great, and the algorithms are unable to
filter through all the possibilities, given the lack of intrinsic constraint that comes along with
a “general intelligence” context (as opposed to a narrow-AI problem like chess-playing, where
the context is constrained and hence restricts the scope of possible combinations that needs
to be considered). In an AGI architecture based on cognitive synergy, the different learning
mechanisms must be designed specifically to interact in such a way as to palliate each others’
combinatorial explosions - so that, for instance, each learning mechanism dealing with a certain
sort of knowledge, must synergize with learning mechanisms dealing with the other sorts of
knowledge, in a way that decreases the severity of combinatorial explosion.
One prerequisite for cognitive synergy to work is that each learning mechanism must recognize
when it is “stuck,” meaning it’s in a situation where it has inadequate information to
make a confident judgment about what steps to take next. Then, when it does recognize that
it’s stuck, it may request help from other, complementary cognitive mechanisms.
3.4 The General Structure of Cognitive Dynamics: Analysis and
Synthesis
We have discussed the need for synergetic interrelation between cognitive processes corresponding
to different types of memory ... and the general high-level cognitive dynamics that a mind
must possess (evolution, autopoiesis). The next step is to dig further into the nature of the cognitive
processes associated with different memory types and how they give rise to the needed
high-level cognitive dynamics. In this section we present a general theory of cognitive processes
based on a decomposition of cognitive processes into the two categories of analysis and synthesis,
and a general formulation of each of these categories 3 .
Specifically we focus here on what we call focused cognitive processes; that is, cognitive
processes that selectively focus attention on a subset of the patterns making up a mind. In
general these are not the only kind, there may also be global cognitive processes that act on
every pattern in a mind. An example of a global cognitive process in CogPrime is the basic
attention allocation process, which spreads “importance” among all knowledge in the system’s
memory. Global cognitive processes are also important, but focused cognitive processes are
subtler to understand which is why we spend more time on them here.
3.4.1 Component-Systems and Self-Generating Systems
We begin with autopoesis – and, more specifically, with the concept of a “component-system”,
as described in George Kampis’s book Self-Modifying Systems in Biology and Cognitive Science
[Kam91], and as modified into the concept of a “self-generating system” or SGS in Goertzel’s
book Chaotic Logic [Goe94]. Roughly speaking, a Kampis-style component-system consists of
a set of components that combine with each other to form other compound components. The
3 While these points are highly compatible with theory of mind given in [Goe06a], they are not articulated there.
The material presented in this section is a new development within patternist philosophy, presented previously
only in the article [GPPG06].
3.4 The General Structure of Cognitive Dynamics: Analysis and Synthesis 43
metaphor Kampis uses is that of Lego blocks, combining to form bigger Lego structures. Compound
structures may in turn be combined together to form yet bigger compound structures.
A self-generating system is basically the same concept as a component-system, but understood
to be computable, whereas Kampis claims that component-systems are uncomputable.
Next, in SGS theory there is also a notion of reduction (not present in the Lego metaphor):
sometimes when components are combined in a certain way, a “reaction” happens, which may
lead to the elimination of some of the components. One relevant metaphor here is chemistry.
Another is abstract algebra: for instance, if we combine a component f with its “inverse” component
f −1 , both components are eliminated. Thus, we may think about two stages in the
interaction of sets of components: combination, and reduction. Reduction may be thought of
as algebraic simplification, governed by a set of rules that apply to a newly created compound
component, based on the components that are assembled within it.
Formally, suppose C 1 , C 2 , ... is the set of components present in a discrete-time componentsystem
at time t. Then, the components present at time t+1 are a subset of the set of components
of the form
Reduce(Join(C i (1), ..., C i (r)))
where Join is a joining operation, and Reduce is a reduction operator. The joining operation
is assumed to map tuples of components into components, and the reduction operator is assumed
to map the space of components into itself. Of course, the specific nature of a component system
is totally dependent on the particular definitions of the reduction and joining operators; in
following chapters we will specify these for the CogPrime system, but for the purpose of the
broader theoretical discussion in this section they may be left general.
What is called the “cognitive equation” in Chaotic Logic [Goe94] is the case of a SGS where
the patterns in the system at time t have a tendency to correspond to components of the system
at future times t + s. So, part of the action of the system is to transform implicit knowledge
(patterns among system components) into explicit knowledge (specific system components). We
will see one version of this phenomenon in Chapter 14 where we model implicit knowledge using
mathematical structures called “derived hypergraphs”; and we will also later review several ways
in which CogPrime’s dynamics explicitly encourage cognitive-equation type dynamics, e.g.:
• inference, which takes conclusions implicit in the combination of logical relationships, and
makes them implicit by deriving new logical relationships from them
• map formation, which takes concepts that have often been active together, and creates new
concepts grouping them
• association learning, which creates links representing patterns of association between entities
• probabilistic procedure learning, which creates new models embodying patterns regarding
which procedures tend to perform well according to particular fitness functions
3.4.2 Analysis and Synthesis
Now we move on to the main point of this section: the argument that all or nearly all focused
cognitive processes are expressible using two general process-schemata we call synthesis and
44 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
analysis 4 . The notion of “focused cognitive process” will be exemplified more thoroughly below,
but in essence what is meant is a cognitive process that begins with a small number of items
(drawn from memory) as its focus, and has as its goal discovering something about these
items, or discovering something about something else in the context of these items or in a way
strongly biased by these items. This is different from a global cognitive process whose goal is
more broadly-based and explicitly involves all or a large percentage of the knowledge in an
intelligent system’s memory store.
Among the focused cognitive processes are those governed by the so-called cognitive schematic
implication
Context ∧ P rocedure → Goal
where the Context involves sensory, episodic and/or declarative knowledge; and attentional
knowledge is used to regulate how much resource is given to each such schematic implication in
memory. Synergy among the learning processes dealing with the context, the procedure and the
goal is critical to the adequate execution of the cognitive schematic using feasible computational
resources. This sort of explicitly goal-driven cognition plays a significant though not necessarily
dominant role in CogPrime, and is also related to production rules systems and other traditional
AI systems, as will be articulated in Chapter 4.
The synthesis and analysis processes as we conceive them, in the general framework of SGS
theory, are as follows. First, synthesis, as shown in Figure 3.1, is defined as
synthesis: Iteratively build compounds from the initial component pool using the combinators,
greedily seeking compounds that seem likely to achieve the goal.
Or in more detail:
1. Begin with some initial components (the initial “current pool”), an additional set of components
identified as “combinators” (combination operators), and a goal function
2. Combine the components in the current pool, utilizing the combinators, to form product
components in various ways, carrying out reductions as appropriate, and calculating relevant
quantities associated with components as needed
3. Select the product components that seem most promising according to the goal function,
and add these to the current pool (or else simply define these as the current pool)
4. Return to Step 2
And analysis, as shown in Figure 3.2, is defined as
analysis: Iteratively search (the system’s long-term memory) for component-sets that combine
using the combinators to form the initial component pool (or subsets thereof), greedily
seeking component-sets that seem likely to achieve the goal
or in more detail:
1. Begin with some components (the initial “current pool”) and a goal function
2. Seek components so that, if one combines them to form product components using the
combinators and then performs appropriate reductions, one obtains (as many as possible
of) the components in the current pool
4 In [GPPG06], what is here called “analysis” was called “backward synthesis”, a name which has some advantages
since it indicated that what’s happening is a form of creation; but here we have opted for the more traditional
analysis/synthesis terminology
3.4 The General Structure of Cognitive Dynamics: Analysis and Synthesis 45
Fig. 3.1: The General Process of Synthesis
3. Use the newly found constructions of the components in the current pool, to update the
quantitative properties of the components in the current pool, and also (via the current
pool) the quantitative properties of the components in the initial pool
4. Out of the components found in Step 2, select the ones that seem most promising according
to the goal function, and add these to the current pool (or else simply define these as the
current pool)
5. Return to Step 2
More formally, synthesis may be specified as follows. Let X denote the set of combinators,
and let Y 0 denote the initial pool of components (the initial focus of the cognitive process).
Given Y i , let Z i denote the set
Reduce(Join(C i (1), ..., C i (r)))
where the C i are drawn from Y i or from X. We may then say
Y i+1 = F ilter(Z i )
where F ilter is a function that selects a subset of its arguments.
Analysis, on the other hand, begins with a set W of components, and a set X of combinators,
and tries to find a series Y i so that according to the process of synthesis, Y n =W .
In practice, of course, the implementation of a synthesis process need not involve the explicit
construction of the full set Z i . Rather, the filtering operation takes place implicitly during the
construction of Y i+1 . The result, however, is that one gets some subset of the compounds producible
via joining and reduction from the set of components present in Y i plus the combinators
X.
46 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
Fig. 3.2: The General Process of Analysis
Conceptually one may view synthesis as a very generic sort of “growth process,” and analysis
as a very generic sort of “figuring out how to grow something.” The intuitive idea underlying
the present proposal is that these forward-going and backward-going “growth processes” are
among the essential foundations of cognitive control, and that a conceptually sound design for
cognitive control should explicitly make use of this fact. To abstract away from the details,
what these processes are about is:
• taking the general dynamic of compound-formation and reduction as outlined in Kampis
and Chaotic Logic
• introducing goal-directed pruning (“filtering”) into this dynamic so as to account for the
limitations of computational resources that are a necessary part of pragmatic intelligence
3.4.3 The Dynamic of Iterative Analysis and Synthesis
While synthesis and analysis are both very useful on their own, they achieve their greatest power
when harnessed together. It is my hypothesis that the dynamic pattern of alternating synthesis
and analysis has a fundamental role in cognition. Put simply, synthesis creates new mental
forms by combining existing ones. Then, analysis seeks simple explanations for the forms in the
mind, including the newly created ones; and, this explanation itself then comprises additional
new forms in the mind, to be used as fodder for the next round of synthesis. Or, to put it yet
more simply:
3.4 The General Structure of Cognitive Dynamics: Analysis and Synthesis 47
⇒ Combine ⇒ Explain ⇒ Combine ⇒ Explain ⇒ Combine ⇒
It is not hard to express this alternating dynamic more formally, as well.
• Let X denote any set of components.
• Let F(X) denote a set of components which is the result of synthesis on X.
• Let B(X) denote a set of components which is the result of analysis of X. We assume also
a heuristic biasing the synthesis process toward simple constructs.
• Let S(t) denote a set of components at time t, representing part of a system’s knowledge
base.
• Let I(t) denote components resulting from the external environment at time t.
Then, we may consider a dynamical iteration of the form
S(t + 1) = B(F (S(t) + I(t)))
This expresses the notion of alternating synthesis and analysis formally, as a dynamical
iteration on the space of sets of components. We may then speak about attractors of this
iteration: fixed points, limit cycles and strange attractors. One of the key hypotheses I wish
to put forward here is that some key emergent cognitive structures are strange attractors of
this equation. The iterative dynamic of combination and explanation leads to the emergence
of certain complex structures that are, in essence, maintained when one recombines their parts
and then seeks to explain the recombinations. These structures are built in the first place
through iterative recombination and explanation, and then survive in the mind because they
are conserved by this process. They then ongoingly guide the construction and destruction of
various other temporary mental structures that are not so conserved.
3.4.4 Self and Focused Attention as Approximate Attractors of the
Dynamic of Iterated Forward-Analysis
As noted above, patternist philosophy argues that two key aspects of intelligence are emergent
structures that may be called the “self” and the “attentional focus.” These, it is suggested, are
aspects of intelligence that may not effectively be wired into the infrastructure of an intelligent
system, though of course the infrastructure may be configured in such a way as to encourage
their emergence. Rather, these aspects, by their nature, are only likely to be effective if they
emerge from the cooperative activity of various cognitive processes acting within a broad base
of knowledge.
Above we have described the pattern of ongoing habitual oscillation between synthesis and
analysis as a kind of “dynamical iteration.” Here we will argue that both self and attentional
focus may be viewed as strange attractors of this iteration. The mode of argument is relatively
informal. The essential processes under consideration are ones that are poorly understood from
an empirical perspective, due to the extreme difficulty involved in studying them experimentally.
For understanding self and attentional focus, we are stuck in large part with introspection, which
is famously unreliable in some contexts, yet still dramatically better than having no information
at all. So, the philosophical perspective on self and attentional focus given here is a synthesis of
empirical and introspective notions, drawn largely from the published thinking and research of
48 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
others but with a few original twists. From a CogPrime perspective, its use has been to guide
the design process, to provide a grounding for what otherwise would have been fairly arbitrary
choices.
3.4.4.1 Self
Another high-level intelligent system pattern mentioned above is the “self”, which we here will tie
in with analysis and synthesis processes. The term “self” as used here refers to the “phenomenal
self” [Met04] or “self-model”. That is, the self is the model that a system builds internally,
reflecting the patterns observed in the (external and internal) world that directly pertain to
the system itself. As is well known in everyday human life, self-models need not be completely
accurate to be useful; and in the presence of certain psychological factors, a more accurate
self-model may not necessarily be advantageous. But a self-model that is too badly inaccurate
will lead to a badly-functioning system that is unable to effectively act toward the achievement
of its own goals.
The value of a self-model for any intelligent system carrying out embodied agentive cognition
is obvious. And beyond this, another primary use of the self is as a foundation for metaphors
and analogies in various domains. Patterns recognized pertaining to the self are analogically
extended to other entities. In some cases this leads to conceptual pathologies, such as the anthropomorphization
of trees, rocks and other such objects that one sees in some precivilized
cultures. But in other cases this kind of analogy leads to robust sorts of reasoning - for instance,
in reading Lakoff and Nunez’s [LN00] intriguing explorations of the cognitive foundations of
mathematics, it is pretty easy to see that most of the metaphors on which they hypothesize
mathematics to be based, are grounded in the mind’s conceptualization of itself as a spatiotemporally
embedded entity, which in turn is predicated on the mind’s having a conceptualization
of itself (a self) in the first place.
A self-model can in many cases form a self-fulfilling prophecy (to make an obvious doubleentendre’!).
Actions are generated based on one’s model of what sorts of actions one can and/or
should take; and the results of these actions are then incorporated into one’s self-model. If a
self-model proves a generally bad guide to action selection, this may never be discovered, unless
said self-model includes the knowledge that semi-random experimentation is often useful.
In what sense, then, may it be said that self is an attractor of iterated analysis? Analysis
infers the self from observations of system behavior. The system asks: What kind of system
might I be, in order to give rise to these behaviors that I observe myself carrying out? Based
on asking itself this question, it constructs a model of itself, i.e. it constructs a self. Then, this
self guides the system’s behavior: it builds new logical relationships its self-model and various
other entities, in order to guide its future actions oriented toward achieving its goals. Based on
the behaviors newly induced via this constructive, forward-synthesis activity, the system may
then engage in analysis again and ask: What must I be now, in order to have carried out these
new actions? And so on.
Our hypothesis is that after repeated iterations of this sort, in infancy, finally during early
childhood a kind of self-reinforcing attractor occurs, and we have a self-model that is resilient
and doesn’t change dramatically when new instances of action- or explanation-generation occur.
This is not strictly a mathematical attractor, though, because over a long period of time the self
may well shift significantly. But, for a mature self, many hundreds of thousands or millions of
forward-analysis cycles may occur before the self-model is dramatically modified. For relatively
3.4 The General Structure of Cognitive Dynamics: Analysis and Synthesis 49
long periods of time, small changes within the context of the existing self may suffice to allow
the system to control itself intelligently.
Humans can also develop what are known as subselves [Row90]. A subself is a partially
autonomous self-network focused on particular tasks, environments or interactions. It contains
a unique model of the whole organism, and generally has its own set of episodic memories,
consisting of memories of those intervals during which it was the primary dynamic mode controlling
the organism. One common example is the creative subself – the subpersonality that
takes over when a creative person launches into the process of creating something. In these
times, a whole different personality sometimes emerges, with a different sort of relationship
to the world. Among other factors, creativity requires a certain open-ness that is not always
productive in an everyday life context, so it’s natural for the self-system of a highly creative
person to bifurcate into one self-system for everyday life, and another for the protected context
of creative activity. This sort of phenomenon might emerge naturally in CogPrime systems as
well if they were exposed to appropriate environments and social situations.
Finally, it is interesting to speculate regarding how self may differ in future AI systems as
opposed to in humans. The relative stability we see in human selves may not exist in AI systems
that can self-improve and change more fundamentally and rapidly than humans can. There may
be a situation in which, as soon as a system has understood itself decently, it radically modifies
itself and hence violates its existing self-model. Thus: intelligence without a long-term stable self.
In this case the “attractor-ish” nature of the self holds only over much shorter time scales than
for human minds or human-like minds. But the alternating process of synthesis and analysis
for self-construction is still critical, even though no reasonably stable self-constituting attractor
ever emerges. The psychology of such intelligent systems will almost surely be beyond human
beings’ capacity for comprehension and empathy.
3.4.4.2 Attentional Focus
Finally, we turn to the notion of an “attentional focus” similar to Baars’ [Baa97] notion of a
Global Workspace, which will be reviewed in more detail in Chapter 4: a collection of mental
entities that are, at a given moment, receiving far more than the usual share of an intelligent
system’s computational resources. Due to the amount of attention paid to items in the attentional
focus, at any given moment these items are in large part driving the cognitive processes
going on elsewhere in the mind as well - because the cognitive processes acting on the items in
the attentional focus are often involved in other mental items, not in attentional focus, as well
(and sometimes this results in pulling these other items into attentional focus). An intelligent
system must constantly shift its attentional focus from one set of entities to another based on
changes in its environment and based on its own shifting discoveries.
In the human mind, there is a self-reinforcing dynamic pertaining to the collection of entities
in the attentional focus at any given point in time, resulting from the observation that: If A
is in the attentional focus, and A and B have often been associated in the past, then odds
are increased that B will soon be in the attentional focus. This basic observation has been
refined tremendously via a large body of cognitive psychology work; and neurologically it follows
not only from Hebb’s [Heb49] classic work on neural reinforcement learning, but also from
numerous more modern refinements [SB98]. But it implies that two items A and B, if both in
the attentional focus, can reinforce each others’ presence in the attentional focus, hence forming
a kind of conspiracy to keep each other in the limelight. But of course, this kind of dynamic
50 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
must be counteracted by a pragmatic tendency to remove items from the attentional focus if
giving them attention is not providing sufficient utility in terms of the achievement of system
goals.
The synthesis and analysis perspective provides a more systematic perspective on this selfreinforcing
dynamic. Synthesis occurs in the attentional focus when two or more items in the
focus are combined to form new items, new relationships, new ideas. This happens continually,
as one of the main purposes of the attentional focus is combinational. On the other hand,
Analysis then occurs when a combination that has been speculatively formed is then linked
in with the remainder of the mind (the “unconscious”, the vast body of knowledge that is not
in the attentional focus at the given moment in time). Analysis basically checks to see what
support the new combination has within the existing knowledge store of the system. Thus,
forward-analysis basically comes down to “generate and test”, where the testing takes the form
of attempting to integrate the generated structures with the ideas in the unconscious longterm
memory. One of the most obvious examples of this kind of dynamic is creative thinking
(Boden, 2003; Goertzel, 1997), where the attentional focus continually combinationally creates
new ideas, which are then tested via checking which ones can be validated in terms of (built up
from) existing knowledge.
The analysis stage may result in items being pushed out of the attentional focus, to be
replaced by others. Likewise may the synthesis stage: the combinations may overshadow and
then replace the things combined. However, in human minds and functional AI minds, the
attentional focus will not be a complete chaos with constant turnover: Sometimes the same set of
ideas – or a shifting set of ideas within the same overall family of ideas – will remain in focus for a
while. When this occurs it is because this set or family of ideas forms an approximate attractor
for the dynamics of the attentional focus, in particular for the forward-analysis dynamic of
speculative combination and integrative explanation. Often, for instance, a small “core set” of
ideas will remain in the attentional focus for a while, but will not exhaust the attentional focus:
the rest of the attentional focus will then, at any point in time, be occupied with other ideas
related to the ones in the core set. Often this may mean that, for a while, the whole of the
attentional focus will move around quasi-randomly through a “strange attractor” consisting of
the set of ideas related to those in the core set.
3.4.5 Conclusion
The ideas presented above (the notions of synthesis and analysis, and the hypothesis of self and
attentional focus as attractors of the iterative forward-analysis dynamic) are quite generic and
are hypothetically proposed to be applicable to any cognitive system, natural or artificial. Later
chapters will discuss the manifestation of the above ideas in the context of CogPrime. We have
found that the analysis/synthesis approach is a valuable tool for conceptualizing CogPrime’s
cognitive dynamics, and we conjecture that a similar utility may be found more generally.
Next, so as not to end the section on too blasé of a note, we will also make a stronger
hypothesis: that, in order for a physical or software system to achieve intelligence that is roughly
human-level in both capability and generality, using computational resources on the same order
of magnitude as the human brain, this system must
• manifest the dynamic of iterated synthesis and analysis, as modes of an underlying “selfgenerating
system” dynamic
3.5 Perspectives on Machine Consciousness 51
• do so in such a way as to lead to self and attentional focus as emergent structures that serve
as approximate attractors of this dynamic, over time periods that are long relative to the
basic “cognitive cycle time” of the system’s forward-analysis dynamics
To prove the truth of a hypothesis of this nature would seem to require mathematics fairly
far beyond anything that currently exists. Nonetheless, however, we feel it is important to
formulate and discuss such hypotheses, so as to point the way for future investigations both
theoretical and pragmatic.
3.5 Perspectives on Machine Consciousness
Finally, we can’t let a chapter on philosophy – even a brief one – end without some discussion
of the thorniest topic in the philosophy of mind: consciousness. Rather than seeking to resolve
or comprehensively review this most delicate issue, we will restrict ourselves to giving it in
Appendix ?? an overview of many of the common views on the subject; and here in the main text
discussing the relationship between consciousness theory and patternist philosophy of cognition,
the practical work of designing and building AGI.
One fairly concrete idea about consciousness, that relates closely to certain aspects of the
CogPrime design, is that the subjective experience of being conscious of some entity X, is correlated
with the presence of a very intense pattern in one’s overall mind-state, corresponding to X.
This simple idea is also the essence of neuroscientist Susan Greenfield’s theory of consciousness
[Gre01] (but in her theory, "overall mind-state" is replaced with "brain-state"), and has much
deeper historical roots in philosophy of mind which we shall not venture to unravel here.
This observation relates to the idea of "moving bubbles of awareness" in intelligent systems.
If an intelligent system consists of multiple processing or data elements, and during each (sufficiently
long) interval of time some of these elements get much more attention than others,
then one may view the system as having a certain "attentional focus" during each interval. The
attentional focus is itself a significant pattern in the system (the pattern being "these elements
habitually get more processor and memory", roughly speaking). As the attentional focus shifts
over time one has a "moving bubble of pattern" which then corresponds experientially to a
"moving bubble of awareness."
This notion of a "moving bubble of awareness" ties in very closely to global workspace
theory [Baa97] (briefly mentioned above), a cognitive theory that has broad support from
neuroscience and cognitive science and has also served as the motivation for Stan Franklin’s
LIDA AI system [BF09], to be discussed in Chapter ??. The global workspace theory views the
mind as consisting of a large population of small, specialized processes – a society of agents.
These agents organize themselves into coalitions, and coalitions that are relevant to contextually
novel phenomena, or contextually important goals, are pulled into the global workspace (which
is identified with consciousness). This workspace broadcasts the message of the coalition to all
the unconscious agents, and recruits other agents into consciousness. Various sorts of contexts
– e.g. goal contexts, perceptual contexts, conceptual contexts and cultural contexts – play a
role in determining which coalitions are relevant, and form the unconscious "background" of
the conscious global workspace. New perceptions are often, but not necessarily, pushed into the
workspace. Some of the agents in the global workspace are concerned with action selection, i.e.
with controlling and passing parameters to a population of possible actions. The contents of
the workspace at any given time have a certain cohesiveness and interdependency, the so-called
52 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
"unity of consciousness." In essence the contents of the global workspace form a moving bubble
of attention or awareness.
In CogPrime, this moving bubble is achieved largely via economic attention network (ECAN)
equations [GPI + 10] that propagate virtual currency between nodes and links representing elements
of memories, so that the attentional focus consists of the wealthiest nodes and links.
Figures 3.3 and 3.4 illustrate the existence and flow of attentional focus in OpenCog. On the
other hand, in Hameroff’s recent model of the brain [Ham10], the brain’s moving bubble of
attention is achieved through dendro-dendritic connections and the emergent dendritic web.
Fig. 3.3: Graphical depiction of the momentary bubble of attention in the memory of an
OpenCog AI system. Circles and lines represent nodes and links in OpenCogPrimes memory,
and stars denote those nodes with a high level of attention (represented in OpenCog by
the ShortTermImportance node variable) at the particular point in time.
In this perspective, self, free will and reflective consciousness are specific phenomena occurring
within the moving bubble of awareness. They are specific ways of experiencing awareness,
corresponding to certain abstract types of physical structures and dynamics, which we shall
endeavor to identify in detail in Appendix ??.

OpenCog AI system, a few moments after the bubble shown in Figure 3.3, indicating the moving
of the bubble of attention. Depictive conventions are the same as in Figure 1. This shows
an idealized situation where the declarative knowledge remains invariant from one moment to
the next but only the focus of attention shifts. In reality both will evolve together.
3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern
Finally, before winding up our very brief tour through patternist philosophy of mind, we will
briefly visit patternism’s more formal side. Many of the key aspects of patternism have been
rigorously formalized. Here we give only a few very basic elements of the relevant mathematics,
which will be used later on in the exposition of CogPrime. (Specifically, the formal definition of
pattern emerges in the CogPrime design in the definition of a fitness function for “pattern mining”
algorithms and Occam-based concept creation algorithms, and the definition of intensional
inheritance within PLN.)
We give some definitions, drawn from Appendix 1 of [Goe06a]:
Definition 1 Given a metric space (M, d), and two functions c : M → [0, ∞] (the “simplicity
measure”) and F : M → M (the “production relationship”), we say that P ∈ M is a pattern
in X ∈ M to the degree
54 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind
ι P X =
((
1 −
d(F (P), X)
c(X)
) c(X) − c(P)
c(X)
This degree is called the pattern intensity of P in X. It quantifies the extent to which P
is a pattern in X. Supposing that F (P) = X, then the first factor in the definition equals 1,
and we are left with only the second term, which measures the degree of compression obtained
via representing X as the result of P rather than simply representing X directly. The greater
the compression ratio obtained via using P to represent X, the greater the intensity of P as a
pattern in X. The first time, in the case F (P) ≠ X, adjusts the pattern intensity downwards to
account for the amount of error with which F (P) approximates ≠ X. If one holds the second
factor fixed and thinks about varying the first factor, then: The greater the error, the lossier
the compression, and the lower the pattern intensity.
For instance, if one wishes one may take c to denote algorithmic information measured on
some reference Turing machine, and F (X) to denote what appears on the second tape of a
two-tape Turing machine t time-steps after placing X on its first tape. Other more naturalistic
computational models are also possible here and are discussed extensively in Appendix 1 of
[Goe06a].
) +
Definition 2 The structure of X ∈ M is the fuzzy set St X
function
χ StX (P) = ι P X
defined via the membership
This lets us formalize our definition of “mind” alluded to above: the mind of X as the set
of patterns associated with X. We can formalize this, for instance, by considering P to belong
to the mind of X if it is a pattern in some Y that includes X. There are then two numbers
to look at: ι P X and P (Y |X) (the percentage of Y that is also contained in X). To define the
degree to which P belongs to the mind of X we can then combine these two numbers using
some function f that is monotone increasing in both arguments. This highlights the somewhat
arbitrary semantics of “of” in the phrase “the mind of X.” Which of the patterns binding X to
its environment are part of X’s mind, and which are part of the world? This isn’t necessarily
a good question, and the answer seems to depend on what perspective you choose, represented
formally in the present framework by what combination function f you choose (for instance if
f(a, b) = a r b 2−r then it depends on the choice of 0 < r < 1).
Next, we can formalize the notion of a “pattern space” by positing a metric on patterns, thus
making pattern space a metric space, which will come in handy in some places in later chapters:
Definition 3 Assuming M is a countable space, the structural distance is a metric d St
defined on M via
d St (X, Y ) = T (χ StX , χ StY )
where T is the Tanimoto distance.
The Tanimoto distance between two real vectors A and B is defined as
T (A, B) =
A · B
‖A‖ 2 + ‖B‖ 2 − A · B
and since M is countable this can be applied to fuzzy sets such as St X via considering the
latter as vectors. (As an aside, this can be generalized to uncountable M as well, but we will
not require this here.)
3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern 55
Using this definition of pattern, combined with the formal theory of intelligence given in
Chapter 7, one may formalize the various hypotheses made in the previous section, regarding
the emergence of different kinds of networks and structures as patterns in intelligent systems.
However, it appears quite difficult to prove the formal versions of these hypotheses given current
mathematical tools, which renders such formalizations of limited use.
Finally, consider the case where the metric space M has a partial ordering < on it; we may
then define
Definition 3.1. R ∈ M is a subpattern in X ∈ M to the degree
∫
κ R P∈M
X =
true(R < P )dιP X
∫
P∈M dιP X
This degree is called the subpattern intensity of P in X.
Roughly speaking, the subpattern intensity measures the percentage of patterns in X that
contain R (where "containment" is judged by the partial ordering <). But the percentage is
measured using a weighted average, where each pattern is weighted by its intensity as a pattern
in X. A subpattern may or may not be a pattern on its own. A nonpattern that happens to
occur within many patterns may be an intense subpattern.
Whether the subpatterns in X are to be considered part of the "mind" of X is a somewhat
superfluous question of semantics. Here we choose to extend the definition of mind given in
[Goe06a] to include subpatterns as well as patterns, because this makes it simpler to describe
the relationship between hypersets and minds, as we will do in Appendix ??.

Chapter 4
Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
4.1 Introduction
While we believe CogPrime is the most thorough attempt at an architecture for advanced AGI,
to date, we certainly recognize there have been many valuable attempts in the past with similar
aims; and we also have great respect for other AGI efforts occurring in parallel with Cog-
Prime development, based on alternative, sometimes overlapping, theoretical presuppositions
and practical choices. In most of this book we will ignore these other current and historical
efforts except where they are directly useful for CogPrime – there are many literature reviews
already published, and this is a research treatise not a textbook. In this chapter, however, we
will break from this pattern and give a rough high-level overview of the various AGI architectures
at play in the field today. The overview definitely has a bias toward other work with
some direct relevance to CogPrime, but not an overwhelming bias; we also discuss a number of
approaches that are unrelated to, and even in some cases conceptually orthogonal to, our own.
CogPrime builds on prior AI efforts in a variety of ways. Most of the specific algorithms
and structures in CogPrime have their roots in prior AI work; and in addition, the CogPrime
cognitive architecture has been heavily inspired by some other holistic cognitive architectures,
especially (but not exclusively) MicroPsi [Bac09], LIDA [BF09] and DeSTIN [ARK09a, ARC09].
In this chapter we will briefly review some existing cognitive architectures, with especial but
not exclusive emphasis on the latter three.
We will articulate some rough mappings between elements of these other architectures and
elements of CogPrime – some in this chapter, and some in Chapter 5. However, these mappings
will mostly be left informal and very incompletely specified. The articulation of detailed interarchitecture
mappings is an important project, but would be a substantial additional project
going well beyond the scope of this book. We will not give a thorough review of the similarities
and differences between CogPrime and each of these architectures, but only mention some of
the highlights.
The reader desiring a more thorough review of cognitive architectures is referred to Wlodek
Duch’s review paper from the AGI-08 conference [DOP08]; and also to Alexei Samsonovich’s
review paper [Sam10], which compares a number of cognitive architectures in terms of a feature
checklist, and was created collaboratively with the creators of the architectures.
Duch, in his survey of cognitive architectures [DOP08], divides existing approaches into three
paradigms – symbolic, emergentist and hybrid – as broadly indicated in Figure 4.1. Drawing on
his survey and updating slightly, we give here some key examples of each, and then explain why
57
58 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
CogPrime represents a significantly more effective approach to embodied human-like general
intelligence. In our treatment of emergentist architectures, we pay particular attention to developmental
robotics architectures, which share considerably with CogPrime in terms of underlying
philosophy, but differ via not integrating a symbolic “language and inference” component such
as CogPrime includes.
In brief, we believe that the hybrid approach is the most pragmatic one given the current state
of AI technology, but that the emergentist approach gets something fundamentally right, by
focusing on the emergence of complex dynamics and structures from the interactions of simple
components. So CogPrime is a hybrid architecture which (according to the cognitive synergy
principle) binds its components together very tightly dynamically, allowing the emergence of
complex dynamics and structures in the integrated system. Most other hybrid architectures are
less tightly coupled and hence seem ill-suited to give rise to the needed emergent complexity. The
other hybrid architectures that do possess the needed tight coupling, such as MicroPsi [Bac09],
strike us as underdeveloped and founded on insufficiently powerful learning algorithms.
Fig. 4.1: Duch’s simplified taxonomy of cognitive architectures. CogPrime falls into the “hybrid”
category, but differs from other hybrid architectures in its focus on synergetic interactions
between components and their potential to give rise to appropriate system-wide emergent structures
enabling general intelligence.
4.2 Symbolic Cognitive Architectures
A venerable tradition in AI focuses on the physical symbol system hypothesis [New90], which
states that minds exist mainly to manipulate symbols that represent aspects of the world or
themselves. A physical symbol system has the ability to input, output, store and alter symbolic
entities, and to execute appropriate actions in order to reach its goals. Generally, symbolic
cognitive architectures focus on “working memory” that draws on long-term memory as needed,
and utilize a centralized control over perception, cognition and action. Although in principle
such architectures could be arbitrarily capable (since symbolic systems have universal repre-
4.2 Symbolic Cognitive Architectures 59
sentational and computational power, in theory), in practice symbolic architectures tend to be
weak in learning, creativity, procedure learning, and episodic and associative memory. Decades
of work in this tradition have not resolved these issues, which has led many researchers to
explore other options. A few of the more important symbolic cognitive architectures are:
• SOAR [LRN87], a classic example of expert rule-based cognitive architecture designed to
model general intelligence. It has recently been extended to handle sensorimotor functions,
though in a somewhat cognitively unnatural way; and is not yet strong in areas such as
episodic memory, creativity, handling uncertain knowledge, and reinforcement learning.
• ACT-R [AL03] is fundamentally a symbolic system, but Duch classifies it as a hybrid system
because it incorporates connectionist-style activation spreading in a significant role; and
there is an experimental thoroughly connectionist implementation to complement the primary
mainly-symbolic implementation. Its combination of SOAR-style “production rules”
with large-scale connectionist dynamics allows it to simulate a variety of human psychological
phenomena, but abstract reasoning, creativity and transfer learning are still missing.
• EPIC [RCK01], a cognitive architecture aimed at capturing human perceptual, cognitive
and motor activities through several interconnected processors working in parallel. The
system is controlled by production rules for cognitive processors and a set of perceptual
(visual, auditory, tactile) and motor processors operating on symbolically coded features
rather than raw sensory data. It has been connected to SOAR for problem solving, planning
and learning,
• ICARUS [Lan05], an integrated cognitive architecture for physical agents, with knowledge
specified in the form of reactive skills, each denoting goal-relevant reactions to a class of
problems. The architecture includes a number of modules: a perceptual system, a planning
system, an execution system, and several memory systems. Concurrent processing is absent,
attention allocation is fairly crude, and uncertain knowledge is not thoroughly handled.
• SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) [SE07] is a logic, frame and network-based
knowledge representation, reasoning, and acting system that has undergone over three
decades of development. While it has been used for some interesting prototype experiments
in language processing and virtual agent control, it has not yet been used for any
large-scale or real-world application.
• Cyc [LG90] is an AGI architecture based on predicate logic as a knowledge representation,
and using logical reasoning techniques to answer questions and derive new knowledge from
old. It has been connected to a natural language engine, and designs have been created
for the connection of Cyc with Albus’s 4D-RCS [AM01]. Cyc’s most unique aspect is the
large database of commonsense knowledge that Cycorp has accumulated (millions of pieces
of knowledge, entered by specially trained humans in predicate logic format); part of the
philosophy underlying Cyc is that once a sufficient quantity of knowledge is accumulated in
the knowledge base, the problem of creating human-level general intelligence will become
much less difficult due to the ability to leverage this knowledge.
While these architectures contain many valuable ideas and have yielded some interesting results,
we feel they are incapable on their own of giving rise to the emergent structures and dynamics
required to yield humanlike general intelligence using feasible computational resources. However,
we are more sanguine about the possibility of ideas and components from symbolic architectures
playing a role in human-level AGI via incorporation in hybrid architectures.
We now review a few symbolic architectures in slightly more detail.
60 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
4.2.1 SOAR
The cognitive architectures best known among AI academics are probably Soar and ACT-R,
both of which are explicitly being developed with the dual goals of creating human-level AGI
and modeling all aspects of human psychology. Neither the Soar nor ACT-R communities feel
themselves particularly near these long-term goals, yet they do take them seriously.
Soar is based on IF-THEN rules, otherwise known as “production rules.” On the surface this
makes it similar to old-style expert systems, but Soar is much more than an expert system; it’s
at minimum a sophisticated problem-solving engine. Soar explicitly conceives problem solving
as a search through solution space for a “goal state” representing a (precise or approximate)
problem solution. It uses a methodology of incremental search, where each step is supposed to
move the system a little closer to its problem-solving goal, and each step involves a potentially
complex “decision cycle.”
In the simplest case, the decision cycle has two phases:
• Gathering appropriate information from the system’s long-term memory (LTM) into its
working memory (WM)
• A decision procedure that uses the gathered information to decide an action
If the knowledge available in LTM isn’t enough to solve the problem, then the decision
procedure invokes search heuristics like hill-climbing, which try to create new knowledge (new
production rules) that will help move the system closer to a solution. If a solution is found by
chaining together multiple production rules, then a chunking mechanism is used to combine
these rules together into a single rule for future use. One could view the chunking mechanism
as a way of converting explicit knowledge into implicit knowledge, similar to “map formation”
in CogPrime (see Chapter 42 of Part 2), but in the current Soar design and implementation it
is a fairly crude mechanism.
In recent years Soar has acquired a number of additional methods and modalities, including
some visual reasoning methods and some mechanisms for handling episodic and procedural
knowledge. These expand the scope of the system but the basic production rule and chunking
mechanisms as briefly described above remain the core “cognitive algorithm” of the system.
From a CogPrime perspective, what Soar offers is certainly valuable, e.g.
• heuristics for transferring knowledge from LTM into WM
• chaining and chunking of implications
• methods for interfacing between other forms of knowledge and implications
However, a very short and very partial list of the major differences between Soar and Cog-
Prime would include
• CogPrime contains a variety of other core cognitive mechanisms beyond the management
and chunking of implications
• the variety of “chunking” type methods in CogPrime goes far beyond the sort of localized
chunking done in Soar
• CogPrime is committed to representing uncertainty at the base level whereas Soar’s production
rules are crisp
• The mechanisms for LTM-WM interaction are rather different in CogPrime, being based
on complex nonlinear dynamics as represented in Economic Attention Allocation (ECAN)
• Currently Soar does not contain creativity-focused heuristics like blending or evolutionary
learning in its core cognitive dynamic.
4.2 Symbolic Cognitive Architectures 61
4.2.2 ACT-R
In the grand scope of cognitive architectures, ACT-R is quite similar to Soar, but there are
many micro-level differences. ACT-R is defined in terms of declarative and procedural knowledge,
where procedural knowledge takes the form of Soar-like production rules, and declarative
knowledge takes the form of chunks. It contains a variety of mechanisms for learning new rules
and chunks from old; and also contains sophisticated probabilistic equations for updating the
activation levels associated with items of knowledge (these equations being roughly analogous
in function to, though quite different from, the ECAN equations in CogPrime).
Figure 4.2 displays the current architecture of ACT-R. The flow of cognition in the system is
in response to the current goal, currently active information from declarative memory, information
attended to in perceptual modules (vision and audition are implemented), and the current
state of motor modules (hand and speech are implemented). The early work with ACT-R was
based on comparing system performance to human behavior, using only behavioral measures,
such as the timing of keystrokes or patterns of eye movements. Using such measures, it was not
possible to test detailed assumptions about which modules were active in the performance of
a task. More recently the ACT-R community has been engaged in a process of using imaging
data to provide converging data on module activity. Figure 4.3 illustrates the associations they
have made between the modules in Figure 4.2 and brain regions. Coordination among all of
these components occurs through actions of the procedural module, which is mapped to the
basal ganglia.
Fig. 4.2: High-level architecture of ACT-R
In practice ACT-R, even more so than Soar, seems to be used more as a programming
framework for cognitive modeling than as an AI system. One can fairly easily use ACT-R
to program models of specific human mental behaviors, which may then be matched against
62 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
Fig. 4.3: Conjectured Mapping Between ACT-R and the Brain
psychological data. Opinions differ as to whether this sort of modeling is valuable for achieving
AGI goals. CogPrime is not designed to support this kind of modeling, as it intentionally does
many things very differently from humans.
ACT-R in its original form did not say much about perceptual and motor operations, but
recent versions have incorporated EPIC, an independent cognitive architecture focused on modeling
these aspects of human behavior.
4.2.3 Cyc and Texai
Our review of cognitive architectures would be incomplete without mentioning Cyc [LG90],
one of the best known and best funded AGI-oriented projects in history. While the main focus
of the Cyc project has been on the hand-coding of large amounts of declarative knowledge,
there is also a cognitive architecture of sorts there. The center of Cyc is an engine for logical
deduction, acting on knowledge represented in predicate logic. A natural language engine has
been associated with the logic engine, which enables one to ask English questions and get
English replies.
Stephen Reed, while an engineer at Cycorp, designed a perceptual-motor front end for Cyc
based on James Albus’ Reference Model Architecture; the ensuing system, called Cognitive-
Cyc, would have been the first full-fledged cognitive architecture based on Cyc, but was not
implemented. Reed left Cycorp and is now building a system called Texai, which has many
similarities to Cyc (and relies upon the OpenCyc knowledge base, a subset of Cyc’s overall
knowledge base), but incorporates a CognitiveCyc style cognitive architecture.
4.2 Symbolic Cognitive Architectures 63
4.2.4 NARS
Pei Wang’s NARS logic [Wan06] played a large role in the development of PLN, CogPrime’s
uncertain logic component, a relationship that is discussed in depth in [GMIH08] and won’t
be re-emphasized here. However, NARS is more than just an uncertain logic, it is also an
overall cognitive architecture (which is centered on NARS logic, but also includes other aspects).
CogPrime bears little relation to NARS except in the specific similarities between PLN logic
and NARS logic, but, the other aspects of NARS are worth briefly recounting here.
NARS is formulated as a system for processing tasks, where a task consists of a question or a
piece of new knowledge. The architecture is focused on declarative knowledge, but some pieces
of knowledge may be associated with executable procedures, which allows NARS to carry out
control activities (in roughly the same way that a Prolog program can).
At any given time a NARS system contains
• working memory: a small set of tasks which are active, kept for a short time, and closely
related to new questions and new knowledge
• long-term memory: a huge set of knowledge which is passive, kept for a long time, and not
necessarily related to current questions and knowledge
The working and long term memory spaces of NARS may each be thought of as a set of
chunks, where each chunk consists of a set of tasks and a set of knowledge. NARS’s basic
cognitive process is:
1. choose a chunk
2. choose a task from that chunk
3. choose a piece of knowledge from that chunk
4. use the task and knowledge to do inference
5. send the new tasks to corresponding chunks
Depending on the nature of the task and knowledge, the inference involved may be one of
the following:
• if the task is a question, and the knowledge happens to be an answer to the question, a
copy of the knowledge is generated as a new task
• backward inference
• revision (merging two pieces of knowledge with the same form but different truth value)
• forward inference
• execution of a procedure associated with a piece of knowledge
Unlike many other systems, NARS doesn’t decide what type of inference is used to process
a task when the task is accepted, but works in a data-driven way – that is, it is the task and
knowledge that dynamically determine what type of inference will be carried out
The “choice” processes mentioned above are done via assigning relative priorities to
• chunks (where they are called activity)
• tasks (where they are called urgency)
• knowledge (where they are called importance)
64 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
and then distributing the system’s resources accordingly, based on a probabilistic algorithm.
(It’s interesting to note that while NARS uses probability theory as part of its control mechanism,
the logic it uses to represent its own knowledge about the world is nonprobabilistic. This
is considered conceptually consistent, in the context of NARS theory, because system control
is viewed as a domain where the system’s knowledge is more complete, thus more amenable to
probabilistic reasoning.)
4.2.5 GLAIR and SNePS
Another logic-focused cognitive architecture, very different from NARS in detail, is Stuart
Shapiro’s GLAIR cognitive architecture, which is centered on the SNePS paraconsistent logic
[SE07].
Like NARS, the core “cognitive loop” of GLAIR is based on reasoning: either thinking about
some percept (e.g. linguistic input, or sense data from the virtual or physical world), or answering
some question. This inference based cognition process is turned into an intelligent agent
control process via coupling it with an acting component, which operates according to a set of
policies, each one of which tells the system when to take certain internal or external actions
(including internal reasoning actions) in response to its observed internal and external situation.
GLAIR contains multiple layers:
• the Knowledge Layer (KL), which contains the beliefs of the agent, and is where reasoning,
planning, and act selection are performed
• the Sensori-Actuator Layer (SAL), contains the controllers of the sensors and effectors of
the hardware or software robot.
• the Perceptuo-Motor Layer (PML), which grounds the KL symbols in perceptual structures
and subconscious actions, contains various registers for providing the agent’s sense of situatedness
in the environment, and handles translation and communication between the KL
and the SAL.
The logical Knowledge Layer incorporates multiple memory types using a common representation
(including declarative, procedural, episodic, attentional and intentional knowledge, and
meta-knowledge). To support this broad range of knowledge types, a broad range of logical inference
mechanisms are used, so that the KL may be variously viewed as predicate logic based,
frame based, semantic network based, or from other perspectives.
What makes GLAIR more robust than most logic based AI approaches is the novel paraconsistent
logical formalism used in the knowledge base, which means (among other things)
that uncertain, speculative or erroneous knowledge may exist in the system’s memory without
leading the system to create a broadly erroneous view of the world or carry out egregiously
unintelligent actions. CogPrime is not thoroughly logic-focused like GLAIR is, but in its logical
aspect it seeks a similar robustness through its use of PLN logic, which embodies properties
related to paraconsistency.
Compared to CogPrime, we see that GLAIR has a similarly integrative approach, but that
the integration of different sorts of cognition is done more strictly within the framework of
logical knowledge representation.
4.3 Emergentist Cognitive Architectures 65
4.3 Emergentist Cognitive Architectures
Another species of cognitive architecture expects abstract symbolic processing to emerge from
lower-level “subsymbolic” dynamics, which sometimes (but not always) are designed to simulate
neural networks or other aspects of human brain function. These architectures are typically
strong at recognizing patterns in high-dimensional data, reinforcement learning and associative
memory; but no one has yet shown how to achieve high-level functions such as abstract reasoning
or complex language processing using a purely subsymbolic approach. A few of the more
important subsymbolic, emergentist cognitive architectures are:
• DeSTIN [ARK09a, ARC09], which is part of CogPrime, may also be considered as an
autonomous AGI architecture, in which case it is emergentist and contains mechanisms
to encourage language, high-level reasoning and other abstract aspects of intelligent to
emerge from hierarchical pattern recognition and related self-organizing network dynamics.
In CogPrime DeSTIN is used as part of a hybrid architecture, which greatly reduces the
reliance on DeSTIN’s emergent properties.
• Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) [HB06] is a hierarchical temporal pattern
recognition architecture, presented as both an AI approach and a model of the cortex. So
far it has been used exclusively for vision processing and we will discuss its shortcomings
later in the context of our treatment of DeSTIN.
• SAL [JL08], based on the earlier and related IBCA (Integrated Biologically-based Cognitive
Architecture) is a large-scale emergent architecture that seeks to model distributed
information processing in the brain, especially the posterior and frontal cortex and the
hippocampus. So far the architectures in this lineage have been used to simulate various
human psychological and psycholinguistic behaviors, but haven’t been shown to give rise to
higher-level behaviors like reasoning or subgoaling.
• NOMAD (Neurally Organized Mobile Adaptive Device) automata and its successors
[KE06] are based on Edelman’s “Neural Darwinism” model of the brain, and feature large
numbers of simulated neurons evolving by natural selection into configurations that carry
out sensorimotor and categorization tasks. The emergence of higher-level cognition from
this approach seems rather unlikely.
• Ben Kuipers and his colleagues [MK07, MK08, MK09]have pursued an extremely innovative
research program which combines qualitative reasoning and reinforcement learning to enable
an intelligent agent to learn how to act, perceive and model the world. Kuipers’ notion of
“bootstrap learning” involves allowing the robot to learn almost everything about its world,
including for instance the structure of 3D space and other things that humans and other
animals obtain via their genetic endowments. Compared to Kuipers’ approach, CogPrime
falls in line with most other approaches which provide more “hard-wired” structure, following
the analogy to biological organisms that are born with more innate biases.
There is also a set of emergentist architectures focused specifically on developmental robotics,
which we will review below in a separate subsection, as all of these share certain common
characteristics.
Our general perspective on the emergentist approach is that it is philosophically correct
but currently pragmatically inadequate. Eventually, some emergentist approach could surely
succeed at giving rise to humanlike general intelligence – the human brain, after all, is plainly
an emergentist system. However, we currently lack understanding of how the brain gives rise
to abstract reasoning and complex language, and none of the existing emergentist systems
66 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
seem remotely capable of giving rise to such phenomena. It seems to us that the creation of
a successful emergentist AGI will have to wait for either a detailed understanding of how the
brain gives rise to abstract thought, or a much more thorough mathematical understanding of
the dynamics of complex self-organizing systems.
The concept of cognitive synergy is more relevant to emergentist than to symbolic architectures.
In a complex emergentist architecture with multiple specialized components, much of
the emergence is expected to arise via synergy between different richly interacting components.
Symbolic systems, at least in the forms currently seen in the literature, seem less likely to give
rise to cognitive synergy as their dynamics tend to be simpler. And hybrid systems, as we shall
see, are somewhat diverse in this regard: some rely heavily on cognitive synergies and others
consist of more loosely coupled components.
We now review the DeSTIN emergentist architecture in more detail, and then turn to the
developmental robotics architectures.
4.3.1 DeSTIN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to AGI
The DeSTIN architecture, created by Itamar Arel and his colleagues, addresses the problem
of general intelligence using hierarchical spatiotemporal networks designed to enable scalable
perception, state inference and reinforcement-learning-guided action in real-world environments.
DeSTIN has been developed with the plan of gradually extending it into a complete system for
humanoid robot control, founded on the same qualitative information-processing principles as
the human brain (though without striving for detailed biological realism). However, the practical
work with DeSTIN to date has focused on visual and auditory processing; and in the context of
the present proposal, the intention is to utilize DeSTIN for perception and actuation oriented
processing, hybridizing it with CogPrime which will handle abstract cognition and language.
Here we will discuss DeSTIN primarily in the perception context, only briefly mentioning the
application to actuation which is conceptually similar.
In DeSTIN (see Figure 4.4), perception is carried out by a deep spatiotemporal inference
network, which is connected to a similarly architected critic network that provides feedback on
the inference network’s performance, and an action network that controls actuators based on the
activity in the inference network (Figure 4.5 depicts a standard action hierarchy, of which the
hierarchy in DeSTIN is an example). The nodes in these networks perform probabilistic pattern
recognition according to algorithms to be described below; and the nodes in each of the networks
may receive states of nodes in the other networks as inputs, providing rich interconnectivity
and synergetic dynamics.
4.3.1.1 Deep versus Shallow Learning for Perceptual Data Processing
The most critical feature of DeSTIN is its uniquely robust approach to modeling the world
based on perceptual data. Mimicking the efficiency and robustness by which the human brain
analyzes and represents information has been a core challenge in AI research for decades. For
instance, humans are exposed to massive amounts of visual and auditory data every second
of every day, and are somehow able to capture critical aspects of it in a way that allows for
appropriate future recollection and action selection. For decades, it has been known that the
4.3 Emergentist Cognitive Architectures 67
Fig. 4.4: High-level architecture of DeSTIN
brain is a massively parallel fabric, in which computation processes and memory storage are
highly distributed. But massive parallelism is not in itself a solution – one also needs the right
architecture; which DeSTIN provides, building on prior work in the area of deep learning.
Humanlike intelligence is heavily adapted to the physical environments in which humans
evolved; and one key aspect of sensory data coming from our physical environments is its
hierarchical structure. However, most machine learning and pattern recognition systems are
“shallow” in structure, not explicitly incorporating the hierarchical structure of the world in
their architecture. In the context of perceptual data processing, the practical result of this is
the need to couple each shallow learner with a pre-processing stage, wherein high-dimensional
sensory signals are reduced to a lower-dimension feature space that can be understood by the
shallow learner. The hierarchical structure of the world is thus crudely captured in the hierarchy
of “preprocessor plus shallow learner.” In this sort of approach, much of the intelligence of the
system shifts to the feature extraction process, which is often imperfect and always applicationdomain
specific.
Deep machine learning has emerged as a more promising framework for dealing with complex,
high-dimensional real-world data. Deep learning systems possess a hierarchical structure that
intrinsically biases them to recognize the hierarchical patterns present in real-world data. Thus,
they hierarchically form a feature space that is driven by regularities in the observations, rather
than by hand-crafted techniques. They also offer robustness to many of the distortions and
transformations that characterize real-world signals, such as noise, displacement, scaling, etc.
Deep belief networks [HOT06] and Convolutional Neural Networks [LBDE90] have been
demonstrated to successfully address pattern inference in high dimensional data (e.g. images).
They owe their success to their underlying paradigm of partitioning large data structures into
smaller, more manageable units, and discovering the dependencies that may or may not exist
68 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
Fig. 4.5: A standard, general-purpose hierarchical control architecture. DeSTIN’s control hierarchy
exemplifies this architecture, with the difference lying mainly in the DeSTIN control
hierarchy’s tight integration with the state inference (perception) and critic (reinforcement)
hierarchies.
between such units. However, this paradigm has its limitations; for instance, these approaches
do not represent temporal information with the same ease as spatial structure. Moreover, some
key constraints are imposed on the learning schemes driving these architectures, namely the
need for layer-by-layer training, and oftentimes pre-training. DeSTIN overcomes the limitations
of prior deep learning approaches to perception processing, and also extends beyond perception
to action and reinforcement learning.
4.3.1.2 DeSTIN for Perception Processing
The hierarchical architecture of DeSTIN’s spatiotemporal inference network comprises an arrangement
into multiple layers of “nodes” comprising multiple instantiations of an identical
cortical circuit. Each node corresponds to a particular spatiotemporal region, and uses a statistical
learning algorithm to characterize the sequences of patterns that are presented to it by
nodes in the layer beneath it. More specifically,
• At the very lowest layer of the hierarchy nodes receive as input raw data (e.g. pixels of an
image) and continuously construct a belief state that attempts to characterize the sequences
of patterns viewed.
4.3 Emergentist Cognitive Architectures 69
• The second layer, and all those above it, receive as input the belief states of nodes at their
corresponding lower layers, and attempt to construct belief states that capture regularities
in their inputs.
• Each node also receives as input the belief state of the node above it in the hierarchy (which
constitutes “contextual” information)
Fig. 4.6: Small-scale instantiation of the DeSTIN perceptual hierarchy. Each box represents a
node, which corresponds to a spatiotemporal region (nodes higher in the hierarchy corresponding
to larger regions). O denotes the current observation in the region, C is the state of the higherlayer
node, and S and S ′ denote state variables pertaining to two subsequent time steps. In
each node, a statistical learning algorithm is used to predict subsequent states based on prior
states, current observations, and the state of the higher-layer node.
More specifically, each of the DeSTIN nodes, referring to a specific spacetime region, contains
a set of state variables conceived as clusters, each corresponding to a set of previously-observed
sequences of events. These clusters are characterized by centroids (and are hence assumed
roughly spherical in shape), and each of them comprises a certain "spatiotemporal form" recognized
by the system in that region. Each node then contains the task of predicting the likelihood
of a certain centroid being most apropos in the near future, based on the past history of observations
in the node. This prediction may be done by simple probability tabulation, or via
70 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
application of supervised learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. These clustering
and prediction processes occur separately in each node, but the nodes are linked together
via bidirectional dynamics: each node feeds input to its parents, and receives "advice" from its
parents that is used to condition its probability calculations in a contextual way.
These processes are executed formally by the following basic belief update rule, which governs
the learning process and is identical for every node in the architecture. The belief state is a
probability mass function over the sequences of stimuli that the nodes learns to represent.
Consequently, each node is allocated a predefined number of state variables each denoting a
dynamic pattern, or sequence, that is autonomously learned. The DeSTIN update rule maps
the current observation (o), belief state (b), and the belief state of a higher-layer node or context
(c), to a new (updated) belief state (b ′ ), such that
alternatively expressed as
b ′ (s ′ ) = Pr (s ′ |o, b, c) = Pr (s′ ∩ o ∩ b ∩ c)
, (4.1)
Pr (o ∩ b ∩ c)
b ′ (s ′ ) = Pr(o|s′ , b, c) Pr (s ′ |b, c) Pr (b, c)
. (4.2)
Pr (o|b, c) Pr (b, c)
Under the assumption that observations depend only on the true state, or Pr(o|s ′ , b, c) =
Pr(o|s ′ ), we can further simplify the expression such that
b ′ (s ′ ) = Pr(o|s′ ) Pr (s ′ |b, c)
, (4.3)
Pr (o|b, c)
where Pr (s ′ |b, c) = ∑ Pr (s ′ |s, c) b (s), yielding the belief update rule
s∈S
b ′ (s ′ ) =
Pr (o|s ′ ) ∑ Pr (s ′ |s, c) b (s)
s∈S
∑
Pr (o|s ′′ ) ∑ Pr (s ′′ |s, c) b (s) , (4.4)
s ′′ ∈S
where S denotes the sequence set (i.e. belief dimension) such that the denominator term is a
normalization factor.
One interpretation of eq. (4.4) would be that the static pattern similarity metric, Pr (o|s ′ ) ,
is modulated by a construct that reflects the system dynamics, Pr (s ′ |s, c). As such, the belief
state inherently captures both spatial and temporal information. In our implementation, the
belief state of the parent node, c, is chosen using the selection rule
s∈S
c = arg max b p (s), (4.5)
s
where b p is the belief distribution of the parent node.
A close look at eq. (4.4) reveals that there are two core constructs to be learned, Pr(o|s ′ )
and Pr(s ′ |s, c). In the current DeSTIN design, the former is learned via online clustering while
the latter is learned based on experience by inductively learning a rule that predicts the next
state s ′ given the prior state s and c.
The overall result is a robust framework that autonomously (i.e. with no human engineered
pre-processing of any type) learns to represent complex data patterns, and thus serves the
4.3 Emergentist Cognitive Architectures 71
critical role of building and maintaining a model of the state of the world. In a vision processing
context, for example, it allows for powerful unsupervised classification. If shown a variety of
real-world scenes, it will automatically form internal structures corresponding to the various
natural categories of objects shown in the scenes, such as trees, chairs, people, etc.; and also
the various natural categories of events it sees, such as reaching, pointing, falling. And, as will
be discussed below, it can use feedback from DeSTIN’s action and critic networks to further
shape its internal world-representation based on reinforcement signals.
Benefits of DeSTIN for Perception Processing
DeSTIN’s perceptual network offers multiple key attributes that render it more powerful than
other deep machine learning approaches to sensory data processing:
1. The belief space that is formed across the layers of the perceptual network inherently
captures both spatial and temporal regularities in the data. Given that many applications
require that temporal information be discovered for robust inference, this is a key advantage
over existing schemes.
2. Spatiotemporal regularities in the observations are captured in a coherent manner (rather
than being represented via two separate mechanisms)
3. All processing is both top-down and bottom-up, and both hierarchical and heterarchical,
based on nonlinear feedback connections directing activity and modulating learning in multiple
directions through DeSTIN’s cortical circuits
4. Support for multi-modal fusing is intrinsic within the framework, yielding a powerful state
inference system for real-world, partially-observable settings.
5. Each node is identical, which makes it easy to map the design to massively parallel platforms,
such as graphics processing units.
Points 2-4 in the above list describe how DeSTIN’s perceptual network displays its own
“cognitive synergy” in a way that fits naturally into the overall synergetic dynamics of the overall
CogPrime architecture. Using this cognitive synergy, DeSTIN’s perceptual network addresses
a key aspect of general intelligence: the ability to robustly infer the state of the world, with
which the system interacts, in an accurate and timely manner.
4.3.1.3 DeSTIN for Action and Control
DeSTIN’s perceptual network performs unsupervised world-modeling, which is a critical aspect
of intelligence but of course is not the whole story. DeSTIN’s action network, coupled with the
perceptual network, orchestrates actuator commands into complex movements, but also carries
out other functions that are more cognitive in nature.
For instance, people learn to distinguish between cups and bowls in part via hearing other
people describe some objects as cups and others as bowls. To emulate this kind of learning,
DeSTIN’s critic network provides positive or negative reinforcement signals based on whether
the action network has correctly identified a given object as a cup or a bowl, and this signal
then impacts the nodes in the action network. The critic network takes a simple external “degree
of success or failure” signal and turns it into multiple reinforcement signals to be fed into the
multiple layers of the action network. The result is that the action network self-organizes so
72 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
as to include an implicit “cup versus bowl” classifier, whose inputs are the outputs of some of
the nodes in the higher levels of the perceptual network. This classifier belongs in the action
network because it is part of the procedure by which the DeSTIN system carries out the action
of identifying an object as a cup or a bowl.
This example illustrates how the learning of complex concepts and procedures is divided
fluidly between the perceptual network, which builds a model of the world in an unsupervised
way, and the action network, which learns how to respond to the world in a manner that will
receive positive reinforcement from the critic network.
4.3.2 Developmental Robotics Architectures
A particular subset of emergentist cognitive architectures are sufficiently important that we
consider them separately here: these are developmental robotics architectures, focused on controlling
robots without significant “hard-wiring” of knowledge or capabilities, allowing robots
to learn (and learn how to learn, etc.) via their engagement with the world. A significant focus
is often placed here on “intrinsic motivation,” wherein the robot explores the world guided by
internal goals like novelty or curiosity, forming a model of the world as it goes along, based
on the modeling requirements implied by its goals. Many of the foundations of this research
area were laid by Juergen Schmidhuber’s work in the 1990s [Sch91b, Sch91a, Sch95, Sch02], but
now with more powerful computers and robots the area is leading to more impressive practical
demonstrations.
We mention here a handful of the important initiatives in this area:
• Juyang Weng’s Dav [HZT + 02] and SAIL [WHZ + 00] projects involve mobile robots that
explore their environments autonomously, and learn to carry out simple tasks by building up
their own world-representations through both unsupervised and teacher-driven processing
of high-dimensional sensorimotor data. The underlying philosophy is based on human child
development [WH06], the knowledge representations involved are neural network based,
and a number of novel learning algorithms are involved, especially in the area of vision
processing.
• FLOWERS [BO09], an initiative at the French research institute INRIA, led by Pierre-
Yves Oudeyer, is also based on a principle of trying to reconstruct the processes of development
of the human child’s mind, spontaneously driven by intrinsic motivations. Kaplan
[Kap08] has taken this project in a direction closely related to our own via the creation
of a “robot playroom.” Experiential language learning has also been a focus of the project
[OK06], driven by innovations in speech understanding.
• IM-CLEVER 1 , a new European project coordinated by Gianluca Baldassarre and conducted
by a large team of researchers at different institutions, is focused on creating software
enabling an iCub [MSV + 08] humanoid robot to explore the environment and learn to carry
out human childlike behaviors based on its own intrinsic motivations. As this project is the
closest to our own we will discuss it in more depth below.
Like CogPrime, IM-CLEVER is a humanoid robot intelligence architecture guided by intrinsic
motivations, and using hierarchical architectures for reinforcement learning and sensory ab-

4.4 Hybrid Cognitive Architectures 73
straction. IM-CLEVER’s motivational structure is based in part on Schmidhuber’s informationtheoretic
model of curiosity [Sch06]; and CogPrime’s Psi-based motivational structure utilizes
probabilistic measures of novelty, which are mathematically related to Schmidhuber’s measures.
On the other hand, IM-CLEVER’s use of reinforcement learning follows Schmidhuber’s
earlier work RL for cognitive robotics [BS04, BZGS06], Barto’s work on intrinsically motivated
reinforcement learning [SB06, SM05], and Lee’s [LMC07b, LMC07a] work on developmental
reinforcement learning; whereas CogPrime’s assemblage of learning algorithms is more diverse,
including probabilistic logic, concept blending and other symbolic methods (in the OCP component)
as well as more conventional reinforcement learning methods (in the DeSTIN component).
In many respects IM-CLEVER bears a moderately strong resemblance to DeSTIN, whose
integration with CogPrime is discussed in Chapter 26 of Part 2 (although IM-CLEVER has
much more focus on biological realism than DeSTIN). Apart from numerous technical differences,
the really big distinction between IM-CLEVER and CogPrime is that in the latter we
are proposing to hybridize a hierarchical-abstraction/reinforcement-learning system (such as
DeSTIN) with a more abstract symbolic cognition engine that explicitly handles probabilistic
logic and language. IM-CLEVER lacks the aspect of hybridization with a symbolic system, taking
more of a pure emergentist strategy. Like DeSTIN considered as a standalone architecture
IM-CLEVER does entail a high degree of cognitive synergy, between components dealing with
perception, world-modeling, action and motivation. However, the “emergentist versus hybrid”
is a large qualitative difference between the two approaches.
In all, while we largely agree with the philosophy underlying developmental robotics, our
intuition is that the learning and representational mechanisms underlying the current systems
in this area are probably not powerful enough to lead to human child level intelligence. We
expect that these systems will develop interesting behaviors but fall short of robust preschool
level competency, especially in areas like language and reasoning where symbolic systems have
typically proved more effective. This intuition is what impels us to pursue a hybrid approach,
such as CogPrime. But we do feel that eventually, once the mechanisms underlying brains are
better understood and robotic bodies are richer in sensation and more adept in actuation, some
sort of emergentist, developmental-robotics approach can be successful at creating humanlike,
human-level AGI.
4.4 Hybrid Cognitive Architectures
In response to the complementary strengths and weaknesses of the symbolic and emergentist
approaches, in recent years a number of researchers have turned to integrative, hybrid architectures,
which combine subsystems operating according to the two different paradigms. The
combination may be done in many different ways, e.g. connection of a large symbolic subsystem
with a large subsymbolic system, or the creation of a population of small agents each of which
is both symbolic and subsymbolic in nature.
Nils Nilsson expressed the motivation for hybrid AGI systems very clearly in his article at
the AI-50 conference (which celebrated the 50’th anniversary of the AI field) [Nil09]. While
affirming the value of the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis that underlies symbolic AI, he
argues that “the PSSH explicitly assumes that, whenever necessary, symbols will be grounded
in objects in the environment through the perceptual and effector capabilities of a physical
symbol system.” Thus, he continues,
74 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
“I grant the need for non-symbolic processes in some intelligent systems, but I think they supplement
rather than replace symbol systems. I know of no examples of reasoning, understanding
language, or generating complex plans that are best understood as being performed by systems
using exclusively non-symbolic processes....
AI systems that achieve human-level intelligence will involve a combination of symbolic and
non-symbolic processing.”
A few of the more important hybrid cognitive architectures are:
• CLARION [SZ04] is a hybrid architecture that combines a symbolic component for reasoning
on “explicit knowledge” with a connectionist component for managing “implicit knowledge.”
Learning of implicit knowledge may be done via neural net, reinforcement learning,
or other methods. The integration of symbolic and subsymbolic methods is powerful, but a
great deal is still missing such as episodic knowledge and learning and creativity. Learning
in the symbolic and subsymbolic portions is carried out separately rather than dynamically
coupled, minimizing “cognitive synergy” effects.
• DUAL [NK04] is the most impressive system to come out of Marvin Minsky’s “Society of
Mind” paradigm. It features a population of agents, each of which combines symbolic and
connectionist representation, self-organizing to collectively carry out tasks such as perception,
analogy and associative memory. The approach seems innovative and promising, but
it is unclear how the approach will scale to high-dimensional data or complex reasoning
problems due to the lack of a more structured high-level cognitive architecture.
• LIDA [BF09] is a comprehensive cognitive architecture heavily based on Bernard Baars’
“Global Workspace Theory”. It articulates a “cognitive cycle” integrating various forms of
memory and intelligent processing in a single processing loop. The architecture ties in well
with both neuroscience and cognitive psychology, but it deals most thoroughly with “lower
level” aspects of intelligence, handling more advanced aspects like language and reasoning
only somewhat sketchily. There is a clear mapping between LIDA structures and processes
and corresponding structures and processing in OCP; so that it’s only a mild stretch to view
CogPrime as an instantiation of the general LIDA approach that extends further both in
the lower level (to enable robot action and sensation via DeSTIN) and the higher level (to
enable advanced language and reasoning via OCP mechanisms that have no direct LIDA
analogues).
• MicroPsi [Bac09] is an integrative architecture based on Dietrich Dorner’s Psi model of motivation,
emotion and intelligence. It has been tested on some practical control applications,
and also on simulating artificial agents in a simple virtual world. MicroPsi’s comprehensiveness
and basis in neuroscience and psychology are impressive, but in the current version
of MicroPsi, learning and reasoning are carried out by algorithms that seem unlikely to
scale. OCP incorporates the Psi model for motivation and emotion, so that MicroPsi and
CogPrime may be considered very closely related systems. But similar to LIDA, MicroPsi
currently focuses on the “lower level” aspects of intelligence, not yet directly handling advanced
processes like language and abstract reasoning.
• PolyScheme [Cas07] integrates multiple methods of representation, reasoning and inference
schemes for general problem solving. Each Polyscheme “specialist” models a different
aspect of the world using specific representation and inference techniques, interacting with
other specialists and learning from them. Polyscheme has been used to model infant reasoning
including object identity, events, causality, and spatial relations. The integration of
4.4 Hybrid Cognitive Architectures 75
reasoning methods is powerful, but the overall cognitive architecture is simplistic compared
to other systems and seems focused more on problem-solving than on the broader problem
of intelligent agent control.
• Shruti [SA93] is a fascinating biologically-inspired model of human reflexive inference,
which represents in connectionist architecture relations, types, entities and causal rules
using focal-clusters. However, much like Hofstadter’s earlier Copycat architecture [Hof95],
Shruti seems more interesting as a prototype exploration of ideas than as a practical AGI
system; at least, after a significant time of development it has not proved significantly
effective in any applications
• James Albus’s 4D/RCS robotics architecture shares a great deal with some of the emergentist
architectures discussed above, e.g. it has the same hierarchical pattern recognition
structure as DeSTIN and HTM, and the same three cross-connected hierarchies as DeSTIN,
and shares with the developmental robotics architectures a focus on real-time adaptation to
the structure of the world. However, 4D/RCS is not foundationally learning-based but relies
on hard-wired architecture and algorithms, intended to mimic the qualitative structure of
relevant parts of the brain (and intended to be augmented by learning, which differentiates
it from emergentist approaches.
As our own CogPrime approach is a hybrid architecture, it will come as no surprise that
we believe several of the existing hybrid architectures are fundamentally going in the right
direction. However, nearly all the existing hybrid architectures have severe shortcomings which
we feel will prevent them from achieving robust humanlike AGI.
Many of the hybrid architectures are in essence “multiple, disparate algorithms carrying out
separate functions, encapsulated in black boxes and communicating results with each other.”
For instance, PolyScheme, ACT-R and CLARION all display this “modularity” property to a
significant extent. These architectures lack the rich, real-time interaction between the internal
dynamics of various memory and learning processes that we believe is critical to achieving
humanlike general intelligence using realistic computational resources. On the other hand, those
architectures that feature richer integration – such as DUAL, Shruti, LIDA and MicroPsi – have
the flaw of relying (at least in their current versions) on overly simplistic learning algorithms,
which drastically limits their scalability.
It does seem plausible to us that some of these hybrid architectures could be dramatically
extended or modified so as to produce humanlike general intelligence. For instance, one could
replace LIDA’s learning algorithms with others that interrelate with each other in a nuanced
synergetic way; or one could replace MicroPsi’s simple learning and reasoning methods with
much more powerful and scalable ones acting on the same data structures. However, making
these changes would dramatically alter the cognitive architectures in question on multiple levels.
4.4.1 Neural versus Symbolic; Global versus Local
The “symbolic versus emergentist” dichotomy that we have used to structure our review of cognitive
architectures is not absolute nor fully precisely defined; it is more of a heuristic distinction.
In this section, before plunging into the details of particular hybrid cognitive architectures, we
review two other related dichotomies that are useful for understanding hybrid systems: neural
versus symbolic systems, and globalist versus localist knowledge representation.
76 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
4.4.1.1 Neural-Symbolic Integration
The distinction between neural and symbolic systems has gotten fuzzier and fuzzier in recent
years, with developments such as
• Logic-based systems being used to control embodied agents (hence using logical terms to
deal with data that is apparently perception or actuation-oriented in nature, rather than
being symbolic in the semiotic sense), see [SS03a] and [GMIH08].
• Hybrid systems combining neural net and logical parts, or using logical or neural net components
interchangeably in the same role [LAon].
• Neural net systems being used for strongly symbolic tasks such as automated grammar
learning ([Elm91], [Elm91], plus more recent work.)
Figure 4.7 presents a schematic diagram of a generic neural-symbolic system, generalizing
from [BH05], a paper that gives an elegant categorization of neural-symbolic AI systems. Figure
4.8 depicts several broad categories of neural-symbolic architecture.
Fig. 4.7: Generic neural-symbolic architecture
Bader and Hitzler categorize neural-symbolic systems according to three orthogonal axes:
interrelation, language and usage. “Language” refers to the type of language used in the symbolic
component, which may be logical, automata-based, formal grammar-based, etc. “Usage” refers
to the purpose to which the neural-symbolic interrelation is put. We tend to use “learning” as
an encompassing term for all forms of ongoing knowledge-creation, whereas Bader and Hitzler
distinguish learning from reasoning.
Of Bader and Hitzler’s three axes the one that interests us most here is “interrelation”, which
refers to the way the neural and symbolic components of the architecture intersect with each
other. They distinguish “hybrid” architectures which contain separate but equal, interacting
neural and symbolic components; versus “integrative” architectures in which the symbolic component
essentially rides piggyback on the neural component, extracting information from it and
helping it carry out its learning, but playing a clearly derived and secondary role. We prefer
Sun’s (2001) term “monolithic” to Bader and Hitzler’s “integrative” to describe this type of
system, as the latter term seems best preserved in its broader meaning.
4.4 Hybrid Cognitive Architectures 77
Fig. 4.8: Broad categories of neural-symbolic architecture
Within the scope of hybrid neural-symbolic systems, there is another axis which Bader and
Hitzler do not focus on, because the main interest of their review is in monolithic systems. We
call this axis "interactivity"’, and what we are referring to is the frequency of high-informationcontent,
high-influence interaction between the neural and symbolic components in the hybrid
system. In a low-interaction hybrid system, the neural and symbolic components don’t exchange
large amounts of mutually influential information all that frequently, and basically act like
independent system components that do their learning/reasoning/thinking periodically sending
each other their conclusions. In some cases, interaction may be asymmetric: one component may
frequently send a lot of influential information to the other, but not vice versa. However, our
hypothesis is that the most capable neural-symbolic systems are going to be the symmetrically
highly interactive ones.
In a symmetric high-interaction hybrid neural-symbolic system, the neural and symbolic
components exchange influential information sufficiently frequently that each one plays a major
role in the other one’s learning/reasoning/thinking processes. Thus, the learning processes of
each component must be considered as part of the overall dynamic of the hybrid system. The
two components aren’t just feeding their outputs to each other as inputs, they’re mutually
guiding each others’ internal processing.
One can make a speculative argument for the relevance of this kind of architecture to neuroscience.
It seems plausible that this kind of neural-symbolic system roughly emulates the kind
of interaction that exists between the brain’s neural subsystems implementing localist symbolic
processing, and the brain’s neural subsystems implementing globalist, classically “connectionist”
processing. It seems most likely that, in the brain, symbolic functionality emerges from
an underlying layer of neural dynamics. However, it is also reasonable to conjecture that this
symbolic functionality is confined to a functionally distinct subsystem of the brain, which then
78 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
interacts with other subsystems in the brain much in the manner that the symbolic and neural
components of a symmetric high-interaction neural-symbolic system interact.
Neuroscience speculations aside, however, our key conjecture regarding neural-symbolic integration
is that this sort of neural-symbolic system presents a promising direction for artificial
general intelligence research. In Chapter 26 of Volume 2 we will give a more concrete idea of
what a symmetric high-interaction hybrid neural-symbolic architecture might look like, exploring
the potential for this sort of hybridization between the OpenCogPrime AGI architecture
(which is heavily symbolic in nature) and hierarchical attractor neural net based architectures
such as DeSTIN.
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations
Another interesting distinction, related to but different from “symbolic versus emergentist”
and “neural versus symbolic”, may be drawn between cognitive systems (or subsystems) where
memory is essentially global, and those where memory is essentially local. In this section
we will pursue this distinction in various guises, along with the less familiar notion of glocal
memory.
This globalist/localist distinction is most easily conceptualized by reference to memories
corresponding to categories of entities or events in an external environment. In an AI system
that has an internal notion of “activation” – i.e. in which some of its internal elements are more
active than others, at any given point in time – one can define the internal image of an external
event or entity as the fuzzy set of internal elements that tend to be active when that event or
entity is presented to the system’s sensors. If one has a particular set S of external entities or
events of interest, then, the degree of memory localization of such an AI system relative to S
may be conceived as the percentage of the system’s internal elements that have a high degree
of membership in the internal image of an average element of S.
Of course, this characterization of localization has its limitations, such as the possibility of
ambiguity regarding what are the “system elements” of a given AI system; and the exclusive
focus on internal images of external phenomena rather than representation of internal abstract
concepts. However, our goal here is not to formulate an ultimate, rigorous and thorough ontology
of memory systems, but only to pose a “rough and ready” categorization so as to properly frame
our discussion of some specific AGI issues relevant to CogPrime. Clearly the ideas pursued here
will benefit from further theoretical exploration and elaboration.
In this sense, a Hopfield neural net [Ami89] would be considered “globalist” since it has a low
degree of memory localization (most internal images heavily involve a large number of system
elements); whereas Cyc would be considered “localist” as it has a very high degree of memory
localization (most internal images are heavily focused on a small set of system elements).
However, although Hopfield nets and Cyc form handy examples, the “globalist vs. localist”
distinction as described above is not identical to the “neural vs. symbolic” distinction. For it is
in principle quite possible to create localist systems using formal neurons, and also to create
globalist systems using formal logic. And “globalist-localist” is not quite identical to “symbolic vs
emergentist” either, because the latter is about coordinated system dynamics and behavior not
just about knowledge representation. CogPrime combines both symbolic and (loosely) neural
representations, and also combines globalist and localist representations in a way that we will
call “glocal” and analyze more deeply in Chapter 13; but there are many other ways these various
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 79
properties could be manifested by AI systems. Rigorously studying the corpus of existing (or
hypothetical!) cognitive architectures using these ideas would be a large task, which we do not
undertake here.
In the next sections we review several hybrid architectures in more detail, focusing most
deeply on LIDA and MicroPsi which have been directly inspirational for CogPrime.
4.5.1 CLARION
Ron Sun’s CLARION architecture (see Figure 4.9) is interesting in its combination of symbolic
and neural aspects – a combination that is used in a sophisticated way to embody the distinction
and interaction between implicit and explicit mental processes. From a CLARION perspective,
architectures like Soar and ACT-R are severely limited in that they deal only with explicit
knowledge and associated learning processes.
CLARION consists of a number of distinct subsystems, each of which contains a dual representational
structure, including a “rules and chunks” symbolic knowledge store somewhat
similar to ACT-R, and a neural net knowledge store embodying implicit knowledge. The main
subsystems are:
• An action-centered subsystem to control actions;
• A non-action-centered subsystem to maintain general knowledge;
• A motivational subsystem to provide underlying motivations for perception, action, and
cognition;
• A meta-cognitive subsystem to monitor, direct, and modify the operations of all the other
subsystems.

80 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
4.5.2 The Society of Mind and the Emotion Machine
In his influential but controversial book The Society of Mind [Min88], Marvin Minsky described
a model of human intelligence as something that is built up from the interactions of numerous
simple agents. He spells out in great detail how various particular cognitive functions may be
achieved via agents and their interactions. He leaves no room for any central algorithms or
structures of thought, famously arguing: “What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick
is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any
single, perfect principle.”
This perspective was extended in the more recent work The Emotion Machine [Min07], where
Minsky argued that emotions are “ways to think” evolved to handle different “problem types”
that exist in the world. The brain is posited to have rule-based mechanisms (selectors) that
turns on emotions to deal with various problems.
Overall, both of these works serve better as works of speculative cognitive science than as
works of AI or cognitive architecture per se. As neurologist Richard Restak said in his review
of Emotion Machine, “Minsky does a marvelous job parsing other complicated mental activities
into simpler elements. ... But he is less effective in relating these emotional functions to what’s
going on in the brain.” As Restak added, he is also not so effective at relating these emotional
functions to straightforwardly implementable algorithms or data structures.
Push Singh, in his PhD thesis and followup work [SBC05], did the best job so far of creating
a concrete AI design based on Minsky’s ideas. While Singh’s system was certainly interesting,
it was also noteworthy for its lack of any learning mechanisms, and its exclusive focus on
explicit rather than implicit knowledge. Due to Singh’s tragic death, his work was never brought
anywhere near completion. It seems fair to say that there has not yet been a serious cognitive
architecture posed based closely on Minsky’s ideas.
4.5.3 DUAL
The closest thing to a Minsky-ish cognitive architecture is probably DUAL, which takes the
Society of Mind concept and adds to it a number of other interesting ideas. DUAL integrates
symbolic and connectionist approaches at a deeper level than CLARION, and has been used
to model various cognitive functions such as perception, analogy and judgment. Computations
in DUAL emerge from the self-organized interaction of many micro-agents, each of which is
a hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. Each DUAL agent plays the role of a neural network
node, with an activation level and activation spreading dynamics; but also plays the role of
a symbol, manipulated using formal rules. The agents exchange messages and activation via
links that can be learned and modified, and they form coalitions which collectively represent
concepts, episodes, and facts.
The structure of the model is sketchily depicted in Figure 4.10, which covers the application
of DUAL to a toy environment called TextWorld. The visual input corresponding to a stimulus
is presented on a two-dimensional visual array representing the front end of the system.
Perceptual primitives like blobs and terminations are immediately generated by cheap parallel
computations. Attention is controlled at each time by an object which allocates it selectively
to some area of the stimulus. A detailed symbolic representation is constructed for this area
which tends to fade away as attention is withdrawn from it and allocated to another one. Cate-
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 81
gorization of visual memory contents takes place by retrieving object and scene categories from
DUAL’s semantic memory and mapping them onto current visual memory representations.
Fig. 4.10: The three main components of the DUAL model: the retinotopic visual array (RVA),
the visual working memory (VWM) and DUAL’s semantic memory. Attention is allocated to
an area of the visual array by the object in VWM controlling attention, while scene and object
categories corresponding to the contents of VWM are retrieved from the semantic memory.
In principle the DUAL framework seems quite powerful; using the language of CogPrime,
however, it seems to us that the learning mechanisms of DUAL have not been formulated in
such a way as to give rise to powerful, scalable cognitive synergy. It would likely be possible
to create very powerful AGI systems within DUAL, and perhaps some very CogPrime -like
systems as well. But the systems that have been created or designed for use within DUAL so
far seem not to be that powerful in their potential or scope.
4.5.4 4D/RCS
In a rather different direction, James Albus, while at the National Bureau of Standards, developed
a very thorough and impressive architecture for intelligent robotics called 4D/RCS,
which was implemented in a number of machines including unmanned automated vehicles. This
architecture lacks critical aspects of intelligence such as learning and creativity, but combines
perception, action, planning and world-modeling in a highly effective and tightly-integrated
fashion.
The architecture has three hierarchies of memory/processing units: one for perception, one
for action and one for modeling and guidance. Each unit has a certain spatiotemporal scope,
82 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
and (except for the lowest level) supervenes over children whose spatiotemporal scope is a subset
of its own. The action hierarchy takes care of decomposing tasks into subtasks; whereas the
sensation hierarchy takes care of grouping signals into entities and events. The modeling/guidance
hierarchy mediates interactions between perception and action based on its understanding
of the world and the system’s goals.
In his book [AM01] Albus describes methods for extending 4D/RCS into a complete cognitive
architecture, but these extensions have not been elaborated in full detail nor implemented.
Fig. 4.11: Albus’s 4D-RCS architecture for a single vehicle
4.5.5 PolyScheme
Nick Cassimatis’s PolyScheme architecture [Cas07] shares with GLAIR the use of multiple
logical reasoning methods on a common knowledge store. While its underlying ideas are quite
general, currently PolyScheme is being developed in the context of the “object tracking” domain
(construed very broadly). As a logic framework PolyScheme is fairly conventional (unlike GLAIR
or NARS with their novel underlying formalisms), but PolyScheme has some unique conceptual
aspects, for instance its connection with Cassimatis’s theory of mind, which holds that the same
core set of logical concepts and relationships underlies both language and physical reasoning
[Cas04]. This ties in with the use of a common knowledge store for multiple cognitive processes;
for instance it suggests that
• the same core relationships can be used for physical reasoning and parsing, but that each
of these domains may involve some additional relationships.
• language processing may be done via physical-reasoning-based cognitive processes, plus the
additional activity of some language-specific processes
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 83
Fig. 4.12: Albus’s perceptual, motor and modeling hierarchies
4.5.6 Joshua Blue
Sam Adams and his colleagues at IBM have created a cognitive architecture called Joshua Blue
[AABL02], which has some significant similarities to CogPrime. Similar to our current research
direction with CogPrime, Joshua Blue was created with loose emulation of child cognitive
development in mind; and, also similar to CogPrime, it features a number of cognitive processes
acting on a common neural-symbolic knowledge store. The specific cognitive processes involved
in Joshua Blue and CogPrime are not particularly similar, however. At time of writing (2012)
84 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
Joshua Blue is not under active development and has not been for some time; however, the
project may be reanimated in future.
Joshua Blue’s core knowledge representation is a semantic network of nodes connected by
links along which activation spreads. Although many of the nodes have specific semantic referents,
as in a classical semantic net, the spread of activation through the network is designed to
lead to the emergence of “assemblies” (which could also be thought of as dynamical attractors)
in a manner more similar to an attractor neural network.
A major difference from typical semantic or neural network models is the central role that
affect plays in the system’s dynamics. The weights of the links in the knowledge base are adjusted
dynamically based on the emotional context – a very direct way of ensuring that cognitive
processes and mental representations are continuously influenced by affect. Qualitatively, this
mimics the way that particular emotions in the human brain correlate with the dissemination
throughout the brain of particular neurotransmitters, which then affect synaptic activity.
A result of this architecture is that in Joshua Blue, emotion directs attention in a very direct
way: affective weighting is important in determining which associated objects will become part of
the focus of attention, or will be retained from memory. A notable similarity between CogPrime
and Joshua Blue is that in both systems, nodes are assigned two quantitative attention values,
one governing allocation of current system resources (mainly processor time; this is CogPrime’s
ShortTermImportance) and one governing the long-term allocation of memory (CogPrime’s
LongTermImportance).
The concrete work done with Joshua Blue involved using it to control a simple agent in a simulated
world, with the goal that via human interaction, the agent would develop a complex and
humanlike emotional and motivational structure from its simple in-built emotions and drives,
and would then develop complex cognitive capabilities as part of this development process.
4.5.7 LIDA
The LIDA architecture developed by Stan Franklin and his colleagues [BF09] is based on the
concept of the “cognitive cycle” - a notion that is important to nearly every BICA (Biologically
Inspired Cognitive Architectures) and also to the brain, but that plays a particularly central
role in LIDA. As Franklin says, "as a matter of principle, every autonomous agent, be it human,
animal, or artificial, must frequently sample (sense) its environment, process (make sense of)
this input, and select an appropriate response (action). The agent’s “life” can be viewed as
consisting of a continual sequence of iterations of these cognitive cycles. Such cycles constitute
the indivisible elements of attention, the least sensing and acting to which we can attend. A
cognitive cycle can be thought of as a moment of cognition, a cognitive "moment"."
4.5.8 The Global Workspace
LIDA is heavily based on the “global workspace” concept developed by Bernard Baars. As this
concept is also directly relevant to CogPrime it is worth briefly describing here.
In essence Baars’ Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a particular hypothesis about how
working memory works and the role it plays in the mind. Baars conceives working memory as the
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 85
“inner domain in which we can rehearse telephone numbers to ourselves or, more interestingly,
in which we carry on the narrative of our lives. It is usually thought to include inner speech
and visual imagery.” Baars uses the term “consciousness” to refer to the contents of working
memory – a theoretical commitment that is not part of the CogPrime design. In this section
we will use the term “consciousness” in Baars’ way, but not throughout the rest of the book.
Baars conceives working memory and consciousness in terms of a “theater metaphor” – according
to which, in the “theater of consciousness” a “spotlight of selective attention” shines
a bright spot on stage. The bright spot reveals the global workspace – the contents of consciousness,
which may be metaphorically considered as a group of actors moving in and out of
consciousness, making speeches or interacting with each other. The unconscious is represented
by the audience watching the play ... and there is also a role for the director (the mind’s executive
processes) behind the scenes, along with a variety of helpers like stage hands, script
writers, scene designers, etc.
GWT describes a fleeting memory with a duration of a few seconds. This is much shorter
than the 10-30 seconds of classical working memory – according to GWT there is a very brief
“cognitive cycle” in which the global workspace is refreshed, and the time period an item remains
in working memory generally spans a large number of these elementary “refresh” actions. GWT
contents are proposed to correspond to what we are conscious of, and are said to be broadcast
to a multitude of unconscious cognitive brain processes. Unconscious processes, operating in
parallel, can form coalitions which can act as input processes to the global workspace. Each
unconscious process is viewed as relating to certain goals, and seeking to get involved with
coalitions that will get enough importance to become part of the global workspace – because
once they’re in the global workspace they’ll be allowed to broadcast out across the mind as a
whole, which include broadcasting to the internal and external actuators that allow the mind
to do things. Getting into the global workspace is a process’s best shot at achieving its goals.
Obviously, the theater metaphor used to describe the GWT is evocative but limited; for
instance, the unconscious in the mind does a lot more than the audience in a theater. The
unconscious comes up with complex creative ideas sometimes, which feed into consciousness –
almost as if the audience is also the scriptwriter. Baars’ theory, with its understanding of unconscious
dynamics in terms of coalition-building, fails to describe the subtle dynamics occurring
within the various forms of long-term memory, which result in subtle nonlinear interactions
between long term memory and working memory. But nevertheless, GWT successfully models
a number of characteristics of consciousness, including its role in handling novel situations, its
limited capacity, its sequential nature, and its ability to trigger a vast range of unconscious
brain processes. It is the framework on which LIDA’s theory of the cognitive cycle is built.
4.5.9 The LIDA Cognitive Cycle
The simplest cognitive cycle is that of an animal, which senses the world, compares sensation to
memory, and chooses an action, all in one fluid subjective moment. But the same cognitive cycle
structure/process applies to higher-level cognitive processes as well. The LIDA architecture is
based on the LIDA model of the cognitive cycle, which posits a particular structure underlying
the cognitive cycle that possess the generality to encompass both simple and complex cognitive
moments.
86 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
The LIDA cognitive cycle itself is a theoretical construct that can be implemented in many
ways, and indeed other BICAs like CogPrime and Psi also manifest the LIDA cognitive cycle
in their dynamics, though utilizing different particular structures to do so.
Figure 4.13 shows the cycle pictorially, starting in the upper left corner and proceeding
clockwise. At the start of a cycle, the LIDA agent perceives its current situation and allocates
attention differentially to various parts of it. It then broadcasts information about the most
important parts (which constitute the agent’s consciousness), and this information gets features
extracted from it, when then get passed along to episodic and semantic memory, that interact
in the “global workspace” to create a model for the agent’s current situation. This model then,
in interaction with procedural memory, enables the agent to choose an appropriate action and
execute it - the critical “action-selection” phase!
Fig. 4.13: The LIDA Cognitive Cycle
The LIDA Cognitive Cycle in More Depth
2
We now run through the cognitive cycle in more detail. It begins with sensory stimuli from
the agent’s external internal environment. Low-level feature detectors in sensory memory begin
the process of making sense of the incoming stimuli. These low-level features are passed to
perceptual memory where higher-level features, objects, categories, relations, actions, situations,
2 This section paraphrases heavily from [Fra06]
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 87
etc. are recognized. These recognized entities, called percepts, are passed to the workspace,
where a model of the agent’s current situation is assembled.
Workspace structures serve as cues to the two forms of episodic memory, yielding both short
and long term remembered local associations. In addition to the current percept, the workspace
contains recent percepts that haven’t yet decayed away, and the agent’s model of the thencurrent
situation previously assembled from them. The model of the agent’s current situation is
updated from the previous model using the remaining percepts and associations. This updating
process will typically require looking back to perceptual memory and even to sensory memory,
to enable the understanding of relations and situations. This assembled new model constitutes
the agent’s understanding of its current situation within its world. Via constructing the model,
the agent has made sense of the incoming stimuli.
Now attention allocation comes into play, because a real agent lacks the computational resources
to work with all parts of its world-model with maximal mental focus. Portions of the
model compete for attention. These competing portions take the form of (potentially overlapping)
coalitions of structures comprising parts the model. Once one such coalition wins the
competition, the agent has decided what to focus its attention on.
And now comes the purpose of all this processing: to help the agent to decide what to do
next. The winning coalition passes to the global workspace, the namesake of Global Workspace
Theory, from which it is broadcast globally. Though the contents of this conscious broadcast
are available globally, the primary recipient is procedural memory, which stores templates of
possible actions including their context and possible results.
Procedural memory also stores an activation value for each such template – a value that
attempts to measure the likelihood of an action taken within its context producing the expected
result. It’s worth noting that LIDA makes a rather specific assumption here. LIDA’s
“activation” values are like the probabilistic truth values of the implications in CogPrime’s
Context ∧ Procedure → Goal triples. However, in CogPrime this probability is not the same as
the ShortTermImportance “attention value” associated with the Implication link representing
that implication. Here LIDA merges together two concepts that in CogPrime are separate.
Templates whose contexts intersect sufficiently with the contents of the conscious broadcast
instantiate copies of themselves with their variables specified to the current situation. These
instantiations are passed to the action selection mechanism, which chooses a single action from
these instantiations and those remaining from previous cycles. The chosen action then goes to
sensorimotor memory, where it picks up the appropriate algorithm by which it is then executed.
The action so taken affects the environment, and the cycle is complete.
The LIDA model hypothesizes that all human cognitive processing is via a continuing iteration
of such cognitive cycles. It acknowledges that other cognitive processes may also occur,
refining and building on the knowledge used in the cognitive cycle (for instance, the cognitive
cycle itself doesn’t mention abstract reasoning or creativity). But the idea is that these other
processes occur in the context of the cognitive cycle, which is the main loop driving the internal
and external activities of the organism.
4.5.9.1 Avoiding Combinatorial Explosion via Adaptive Attention Allocation
LIDA avoids combinatorial explosions in its inference processes via two methods, both of which
are also important in CogPrime :
• combining reasoning via association with reasoning via deduction
88 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
• foundational use of uncertainty in reasoning
One can create an analogy between LIDA’s workspace structures and codelets and a logicbased
architecture’s assertions and functions. However, LIDA’s codelets only operate on the
structures that are active in the workspace during any given cycle. This includes recent perceptions,
their closest matches in other types of memory, and structures recently created by other
codelets. The results with the highest estimate of success, i.e. activation, will then be selected.
Uncertainty plays a role in LIDA’s reasoning in several ways, most notably through the base
activation of its behavior codelets, which depend on the model’s estimated probability of the
codelet’s success if triggered. LIDA observes the results of its behaviors and updates the base
activation of the responsible codelets dynamically.
We note that for this kind of uncertain inference/activation interplay to scale well, some
level of cognitive synergy must be present; and based on our understanding of LIDA it is not
clear to us whether the particular inference and association algorithms used in LIDA possess
the requisite synergy.
4.5.9.2 LIDA versus CogPrime
The LIDA cognitive cycle, broadly construed, exists in CogPrime as in other cognitive architectures.
To see how, it suffices to map the key LIDA structures into corresponding CogPrime
structures, as is done in Table 4.1. Of course this table does not cover all CogPrime processes,
as LIDA does not constitute a thorough explanation of CogPrime structure and dynamics. And
in most cases the corresponding CogPrime and LIDA processes don’t work in exactly the same
way; for instance, as noted above, LIDA’s action selection relies solely on LIDA’s “activation”
values, whereas CogPrime’s action selection process is more complex, relying on aspects of
CogPrime that lack LIDA analogues.
4.5.10 Psi and MicroPsi
We have saved for last the architecture that has the most in common with CogPrime : Joscha
Bach’s MicroPsi architecture, closely based on Dietrich Dorner’s Psi theory. CogPrime has
borrowed substantially from Psi in its handling of emotion and motivation; but Psi also has
other aspects that differ considerably from CogPrime. Here we will focus more heavily on the
points of overlap, but will mention the key points of difference as well.
The overall Psi cognitive architecture, which is centered on the Psi model of the motivational
system, is roughly depicted in Figure 4.14.
Psi’s motivational system begins with Demands, which are the basic factors that motivate
the agent. For an animal these would include things like food, water, sex, novelty, socialization,
protection of one’s children, and so forth. For an intelligent robot they might include things
like electrical power, novelty, certainty, socialization, well-being of others and mental growth.
Psi also specifies two fairly abstract demands and posits them as psychologically fundamental
(see Figure 4.15):
• competence, the effectiveness of the agent at fulfilling its Urges
• certainty, the confidence of the agent’s knowledge

Table 4.1: CogPrime Analogues of Key LIDA Features
Each demand is assumed to come with a certain “target level” or “target range” (and these
may fluctuate over time, or may change as a system matures and develops). An Urge is said to
develop when a demand deviates from its target range: the urge then seeks to return the demand
to its target range. For instance, in an animal-like agent the demand related to food is more
clearly described as “fullness,” and there is a target range indicating that the agent is neither too
hungry nor too full of food. If the agent’s fullness deviates from this range, an Urge to return
the demand to its target range arises. Similarly, if an agent’s novelty deviates from its target
range, this means the agent’s life has gotten either too boring or too disconcertingly weird, and
the agent gets an Urge for either more interesting activities (in the case of below-range novelty)
or more familiar ones (in the case of above-range novelty).
There is also a primitive notion of Pleasure (and its opposite, displeasure), which is considered
as different from the complex emotion of “happiness.” Pleasure is understood as associated
with Urges: pleasure occurs when an Urge is (at least partially) satisfied, whereas displeasure
occurs when an urge gets increasingly severe. The degree to which an Urge is satisfied is not
necessarily defined instantaneously; it may be defined, for instance, as a time-decaying weighted
average of the proximity of the demand to its target range over the recent past.
So, for instance if an agent is bored and gets a lot of novel stimulation, then it experiences
some pleasure. If it’s bored and then the monotony of its stimulation gets even more extreme,
then it experiences some displeasure.
Note that, according to this relatively simplistic approach, any decrease in the amount of
dissatisfaction causes some pleasure; whereas if everything always continues within its acceptable
range, there isn’t any pleasure. This may seem a little counterintuitive, but it’s important
to understand that these simple definitions of “pleasure” and “displeasure” are not intended to
fully capture the natural language concepts associated with those words. The natural language
terms are used here simply as heuristics to convey the general character of the processes in-
90 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
Fig. 4.14: High-Level Architecture of the Psi Model
volved. These are very low level processes whose analogues in human experience are largely
below the conscious level.
A Goal is considered as a statement that the system may strive to make true at some future
time. A Motive is an (urge, goal) pair, consisting of a goal whose satisfaction is predicted to
imply the satisfaction of some urge. In fact one may consider Urges as top-level goals, and the
agent’s other goals as their subgoals.
In Psi an agent has one “ruling motive” at any point in time, but this seems an oversimplification
more applicable to simple animals than to human-like or other advanced AI systems.
In general one may think of different motives having different weights indicating the amount of
resources that will be spent on pursuing them.
Emotions in Psi are considered as complex systemic response-patterns rather than explicitly
constructed entities. An emotion is the set of mental entities activated in response to a certain
set of urges. Dorner conceived theories about how various common emotions emerge from the
dynamics of urges and motives as described in the Psi model. “Intentions” are also considered as
composite entities: an intention at a given point in time consists of the active motives, together
with their related goals, behavior programs and so forth.
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 91
The basic logic of action in Psi is carried out by “triples” that are very similar to CogPrime’s
Context ∧ Procedure → Goal triples. However, an important role is played by four modulators
that control how the processes of perception, cognition and action selection are regulated at a
given time:
• activation, which determines the degree to which the agent is focused on rapid, intensive
activity versus reflective, cognitive activity
• resolution level, which determines how accurately the system tries to perceive the world
• certainty, which determines how hard the system tries to achieve definite, certain knowledge
• selection threshold, which determines how willing the system is to change its choice of which
goals to focus on
These modulators characterize the system’s emotional and cognitive state at a very abstract
level; they are not emotions per se, but they have a large effect on the agent’s emotions. Their
intended interaction is depicted in Figure 4.15.
Fig. 4.15: Primary Interrelationships Between Psi Modulators
4.5.11 The Emergence of Emotion in the Psi Model
We now briefly review the specifics of how Psi models the emergence of emotion. The basic idea is
to define a small set of proto-emotional dimensions in terms of basic Urges and modulators.
Then, emotions are identified with regions in the space spanned by these dimensions.
The simplest approach uses a six-dimensional continuous space:
1. pleasure
92 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
2. arousal
3. resolution level
4. selection threshold (i.e. degree of dominance of the leading motive)
5. level of background checks (the rate of the securing behavior)
6. level of goal-directed behavior
Figure 4.16 shows how the latter 5 of these dimensions are derived from underlying urges and
modulators. Note that these dimensions are not orthogonal; for instance resolution is mainly inversely
related to arousal. Additional dimensions are also discussed, for instance it is postulated
that to deal with social emotions one may wish to introduce two more demands corresponding
to inner and outer obedience to social norms, and then define dimensions in terms of these.
Fig. 4.16: Five Proto-Emotional Dimensions Implicit in the Psi Model
Specific emotions are then characterized in terms of these dimensions. According to [Bac09],
for instance, “Anger ... is characterized by high arousal, low resolution, strong motive dominance,
few background checks and strong goal-orientedness; sadness by low arousal, high resolution,
strong dominance, few background-checks and low goal-orientedness.”
I’m a bit skeptical of the contention that these dimensions fully characterize the relevant
emotions. Anger for instance seems to have some particular characteristics not implied by the
above list of dimensional values. The list of dimensional values associated with anger doesn’t
tell us that an angry person is more likely to punch someone than to bounce up and down,
for example. However, it does seem that the dimensional values associated with an emotion are
4.5 Globalist versus Localist Representations 93
informative about the emotion, so that positioning an emotion on the given dimensions tells
one a lot.
4.5.12 Knowledge Representation, Action Selection and Planning in
Psi
In addition to the basic motivation/emotion architecture of Psi, which has been adopted (with
some minor changes) for use in CogPrime, Psi has a number of other aspects that are somewhat
different from their CogPrime analogues.
First of all, on the micro level, Psi represents knowledge using structures called “quads.” Each
quad is a cluster of 5 neurons containing a core neuron, and four other neurons representing
before/after and part-of/has-part relationships in regard to that core neuron. Quads are naturally
assembled into spatiotemporal hierarchies, though they are not required to form part of
such a structure.
Psi stores knowledge using quads arranged in three networks, which are conceptually similar
to the networks in Albus’s 4D/RCS and Arel’s DeSTIN architectures:
• A sensory network, which stores declarative knowledge: schemas representing images, objects,
events and situations as hierarchical structures.
• A motor network, which contains procedural knowledge by way of hierarchical behavior
programs
• A motivational network handling demands
Perception in Psi, which is centered in the sensory network, follows principles similar to
DeSTIN (which are shared also by other systems), for instance the principle of perception as
prediction. Psi’s “HyPercept” mechanism performs hypothesis-based perception: it attempts to
predict what is there to be perceived and then attempts to verify these predictions using sensation
and memory. Furthermore HyPercept is intimately coupled with actions in the external
world, according to the concept of “Neisser’s perceptual cycle,” the cycle between exploration
and representation of reality. Perceptually acquired information is translated into schemas capable
of guiding behaviors, and these are enacted (sometimes affecting the world in significant
ways) and in the process used to guide further perception. Imaginary perceptions are handled
via a “mental stage” analogous to CogPrime’s internal simulation world.
Action selection in Psi works based on what are called “triplets,” each of which consists of
• a sensor schema (pre-conditions, “condition schema”; like CogPrime’s “context”)
• a subsequent motor schema (action, effector; like CogPrime’s “procedure”)
• a final sensor schema (post-conditions, expectations; like an CogPrime predicate or goal)
What distinguishes these triplets from classic production rules as used in (say) Soar and
ACT-R is that the triplets may be partial (some of the three elements may be missing) and
may be uncertain. However, there seems no fundamental difference between these triplets and
CogPrime’s concept/procedure/goal triplets, at a high level; the difference lies in the underlying
knowledge representation used for the schemata, and the probabilistic logic used to represent
the implication.
The work of figuring out what schema to execute to achieve the chosen goal in the current
context is done in Psi using a combination of processes called the “Rasmussen ladder” (named
94 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures
after Danish psychologist Jens Rasmussen). The Rasmussen ladder describes the organization
of action as a movement between the stages of skill-based behavior, rule-based behavior and
knowledge-based behavior, as follows:
• If a given task amounts to a trained routine, an automatism or skill is activated; it can
usually be executed without conscious attention and deliberative control.
• If there is no automatism available, a course of action might be derived from rules; before a
known set of strategies can be applied, the situation has to be analyzed and the strategies
have to be adapted.
• In those cases where the known strategies are not applicable, a way of combining the
available manipulations (operators) into reaching a given goal has to be explored at first.
This stage usually requires a recomposition of behaviors, that is, a planning process.
The planning algorithm used in the Psi and MicroPsi implementations is a fairly simple
hill-climbing planner. While it’s hypothesized that a more complex planner may be needed for
advanced intelligence, part of the Psi theory is the hypothesis that most real-life planning an
organism needs to do is fairly simple, once the organism has the right perceptual representations
and goals.
4.5.13 Psi versus CogPrime
On a high level, the similarities between Psi and CogPrime are quite strong:
• interlinked declarative, procedural and intentional knowledge structures, represented using
neural-symbolic methods (though, the knowledge structures have somewhat different highlevel
structures and low-level representational mechanisms in the two systems)
• perception via prediction and perception/action integration
• action selection via triplets that resemble uncertain, potentially partial production rules
• similar motivation/emotion framework, since CogPrime incorporates a variant of Psi for
this
On the nitty-gritty level there are many differences between the systems, but on the bigpicture
level the main difference lies in the way the cognitive synergy principle is pursued in
the two different approaches. Psi and MicroPsi rely on very simple learning algorithms that are
closely tied to the “quad” neurosymbolic knowledge representation, and hence interoperate in
a fairly natural way without need for subtle methods of “synergy engineering.” CogPrime uses
much more diverse and sophisticated learning algorithms which thus require more sophisticated
methods of interoperation in order to achieve cognitive synergy.
Chapter 5
A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition
5.1 Introduction
When writing the first draft of this book, some years ago, we had the idea to explain CogPrime
by aligning its various structures and processes with the ones in the "standard architecture
diagram" of the human mind. After a bit of investigation, though, we gradually came to the
realization that no such thing existed. There was no standard flowchart or other sort of diagram
explaining the modern consensus on how human thought works. Many such diagrams
existed, but each one seemed to represent some particular focus or theory, rather than an overall
integrative understanding.
Since there are multiple opinions regarding nearly every aspect of human intelligence, it
would be difficult to get two cognitive scientists to fully agree on every aspect of an overall
human cognitive architecture diagram. Prior attempts to outline detailed mind architectures
have tended to follow highly specific theories of intelligence, and hence have attracted only
moderate interest from researchers not adhering to those theories. An example is Minsky’s work
presented in The Emotion Machine [Min07], which arguably does constitute an architecture
diagram for the human mind, but which is only loosely grounded in current empirical knowledge
and stands more as a representation of Minsky’s own intuitive understanding.
But nevertheless, it seemed to us that a reasonable attempt at an integrative, relatively
theory-neutral "human cognitive architecture diagram" would be better than nothing. So naturally,
we took it on ourselves to create such a diagram. This chapter is the result – it draws on
the thinking of a number of cognitive science and AGI researchers, integrating their perspectives
in a coherent, overall architecture diagram for human, and human-like, general intelligence. The
specific architecture diagram of CogPrime, given in Chapter 6 below, may then be understood
as a particular instantiation of this generic architecture diagram of human-like cognition.
There is no getting around the fact that, to a certain extent, the diagram presented here
reflects our particular understanding of how the mind works. However, it was intentionally
constructed with the goal of not being just an abstracted version of the CogPrime architecture
diagram! It does not reflect our own idiosyncratic understanding of human intelligence, as much
as a combination of understandings previously presented by multiple researchers (including
ourselves), arranged according to our own taste in a manner we find conceptually coherent.
With this in mind, we call it the "Integrative Human-Like Cognitive Architecture Diagram," or
for short "the integrative diagram." We have made an effort to ensure that as many pieces of
the integrative diagram as possible are well grounded in psychological and even neuroscientific
95
96 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition
data, rather than mainly embodying speculative notions; however, given the current state of
knowledge, this could not be done to a complete extent, and there is still some speculation
involved here and there.
While based on understandings of human intelligence, the integrative diagram is intended to
serve as an architectural outline for human-like general intelligence more broadly. For example,
CogPrime is explicitly not intended as a precise emulation of human intelligence, and does many
things quite differently than the human mind, yet can still fairly straightforwardly be mapped
into the integrative diagram.
The integrative diagram focuses on structure, but this should not be taken to represent a
valuation of structure over dynamics in our approach to intelligence. Following chapters treat
various dynamical phenomena in depth.
5.2 Key Ingredients of the Integrative Human-Like Cognitive
Architecture Diagram
The main ingredients we’ve used in assembling the integrative diagram are as follows:
• Our own views on the various types of memory critical for human-like cognition, and the
need for tight, "synergetic" interactions between the cognitive processes focused on these
• Aaron Sloman’s high-level architecture diagram of human intelligence [Slo01], drawn from
his CogAff architecture, which strikes me as a particularly clear embodiment of "modern
common sense" regarding the overall architecture of the human mind. We have added only
a couple items to Sloman’s high-level diagram, which we felt deserved an explicit high-level
role that he did not give them: emotion, language and reinforcement.
• The LIDA architecture diagram presented by Stan Franklin and Bernard Baars [BF09].
We think LIDA is an excellent model of working memory and what Sloman calls "reactive
processes", with well-researched grounding in the psychology and neuroscience literature.
We have adapted the LIDA diagram only very slightly for use here, changing some of
the terminology on the arrows, and indicating where parts of the LIDA diagram indicate
processes elaborated in more detail elsewhere in the integrative diagram.
• The architecture diagram of the Psi model of motivated cognition, presented by Joscha
Bach in [Bac09] based on prior work by Dietrich Dorner [Dör02]. This diagram is presented
without significant modification; however it should be noted that Bach and Dorner present
this diagram in the context of larger and richer cognitive models, the other aspects of which
are not all incorporated in the integrative diagram.
• James Albus’s three-hierarchy model of intelligence [AM01], involving coupled perception,
action and reinforcement hierarchies. Albus’s model, utilized in the creation of intelligent
unmanned automated vehicles, is a crisp embodiment of many ideas emergent from the field
of intelligent control systems.
• Deep learning networks as a model of perception (and action and reinforcement learning),
as embodied for example in the work of Itamar Arel [ARC09] and Jeff Hawkins [HB06]. The
integrative diagram adopts this as the basic model of the perception and action subsystems
of human intelligence. Language understanding and generation are also modeled according
to this paradigm.
5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence 97
One possible negative reaction to the integrative diagram might be to say that it’s a kind
of Frankenstein monster diagram, piecing together aspects of different theories in a way that
violates the theoretical notions underlying all of them! For example, the integrative diagram
takes LIDA as a model of working memory and reactive processing, but from the papers on
LIDA it’s unclear whether the creators of LIDA construe it more broadly than that. The deep
learning community tends to believe that the architecture of current deep learning networks,
in itself, is close to sufficient for human-level general intelligence – whereas the integrative
diagram appropriates the ideas from this community mainly for handling perception, action
and language, etc.
On the other hand, in a more positive perspective, one could view the integrative diagram
as consistent with LIDA, but merely providing much more detail on some of the boxes in the
LIDA diagram (e.g. dealing with perception and long-term memory). And one could view the
integrative diagram as consistent with the deep learning paradigm – via viewing it, not as
a description of components to be explicitly implemented in an AGI system, but rather as a
description of the key structures and processes that must emerge in deep learning network, based
on its engagement with the world, in order for it to achieve human-like general intelligence.
Our own view, underlying the creation of the integrative diagram, is that different communities
of cognitive science researchers have focused on different aspects of intelligence, and have
thus each created models that are more fully fleshed out in some aspects than others. But these
various models all link together fairly cleanly, which is not surprising as they are all grounded
in the same data regarding human intelligence. Many judgment calls must be made in fusing
multiple models in the way that the integrative diagram does, but we feel these can be made
without violating the spirit of the component models. In assembling the integrative diagram, we
have made these judgment calls as best we can, but we’re well aware that different judgments
would also be feasible and defensible. Revisions are likely as time goes on, not only due to
new data about human intelligence but also to evolution of understanding regarding the best
approach to model integration.
Another possible argument against the ideas presented here is that there’s nothing new – all
the ingredients presented have been given before elsewhere. To this our retort is to quote Pascal:
"Let no one say that I have said nothing new ... the arrangement of the subject is new." The
various architecture diagrams incorporated into the integrative diagram are either extremely
high level (Sloman’s diagram) or focus primarily on one aspect of intelligence, treating the
others very concisely by summarizing large networks of distinction structures and processes in
small boxes. The integrative diagram seeks to cover all aspects of human-like intelligence at a
roughly equal granularity – a different arrangement.
This kind of high-level diagramming exercise is not precise enough, nor dynamics-focused
enough, to serve as a guide for creating human-level or more advanced AGI. But it can be a
useful tool for explaining and interpreting a concrete AGI design, such as CogPrime.
5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence
The integrative diagram is presented here in a series of seven Figures.
Figure 5.1 gives a high-level breakdown into components, based on Sloman’s high-level
cognitive-architectural sketch [Slo01]. This diagram represents, roughly speaking, "modern common
sense" about how a human-like mind is architected. The separation between structures
98 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition
Fig. 5.1: High-Level Architecture of a Human-Like Mind
and processes, embodied in having separate boxes for Working Memory vs. Reactive Processes,
and for Long Term Memory vs. Deliberative Processes, could be viewed as somewhat artificial,
since in the human brain and most AGI architectures, memory and processing are closely integrated.
However, the tradition in cognitive psychology is to separate out Working Memory and
Long Term Memory from the cognitive processes acting thereupon, so we have adhered to that
convention. The other changes from Sloman’s diagram are the explicit inclusion of language,
representing the hypothesis that language processing is handled in a somewhat special way in
the human brain; and the inclusion of a reinforcement component parallel to the perception and
action hierarchies, as inspired by intelligent control systems theory (e.g. Albus as mentioned
above) and deep learning theory. Of course Sloman’s high level diagram in its original form is
intended as inclusive of language and reinforcement, but we felt it made sense to give them
more emphasis.
Figure 5.2, modeling working memory and reactive processing, is essentially the LIDA diagram
as given in prior papers by Stan Franklin, Bernard Baars and colleagues [BF09]. The
boxes in the upper left corner of the LIDA diagram pertain to sensory and motor processing,
which LIDA does not handle in detail, and which are modeled more carefully by deep learning
theory. The bottom left corner box refers to action selection, which in the integrative diagram
is modeled in more detail by Psi. The top right corner box refers to Long-Term Memory, which
the integrative diagram models in more detail as a synergetic multi-memory system (Figure
5.4).
The original LIDA diagram refers to various "codelets", a key concept in LIDA theory. We
have replaced "attention codelets" here with "attention flow", a more generic term. We suggest
one can think of an attention codelet as: a piece of information stating that, for a certain group
of items, it’s currently pertinent to pay attention to this group as a collective.
5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence 99
Fig. 5.2: Architecture of Working Memory and Reactive Processing, closely modeled on the
LIDA architecture
Figure 5.3, modeling motivation and action selection, is a lightly modified version of the
Psi diagram from Joscha Bach’s book Principles of Synthetic Intelligence [Bac09]. The main
difference from Psi is that in the integrative diagram the Psi motivated action framework is
embedded in a larger, more complex cognitive model. Psi comes with its own theory of working
and long-term memory, which is related to but different from the one given in the integrative
diagram – it views the multiple memory types distinguished in the integrative diagram as
emergent from a common memory substrate. Psi comes with its own theory of perception and
action, which seems broadly consistent with the deep learning approach incorporated in the
integrative diagram. Psi’s handling of working memory lacks the detailed, explicit workflow of
LIDA, though it seems broadly conceptually consistent with LIDA.
In Figure 5.3, the box labeled "Other portions of working memory" is labeled "Protocol and
situation memory" in the original Psi diagram. The Perception, Action Execution and Action
Selection boxes have fairly similar semantics to the similarly labeled boxes in the LIDA-like
Figure 5.2, so that these diagrams may be viewed as overlapping. The LIDA model doesn’t
explain action selection and planning in as much detail as Psi, so the Psi-like Figure 5.3 could
be viewed as an elaboration of the action-selection portion of the LIDA-like Figure 5.2. In
Psi, reinforcement is considered as part of the learning process involved in action selection and
planning; in Figure 5.3 an explicit "reinforcement box" has been added to the original Psi
diagram, to emphasize this.
Figure 5.4, modeling long-term memory and deliberative processing, is derived from our own
prior work studying the "cognitive synergy" between different cognitive processes associated
with different types of memory. The division into types of memory is fairly standard. Declarative,
procedural, episodic and sensorimotor memory are routinely distinguished; we like to distinguish
attentional memory and intentional (goal) memory as well, and view these as the interface
between long-term memory and the mind’s global control systems. One focus of our AGI design
work has been on designing learning algorithms, corresponding to these various types of memory,
100 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition
Fig. 5.3: Architecture of Motivated Action
Fig. 5.4: Architecture of Long-Term Memory and Deliberative and Metacognitive Thinking
that interact with each other in a synergetic way [Goe09c], helping each other to overcome
their intrinsic combinatorial explosions. There is significant evidence that these various types
of long-term memory are differently implemented in the brain, but the degree of structure and
dynamical commonality underlying these different implementations remains unclear.
5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence 101
Each of these long-term memory types has its analogue in working memory as well. In some
cognitive models, the working memory and long-term memory versions of a memory type and
corresponding cognitive processes, are basically the same thing. CogPrime is mostly like this
– it implements working memory as a subset of long-term memory consisting of items with
particularly high importance values. The distinctive nature of working memory is enforced via
using slightly different dynamical equations to update the importance values of items with
importance above a certain threshold. On the other hand, many cognitive models treat working
and long term memory as more distinct than this, and there is evidence for significant functional
and anatomical distinctness in the brain in some cases. So for the purpose of the integrative
diagram, it seemed best to leave working and long-term memory subcomponents as parallel but
distinguished.
Figure 5.4 also encompasses metacognition, under the hypothesis that in human beings and
human-like minds, metacognitive thinking is carried out using basically the same processes as
plain ordinary deliberative thinking, perhaps with various tweaks optimizing them for thinking
about thinking. If it turns out that humans have, say, a special kind of reasoning faculty
exclusively for metacognition, then the diagram would need to be modified. Modeling of self
and others is understood to occur via a combination of metacognition and deliberative thinking,
as well as via implicit adaptation based on reactive processing.
Fig. 5.5: Architecture for Multimodal Perception
Figure 5.5 models perception, according to the basic ideas of deep learning theory. Vision and
audition are modeled as deep learning hierarchies, with bottom-up and top-down dynamics. The
lower layers in each hierarchy refer to more localized patterns recognized in, and abstracted from,
sensory data. Output from these hierarchies to the rest of the mind is not just through the top
layers, but via some sort of sampling from various layers, with a bias toward the top layers. The
different hierarchies cross-connect, and are hence to an extent dynamically coupled together. It
is also recognized that there are some sensory modalities that aren’t strongly hierarchical, e.g
102 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition
touch and smell (the latter being better modeled as something like an asymmetric Hopfield net,
prone to frequent chaotic dynamics [LLW + 05]) – these may also cross-connect with each other
and with the more hierarchical perceptual subnetworks. Of course the suggested architecture
could include any number of sensory modalities; the diagram is restricted to four just for
simplicity.
The self-organized patterns in the upper layers of perceptual hierarchies may become quite
complex and may develop advanced cognitive capabilities like episodic memory, reasoning, language
learning, etc. A pure deep learning approach to intelligence argues that all the aspects
of intelligence emerge from this kind of dynamics (among perceptual, action and reinforcement
hierarchies). Our own view is that the heterogeneity of human brain architecture argues against
this perspective, and that deep learning systems are probably better as models of perception
and action than of general cognition. However, the integrative diagram is not committed to
our perspective on this – a deep-learning theorist could accept the integrative diagram, but
argue that all the other portions besides the perceptual, action and reinforcement hierarchies
should be viewed as descriptions of phenomena that emerge in these hierarchies due to their
interaction.
Fig. 5.6: Architecture for Action and Reinforcement
Figure 5.6 shows an action subsystem and a reinforcement subsystem, parallel to the perception
subsystem. Two action hierarchies, one for an arm and one for a leg, are shown for
5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence 103
concreteness, but of course the architecture is intended to be extended more broadly. In the
hierarchy corresponding to an arm, for example, the lowest level would contain control patterns
corresponding to individual joints, the next level up to groupings of joints (like fingers), the
next level up to larger parts of the arm (hand, elbow). The different hierarchies corresponding
to different body parts cross-link, enabling coordination among body parts; and they also connect
at multiple levels to perception hierarchies, enabling sensorimotor coordination. Finally
there is a module for motor planning, which links tightly with all the motor hierarchies, and
also overlaps with the more cognitive, inferential planning activities of the mind, in a manner
that is modeled different ways by different theorists. Albus [AM01] has elaborated this kind of
hierarchy quite elaborately.
The reward hierarchy in Figure 5.6 provides reinforcement to actions at various levels on
the hierarchy, and includes dynamics for propagating information about reinforcement up and
down the hierarchy.
Fig. 5.7: Architecture for Language Processing
Figure 5.7 deals with language, treating it as a special case of coupled perception and action.
The traditional architecture of a computational language comprehension system is a pipeline
[JM09] [Goe10d], which is equivalent to a hierarchy with the lowest-level linguistic features (e.g.
sounds, words) at the bottom, and the highest level features (semantic abstractions) at the top,
and syntactic features in the middle. Feedback connections enable semantic and cognitive modulation
of lower-level linguistic processing. Similarly, language generation is commonly modeled
hierarchically, with the top levels being the ideas needing verbalization, and the bottom level
corresponding to the actual sentence produced. In generation the primary flow is top-down,
with bottom-up flow providing modulation of abstract concepts by linguistic surface forms.
So, that’s it – an integrative architecture diagram for human-like general intelligence, split
among seven different pictures, formed by judiciously merging together architecture diagrams
produced via a number of cognitive theorists with different, overlapping foci and research
paradigms.
Is anything critical left out of the diagram? A quick perusal of the table of contents of
cognitive psychology textbooks suggests to me that if anything major is left out, it’s also
unknown to current cognitive psychology. However, one could certainly make an argument for
explicit inclusion of certain other aspects of intelligence, that in the integrative diagram are
104 5 A Generic Architecture of Human-Like Cognition
left as implicit emergent phenomena. For instance, creativity is obviously very important to
intelligence, but, there is no "creativity" box in any of these diagrams – because in our view,
and the view of the cognitive theorists whose work we’ve directly drawn on here, creativity
is best viewed as a process emergent from other processes that are explicitly included in the
diagrams.
5.4 Interpretation and Application of the Integrative Diagram
A tongue-partly-in-cheek definition of a biological pathway is "a subnetwork of a biological
network, that fits on a single journal page." Cognitive architecture diagrams have a similar
property – they are crude abstractions of complex structures and dynamics, sculpted in accordance
with the size of the printed page, and the tolerance of the human eye for absorbing
diagrams, and the tolerance of the human author for making diagrams.
However, sometimes constraints – even arbitrary ones – are useful for guiding creative efforts,
due to the fact that they force choices. Creating an architecture for human-like general
intelligence that fits in a few (okay, seven) fairly compact diagrams, requires one to make many
choices about what features and relationships are most essential. In constructing the integrative
diagram, we have sought to make these choices, not purely according to our own tastes in cognitive
theory or AGI system design, but according to a sort of blend of the taste and judgment
of a number of scientists whose views we respect, and who seem to have fairly compatible,
complementary perspectives.
What is the use of a cognitive architecture diagram like this? It can help to give newcomers
to the field a basic idea about what is known and suspected about the nature of human-like
general intelligence. Also, it could potentially be used as a tool for cross-correlating different
AGI architectures. If everyone who authored an AGI architecture would explain how their architecture
accounts for each of the structures and processes identified in the integrative diagram,
this would give a means of relating the various AGI designs to each other.
The integrative diagram could also be used to help connect AGI and cognitive psychology
to neuroscience in a more systematic way. In the case of LIDA, a fairly careful correspondence
has been drawn up between the LIDA diagram nodes and links and various neural structures
and processes [FB08]. Similar knowledge exists for the rest of the integrative diagram, though
not organized in such a systematic fashion. A systematic curation of links between the nodes
and links in the integrative diagram and current neuroscience knowledge, would constitute an
interesting first approximation of the holistic cognitive behavior of the human brain.
Finally (and harking forward to later chapters), the big omission in the integrative diagram
is dynamics. Structure alone will only get you so far, and you could build an AGI system with
reasonable-looking things in each of the integrative diagram’s boxes, interrelating according to
the given arrows, and yet still fail to make a viable AGI system. Given the limitations the
real world places on computing resources, it’s not enough to have adequate representations
and algorithms in all the boxes, communicating together properly and capable doing the right
things given sufficient resources. Rather, one needs to have all the boxes filled in properly
with structures and processes that, when they act together using feasible computing resources,
will yield appropriately intelligent behaviors via their cooperative activity. And this has to do
with the complex interactive dynamics of all the processes in all the different boxes – which is
5.4 Interpretation and Application of the Integrative Diagram 105
something the integrative diagram doesn’t touch at all. This brings us again to the network of
ideas we’ve discussed under the name of "cognitive synergy," to be discussed later on.
It might be possible to make something similar to the integrative diagram on the level of
dynamics rather than structures, complementing the structural integrative diagram given here;
but this would seem significantly more challenging, because we lack a standard set of tools for
depicting system dynamics. Most cognitive theorists and AGI architects describe their structural
ideas using boxes-and-lines diagrams of some sort, but there is no standard method for depicting
complex system dynamics. So to make a dynamical analogue to the integrative diagram, via
a similar integrative methodology, one would first need to create appropriate diagrammatic
formalizations of the dynamics of the various cognitive theories being integrated – a fascinating
but onerous task.
When we first set out to make an integrated cognitive architecture diagram, via combining
the complementary insights of various cognitive science and AGI theorists, we weren’t sure how
well it would work. But now we feel the experiment was generally a success – the resultant
integrated architecture seems sensible and coherent, and reasonably complete. It doesn’t come
close to telling you everything you need to know to understand or implement a human-like
mind – but it tells you the various processes and structures you need to deal with, and which of
their interrelations are most critical. And, perhaps just as importantly, it gives a concrete way
of understanding the insights of a specific but fairly diverse set of cognitive science and AGI
theorists as complementary rather than contradictory. In a CogPrime context, it provides a
way of tying in the specific structures and dynamics involved in CogPrime, with a more generic
portrayal of the structures and dynamics of human-like intelligence.

Chapter 6
A Brief Overview of CogPrime
6.1 Introduction
Just as there are many different approaches to human flight – airplanes, helicopters, balloons,
spacecraft, and doubtless many methods no person has thought of yet – similarly, there are likely
many different approaches to advanced artificial general intelligence. All the different approaches
to flight exploit the same core principles of aerodynamics in different ways; and similarly, the
various different approaches to AGI will exploit the same core principles of general intelligence
in different ways.
In the chapters leading up to this one, we have taken a fairly broad view of the project
of engineering AGI. We have presented a conception and formal model of intelligence, and
described environments, teaching methodologies and cognitive and developmental pathways
that we believe are collectively appropriate for the creation of AGI at the human level and
ultimately beyond, and with a roughly human-like bias to its intelligence. These ideas stand
alone and may be compatible with a variety of approaches to engineering AGI systems. However,
they also set the stage for the presentation of CogPrime, the particular AGI design on which
we are currently working.
The thorough presentation of the CogPrime design is the job of Part 2 of this book – where,
not only are the algorithms and structures involved in CogPrime reviewed in more detailed,
but their relationship to the theoretical ideas underlying CogPrime is pursued more deeply.
The job of this chapter is a smaller one: to give a high-level overview of some key aspects the
CogPrime architecture at a mostly nontechnical level, so as to enable you to approach Part
2 with a little more idea of what to expect. The remainder of Part 1, following this chapter,
will present various theoretical notions enabling the particulars, intent and consequences of the
CogPrime design to be more thoroughly understood.
6.2 High-Level Architecture of CogPrime
Figures 6.1, 6.2 , 6.4 and 6.5 depict the high-level architecture of CogPrime, which involves
the use of multiple cognitive processes associated with multiple types of memory to enable
an intelligent agent to execute the procedures that it believes have the best probability of
working toward its goals in its current context. In a robot preschool context, for example, the
107
108 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime
top-level goals will be simple things such as pleasing the teacher, learning new information
and skills, and protecting the robot’s body. Figure 6.3 shows part of the architecture via which
cognitive processes interact with each other, via commonly acting on the AtomSpace knowledge
repository.
Comparing these diagrams to the integrative human cognitive architecture diagrams given
in Chapter 5, one sees the main difference is that the CogPrime diagrams commit to specific
structures (e.g. knowledge representations) and processes, whereas the generic integrative architecture
diagram refers merely to types of structures and processes. For instance, the integrative
diagram refers generally to declarative knowledge and learning, whereas the CogPrime diagram
refers to PLN, as a specific system for reasoning and learning about declarative knowledge. Table
6.1 articulates the key connections between the components of the CogPrime diagram and
those of the integrative diagram, thus indicating the general cognitive functions instantiated by
each of the CogPrime components.
6.3 Current and Prior Applications of OpenCog
Before digging deeper into the theory, and elaborating some of the dynamics underlying the
above diagrams, we pause to briefly discuss some of the practicalities of work done with the
OpenCog system currently implementing parts of the CogPrime architecture.
OpenCog, the open-source software framework underlying the “OpenCogPrime” (currently
partial) implementation of the CogPrime architecture, has been used for commercial applications
in the area of natural language processing and data mining; for instance, see [GPPG06]
where OpenCogPrime’s PLN reasoning and RelEx language processing are combined to do
automated biological hypothesis generation based on information gathered from PubMed abstracts.
Most relevantly to the present work, it has also been used to control virtual agents in
virtual worlds [GEA08].
Prototype work done during 2007-2008 involved using an OpenCog variant called the Open-
PetBrain to control virtual dogs in a virtual world (see Figure 6.6 for a screenshot of an
OpenPetBrain-controlled virtual dog). While these OpenCog virtual dogs did not display intelligence
closely comparable to that of real dogs (or human children), they did demonstrate a
variety of interesting and relevant functionalities including:
• learning new behaviors based on imitation and reinforcement
• responding to natural language commands and questions, with appropriate actions and
natural language replies
• spontaneous exploration of their world, remembering their experiences and using them to
bias future learning and linguistic interaction
One current OpenCog initiative involves extending the virtual dog work via using OpenCog
to control virtual agents in a game world inspired by the game Minecraft. These agents are
initially specifically concerned with achieving goals in a game world via constructing structures
with blocks and carrying out simple English communications. Representative example tasks
would be:
• Learning to build steps or ladders to get desired objects that are high up
• Learning to build a shelter to protect itself from aggressors
6.3 Current and Prior Applications of OpenCog 109
Fig. 6.1: High-Level Architecture of CogPrime. This is a conceptual depiction, not a
detailed flowchart (which would be too complex for a single image). Figures 6.2 , 6.4 and 6.5
highlight specific aspects of this diagram.
• Learning to build structures resembling structures that it’s shown (even if the available
materials are a bit different)
• Learning how to build bridges to cross chasms
Of course, the AI significance of learning tasks like this all depends on what kind of feedback
the system is given, and how complex its environment is. It would be relatively simple to make
an AI system do things like this in a trivial and highly specialized way, but that is not the intent
of the project the goal is to have the system learn to carry out tasks like this using general
learning mechanisms and a general cognitive architecture, based on embodied experience and
110 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime
only scant feedback from human teachers. If successful, this will provide an outstanding platform
for ongoing AGI development, as well as a visually appealing and immediately meaningful demo
for OpenCog.
Specific, particularly simple tasks that are the focus of this project team’s current work at
time of writing include:
• Watch another character build steps to reach a high-up object
• Figure out via imitation of this that, in a different context, building steps to reach a high
up object may be a good idea
• Also figure out that, if it wants a certain high-up object but there are no materials for
building steps available, finding some other way to get elevated will be a good idea that
may help it get the object
6.3.1 Transitioning from Virtual Agents to a Physical Robot
Preliminary experiments have also been conducted using OpenCog to control a Nao robot as well
as a virtual dog [GdG08]. This involves hybridizing OpenCog with a separate (but interlinked)
subsystem handling low-level perception and action. In the experiments done so far, this has
been accomplished in an extremely simplistic way. How to do this right is a topic treated in
detail in Chapter 26 of Part 2.
We suspect that reasonable level of capability will be achievable by simply interposing DeS-
TIN (or some other system in its place) as a perception/action “black box” between OpenCog
and a robot. Some preliminary experiments in this direction have already been carried out, connecting
the OpenPetBrain to a Nao robot using simpler, less capable software than DeSTIN in
the intermediary role (off-the-shelf speech-to-text, text-to-speech and visual object recognition
software).
However, we also suspect that to achieve robustly intelligent robotics we must go beyond this
approach, and connect robot perception and actuation software with OpenCogPrime in a “white
box” manner that allows intimate dynamic feedback between perceptual, motoric, cognitive
and linguistic functions. We will achieve this via the creation and real-time utilization of links
between the nodes in CogPrime’s and DeSTIN’s internal networks (a topic to be explored in
more depth later in this chapter).
6.4 Memory Types and Associated Cognitive Processes in CogPrime
Now we return to the basic description of the CogPrime approach, turning to aspects of the
relationship between structure and dynamics. Architecture diagrams are all very well, but,
ultimately it is dynamics that makes an architecture come alive. Intelligence is all about learning,
which is by definition about change, about dynamical response to the environment and internal
self-organizing dynamics.
CogPrime relies on multiple memory types and, as discussed above, is founded on the premise
that the right course in architecting a pragmatic, roughly human-like AGI system is to handle
different types of memory differently in terms of both structure and dynamics.
6.4 Memory Types and Associated Cognitive Processes in CogPrime 111
CogPrime’s memory types are the declarative, procedural, sensory, and episodic memory
types that are widely discussed in cognitive neuroscience [TC05], plus attentional memory for
allocating system resources generically, and intentional memory for allocating system resources
in a goal-directed way. Table 6.2 overviews these memory types, giving key references and indicating
the corresponding cognitive processes, and also indicating which of the generic patternist
cognitive dynamics each cognitive process corresponds to (pattern creation, association, etc.).
Figure 6.7 illustrates the relationships between several of the key memory types in the context
of a simple situation involving an OpenCogPrime-controlled agent in a virtual world.
In terms of patternist cognitive theory, the multiple types of memory in CogPrime should be
considered as specialized ways of storing particular types of patterns, optimized for spacetime
efficiency. The cognitive processes associated with a certain type of memory deal with creating
and recognizing patterns of the type for which the memory is specialized. While in principle all
the different sorts of pattern could be handled in a unified memory and processing architecture,
the sort of specialization used in CogPrime is necessary in order to achieve acceptable efficient
general intelligence using currently available computational resources. And as we have argued
in detail in Chapter 7, efficiency is not a side-issue but rather the essence of real-world AGI
(since as Hutter has shown, if one casts efficiency aside, arbitrary levels of general intelligence
can be achieved via a trivially simple program).
The essence of the CogPrime design lies in the way the structures and processes associated
with each type of memory are designed to work together in a closely coupled way, yielding cooperative
intelligence going beyond what could be achieved by an architecture merely containing
the same structures and processes in separate “black boxes.”
The inter-cognitive-process interactions in OpenCog are designed so that
• conversion between different types of memory is possible, though sometimes computationally
costly (e.g. an item of declarative knowledge may with some effort be interpreted
procedurally or episodically, etc.)
• when a learning process concerned centrally with one type of memory encounters a situation
where it learns very slowly, it can often resolve the issue by converting some of the relevant
knowledge into a different type of memory: i.e. cognitive synergy
6.4.1 Cognitive Synergy in PLN
To put a little meat on the bones of the "cognitive synergy" idea, discussed repeatedly in prior
chapters and more extensively in latter chapters, we now elaborate a little on the role it plays
in the interaction between procedural and declarative learning.
While MOSES handles much of CogPrime’s procedural learning, and CogPrime’s internal
simulation engine handles most episodic knowledge, CogPrime’s primary tool for handling
declarative knowledge is an uncertain inference framework called Probabilistic Logic Networks
(PLN). The complexities of PLN are the topic of a lengthy technical monograph [GMIH08], and
are summarized in Chapter 34; here we will eschew most details and focus mainly on pointing
out how PLN seeks to achieve efficient inference control via integration with other cognitive
processes.
As a logic, PLN is broadly integrative: it combines certain term logic rules with more standard
predicate logic rules, and utilizes both fuzzy truth values and a variant of imprecise probabilities
called indefinite probabilities. PLN mathematics tells how these uncertain truth values propagate
112 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime
through its logic rules, so that uncertain premises give rise to conclusions with reasonably
accurately estimated uncertainty values. This careful management of uncertainty is critical for
the application of logical inference in the robotics context, where most knowledge is abstracted
from experience and is hence highly uncertain.
PLN can be used in either forward or backward chaining mode; and in the language introduced
above, it can be used for either analysis or synthesis. As an example, we will consider
backward chaining analysis, exemplified by the problem of a robot preschool-student trying to
determine whether a new playmate “Bob” is likely to be a regular visitor to is preschool or not
(evaluating the truth value of the implication Bob → regular_visitor). The basic backward
chaining process for PLN analysis looks like:
1. Given an implication L ≡ A → B whose truth value must be estimated (for instance
L ≡ Concept ∧ Procedure → Goal as discussed above), create a list (A 1 , ..., A n ) of (inference
rule, stored knowledge) pairs that might be used to produce L
2. Using analogical reasoning to prior inferences, assign each A i a probability of success
• If some of the A i are estimated to have reasonable probability of success at generating
reasonably confident estimates of L’s truth value, then invoke Step 1 with A i in place
of L (at this point the inference process becomes recursive)
• If none of the A i looks sufficiently likely to succeed, then inference has “gotten stuck”
and another cognitive process should be invoked, e.g.
– Concept creation may be used to infer new concepts related to A and B, and then
Step 1 may be revisited, in the hope of finding a new, more promising A i involving
one of the new concepts
– MOSES may be invoked with one of several special goals, e.g. the goal of finding
a procedure P so that P (X) predicts whether X → B. If MOSES finds such a
procedure P then this can be converted to declarative knowledge understandable
by PLN and Step 1 may be revisited....
– Simulations may be run in CogPrime’s internal simulation engine, so as to observe
the truth value of A → B in the simulations; and then Step 1 may be revisited....
The combinatorial explosion of inference control is combatted by the capability to defer to
other cognitive processes when the inference control procedure is unable to make a sufficiently
confident choice of which inference steps to take next. Note that just as MOSES may rely
on PLN to model its evolving populations of procedures, PLN may rely on MOSES to create
complex knowledge about the terms in its logical implications. This is just one example of the
multiple ways in which the different cognitive processes in CogPrime interact synergetically; a
more thorough treatment of these interactions is given in [Goe09a].
In the “new playmate” example, the interesting case is where the robot initially seems not
to know enough about Bob to make a solid inferential judgment (so that none of the A i seem
particularly promising). For instance, it might carry out a number of possible inferences and not
come to any reasonably confident conclusion, so that the reason none of the A i seem promising
is that all the decent-looking ones have been tried already. So it might then recourse to MOSES,
simulation or concept creation.
For instance, the PLN controller could make a list of everyone who has been a regular
visitor, and everyone who has not been, and pose MOSES the task of figuring out a procedure
for distinguishing these two categories. This procedure could then be used directly to make the
needed assessment, or else be translated into logical rules to be used within PLN inference. For
6.5 Goal-Oriented Dynamics in CogPrime 113
example, perhaps MOSES would discover that older males wearing ties tend not to become
regular visitors. If the new playmate is an older male wearing a tie, this is directly applicable.
But if the current playmate is wearing a tuxedo, then PLN may be helpful via reasoning that
even though a tuxedo is not a tie, it’s a similar form of fancy dress – so PLN may extend the
MOSES-learned rule to the present case and infer that the new playmate is not likely to be a
regular visitor.
6.5 Goal-Oriented Dynamics in CogPrime
CogPrime’s dynamics has both goal-oriented and “spontaneous” aspects; here for simplicity’s
sake we will focus on the goal-oriented ones. The basic goal-oriented dynamic of the CogPrime
system, within which the various types of memory are utilized, is driven by implications known
as “cognitive schematics”, which take the form
Context ∧ P rocedure → Goal < p >
(summarized C ∧ P → G). Semi-formally, this implication may be interpreted to mean: “If the
context C appears to hold currently, then if I enact the procedure P , I can expect to achieve the
goal G with certainty p.” Cognitive synergy means that the learning processes corresponding to
the different types of memory actively cooperate in figuring out what procedures will achieve
the system’s goals in the relevant contexts within its environment.
CogPrime’s cognitive schematic is significantly similar to production rules in classical architectures
like SOAR and ACT-R (as reviewed in Chapter 4; however, there are significant
differences which are important to CogPrime’s functionality. Unlike with classical production
rules systems, uncertainty is core to CogPrime’s knowledge representation, and each CogPrime
cognitive schematic is labeled with an uncertain truth value, which is critical to its utilization by
CogPrime’s cognitive processes. Also, in CogPrime, cognitive schematics may be incomplete,
missing one or two of the terms, which may then be filled in by various cognitive processes
(generally in an uncertain way). A stronger similarity is to MicroPsi’s triplets; the differences
in this case are more low-level and technical and have already been mentioned in Chapter 4.
Finally, the biggest difference between CogPrime’s cognitive schematics and production rules
or other similar constructs, is that in CogPrime this level of knowledge representation is not
the only important one. CLARION [SZ04], as reviewed above, is an example of a cognitive
architecture that uses production rules for explicit knowledge representation and then uses a
totally separate subsymbolic knowledge store for implicit knowledge. In CogPrime
both explicit and implicit knowledge are stored in the same graph of nodes and links, with
• explicit knowledge stored in probabilistic logic based nodes and links such as cognitive
schematics (see Figure 6.8 for a depiction of some explicit linguistic knowledge.)
• implicit knowledge stored in patterns of activity among these same nodes and links, defined
via the activity of the “importance” values (see Figure 6.9 for an illustrative example thereof)
associated with nodes and links and propagated by the ECAN attention allocation process
The meaning of a cognitive schematic in CogPrime is hence not entirely encapsulated in its
explicit logical form, but resides largely in the activity patterns that ECAN causes its activation
or exploration to give rise to. And this fact is important because the synergetic interactions
of system components are in large part modulated by ECAN activity. Without the real-time
114 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime
combination of explicit and implicit knowledge in the system’s knowledge graph, the synergetic
interaction of different cognitive processes would not work so smoothly, and the emergence of
effective high-level hierarchical, heterarchical and self structures would be less likely.
6.6 Analysis and Synthesis Processes in CogPrime
We now return to CogPrime’s fundamental cognitive dynamics, using examples from the “virtual
dog” application to motivate the discussion.
The cognitive schematic Context ∧ Procedure → Goal leads to a conceptualization of the
internal action of an intelligent system as involving two key categories of learning:
• Analysis: Estimating the probability p of a posited C ∧ P → G relationship
• Synthesis: Filling in one or two of the variables in the cognitive schematic, given assumptions
regarding the remaining variables, and directed by the goal of maximizing the
probability of the cognitive schematic
More specifically, where synthesis is concerned,
• The MOSES probabilistic evolutionary program learning algorithm is applied to find P ,
given fixed C and G. Internal simulation is also used, for the purpose of creating a simulation
embodying C and seeing which P lead to the simulated achievement of G.
– Example: A virtual dog learns a procedure P to please its owner (the goal G) in the
context C where there is a ball or stick present and the owner is saying “fetch”.
• PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for choosing C, given fixed P and
G (also incorporating sensory and episodic knowledge as appropriate). Simulation may also
be used for this purpose.
– Example: A virtual dog wants to achieve the goal G of getting food, and it knows that
the procedure P of begging has been successful at this before, so it seeks a context C
where begging can be expected to get it food. Probably this will be a context involving a
friendly person.
• PLN-based goal refinement is used to create new subgoals G to sit on the right hand side
of instances of the cognitive schematic.
– Example: Given that a virtual dog has a goal of finding food, it may learn a subgoal of
following other dogs, due to observing that other dogs are often heading toward their
food.
• Concept formation heuristics are used for choosing G and for fueling goal refinement, but
especially for choosing C (via providing new candidates for C). They are also used for
choosing P , via a process called “predicate schematization” that turns logical predicates
(declarative knowledge) into procedures.
– Example: At first a virtual dog may have a hard time predicting which other dogs are
going to be mean to it. But it may eventually observe common features among a number
of mean dogs, and thus form its own concept of “pit bull,” without anyone ever teaching
it this concept explicitly.
6.6 Analysis and Synthesis Processes in CogPrime 115
Where analysis is concerned:
• PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for estimating the probability of
the implication in the cognitive schematic, given fixed C, P and G. Episodic knowledge
is also used in this regard, via enabling estimation of the probability via simple similarity
matching against past experience. Simulation is also used: multiple simulations may be run,
and statistics may be captured therefrom.
– Example: To estimate the degree to which asking Bob for food (the procedure P is “asking
for food”, the context C is “being with Bob”) will achieve the goal G of getting food, the
virtual dog may study its memory to see what happened on previous occasions where it
or other dogs asked Bob for food or other things, and then integrate the evidence from
these occasions.
• Procedural knowledge, mapped into declarative knowledge and then acted on by PLN inference,
can be useful for estimating the probability of the implication C ∧ P → G, in cases
where the probability of C ∧ P 1 → G is known for some P 1 related to P .
– Example: knowledge of the internal similarity between the procedure of asking for food
and the procedure of asking for toys, allows the virtual dog to reason that if asking Bob
for toys has been successful, maybe asking Bob for food will be successful too.
• Inference, acting on declarative or sensory knowledge, can be useful for estimating the
probability of the implication C ∧ P → G, in cases where the probability of C 1 ∧ P → G is
known for some C 1 related to C.
– Example: if Bob and Jim have a lot of features in common, and Bob often responds
positively when asked for food, then maybe Jim will too.
• Inference can be used similarly for estimating the probability of the implication C ∧P → G,
in cases where the probability of C ∧ P → G 1 is known for some G 1 related to G. Concept
creation can be useful indirectly in calculating these probability estimates, via providing
new concepts that can be used to make useful inference trails more compact and hence
easier to construct.
– Example: The dog may reason that because Jack likes to play, and Jack and Jill are both
children, maybe Jill likes to play too. It can carry out this reasoning only if its concept
creation process has invented the concept of “child” via analysis of observed data.
In these examples we have focused on cases where two terms in the cognitive schematic are
fixed and the third must be filled in; but just as often, the situation is that only one of the
terms is fixed. For instance, if we fix G, sometimes the best approach will be to collectively
learn C and P . This requires either a procedure learning method that works interactively with a
declarative-knowledge-focused concept learning or reasoning method; or a declarative learning
method that works interactively with a procedure learning method. That is, it requires the sort
of cognitive synergy built into the CogPrime design.
116 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime
6.7 Conclusion
To thoroughly describe a comprehensive, integrative AGI architecture in a brief chapter would
be an impossible task; all we have attempted here is a brief overview, to be elaborated on in
the 800-odd pages of Part 2 of this book. We do not expect this brief summary to be enough to
convince the skeptical reader that the approach described here has a reasonable odds of success
at achieving its stated goals, or even of fulfilling the conceptual notions outlined in the preceding
chapters. However, we hope to have given the reader at least a rough idea of what sort of AGI
design we are advocating, and why and in what sense we believe it can lead to advanced artificial
general intelligence. For more details on the structure, dynamics and underlying concepts of
CogPrime, the reader is encouraged to proceed to Part 2– after completing Part 1, of course.
Please be patient – building a thinking machine is a big topic, and we have a lot to say about
it!

center is the Atomspace, the system’s central store of various forms of (long-term and working)
memory, which contains a weighted labeled hypergraph whose nodes and links are "Atoms" of
various sorts. The hexagonal boxes at the bottom denote various hierarchies devoted to recognition
and generation of patterns: perception, action and linguistic. Intervening between these
recognition/generation hierarchies and the Atomspace, we have a pattern mining/imprinting
component (that recognizes patterns in the hierarchies and passes them to the Atomspace; and
imprints patterns from the Atomspace on the hierarchies); and also OpenPsi, a special dynamical
framework for choosing actions based on motivations. Above the Atomspace we have a
host of cognitive processes, which act on the Atomspace, some continually and some only as
context dictates, carrying out various sorts of learning and reasoning (pertinent to various sorts
of memory) that help the system fulfill its goals and motivations.

are additionally represented by external data stores connected to the Atomspace, such as
the Procedure Repository; these are also shown as linked to the Atomspace.

that are often simultaneously important. The bundle of links between nodes in the
chicken map and nodes in the food map, represents an "implicit, emergent link" between the
two concept maps. This diagram also illustrates "glocal" knowledge representation, in that the
chicken and food concepts are each represented by individual nodes, but also by distributed
maps. The "chicken" ConceptNode, when important, will tend to make the rest of the map
important – and vice versa. Part of the overall chicken concept possessed by the system is expressed
by the explicit links coming out of the chicken ConceptNode, and part is represented
only by the distributed chicken map as a whole.

Toward a General Theory of General Intelligence

Chapter 7
A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
7.1 Introduction
The artificial intelligence field is full of sophisticated mathematical models and equations, but
most of these are highly specialized in nature – e.g. formalizations of particular logic systems,
analyzes of the dynamics of specific sorts of neural nets, etc. On the other hand, a number of
highly general models of intelligent systems also exist, including Hutter’s recent formalization
of universal intelligence [Hut05] and a large body of work in the disciplines of systems science
and cybernetics – but these have tended not to yield many specific lessons useful for engineering
AGI systems, serving more as conceptual models in mathematical form.
It would be fantastic to have a mathematical theory bridging these extremes – a real "general
theory of general intelligence," allowing the derivation and analysis of specific structures and
processes playing a role in practical AGI systems, from broad mathematical models of general
intelligence in various situations and under various constraints. However, the path to such a
theory is not entirely clear at present; and, as valuable as such a theory would be, we don’t
believe such a thing to be necessary for creating advanced AGI. One possibility is that the
development of such a theory will occur contemporaneously and synergetically with the advent
of practical AGI technology.
Lacking a mature, pragmatically useful "general theory of general intelligence," however, we
have still found it valuable to articulate certain theoretical ideas about the nature of general
intelligence, with a level of rigor a bit greater than the wholly informal discussions of the previous
chapters. The chapters in this section of the book articulate some ideas we have developed in
pursuit of a general theory of general intelligence; ideas that, even in their current relatively
undeveloped form, have been very helpful in guiding our concrete work on the CogPrime design.
This chapter presents a more formal version of the notion of intelligence as “achieving complex
goals in complex environments,” based on a formal model of intelligent agents. These formalizations
of agents and intelligence will be used in later chapters as a foundation for formalizing
other concepts like inference and cognitive synergy. Chapters 8 and 9 pursue the notion of cognitive
synergy a little more thoroughly than was done in previous chapters. Chapter 10 sketches
a general theory of general intelligence using tools from category theory – not bringing it to the
level where one can use it to derive specific AGI algorithms and structures; but still, presenting
ideas that will be helpful in interpreting and explaining specific aspects of the CogPrime design
in Part 2. Finally, Appendix ?? explores an additional theoretical direction, in which the mind
of an intelligent system is viewed in terms of certain curved spaces – a novel way of thinking
129
130 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
about the dynamics of general intelligence, which has been useful in guiding development of the
ECAN component of CogPrime, and we expect will have more general value in future.
Despite the intermittent use of mathematical formalism, the ideas presented in this section
are fairly speculative, and we do not propose them as constituting a well-demonstrated theory
of general intelligence. Rather, we propose them as an interesting way of thinking about general
intelligence, which appears to be consistent with available data, and which has proved inspirational
to us in conceiving concrete structures and dynamics for AGI, as manifested for example
in the CogPrime design. Understanding the way of thinking described in these chapters is valuable
for understanding why the CogPrime design is the way it is, and for relating CogPrime to
other practical and intellectual systems, and extending and improving CogPrime.
7.2 A Simple Formal Agents Model (SRAM)
We now present a formalization of the concept of “intelligent agents” – beginning with a formalization
of “agents” in general.
Drawing on [Hut05, LH07a], we consider a class of active agents which observe and explore
their environment and also take actions in it, which may affect the environment. Formally,
the agent sends information to the environment by sending symbols from some finite alphabet
called the action space Σ; and the environment sends signals to the agent with symbols from
an alphabet called the perception space, denoted P. Agents can also experience rewards, which
lie in the reward space, denoted R, which for each agent is a subset of the rational unit interval.
The agent and environment are understood to take turns sending signals back and forth,
yielding a history of actions, observations and rewards, which may be denoted
or else
a 1 o 1 r 1 a 2 o 2 r 2 ...
a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 ...
if x is introduced as a single symbol to denote both an observation and a reward. The
complete interaction history up to and including cycle t is denoted ax 1:t ; and the history before
cycle t is denoted ax <t = ax 1:t−1 .
The agent is represented as a function π which takes the current history as input, and produces
an action as output. Agents need not be deterministic, an agent may for instance induce a
probability distribution over the space of possible actions, conditioned on the current history. In
this case we may characterize the agent by a probability distribution π(a t |ax <t ). Similarly, the
environment may be characterized by a probability distribution µ(x k |ax <k a k ). Taken together,
the distributions π and µ define a probability measure over the space of interaction sequences.
Next, we extend this model in a few ways, intended to make it better reflect the realities of
intelligent computational agents. The first modification is to allow agents to maintain memories
(of finite size), via adding memory actions drawn from a set M into the history of actions,
observations and rewards. The second modification is to introduce the notion of goals.
7.2 A Simple Formal Agents Model (SRAM) 131
7.2.1 Goals
We define goals as mathematical functions (to be specified below) associated with symbols
drawn from the alphabet G; and we consider the environment as sending goal-symbols to the
agent along with regular observation-symbols. (Note however that the presentation of a goalsymbol
to an agent does not necessarily entail the explicit communication to the agent of the
contents of the goal function. This must be provided by other, correlated observations.) We also
introduce a conditional distribution γ(g, µ) that gives the weight of a goal g in the context of
a particular environment µ.
In this extended framework, an interaction sequence looks like
or else
a 1 o 1 g 1 r 1 a 2 o 2 g 2 r 2 ...
a 1 y 1 a 2 y 2 ...
where g i are symbols corresponding to goals, and y is introduced as a single symbol to denote
the combination of an observation, a reward and a goal.
Each goal function maps each finite interaction sequence I g,s,t = ay s:t with g s to g t corresponding
to g, into a value r g (I g,s,t ) ∈ [0, 1] indicating the value or “raw reward” of achieving
the goal during that interaction sequence. The total reward r t obtained by the agent is the sum
of the raw rewards obtained at time t from all goals whose symbols occur in the agent’s history
before t.
This formalism of goal-seeking agents allows us to formalize the notion of intelligence as
“achieving complex goals in complex environments” – a direction that is pursued in Section 7.3
below.
Note that this is an external perspective of system goals, which is natural from the perspective
of formally defining system intelligence in terms of system behavior, but is not necessarily very
natural in terms of system design. From the point of view of AGI design, one is generally more
concerned with the (implicit or explicit) representation of goals inside an AGI system, as in
CogPrime’s Goal Atoms to be reviewed in Chapter 22 below.
Further, it is important to also consider the case where an AGI system has no explicit goals,
and the system’s environment has no immediately identifiable goals either. But in this case, we
don’t see any clear way to define a system’s intelligence, except via approximating the system in
terms of other theoretical systems which do have explicit goals. This approximation approach
is developed in Section 7.3.5 below.
The awkwardness of linking the general formalism of intelligence theory presented here, with
the practical business of creating and designing AGI systems, may indicate a shortcoming on
the part of contemporary intelligence theory or AGI designs. On the other hand, this sort of
situation often occurs in other domains as well – e.g. the leap from quantum theory to the
analysis of real-world systems like organic molecules involves a lot of awkwardness and large
leaps a well.
132 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
7.2.2 Memory Stores
As well as goals, we introduce into the model a long-term memory and a workspace. Regarding
long-term memory we assume the agent’s memory consists of multiple memory stores corresponding
to various types of memory, e.g.: procedural (K P roc ), declarative (K Dec ), episodic
(K Ep ), attentional (K Att ) and Intentional (K Int ). In Appendix ?? a category-theoretic model
of these memory stores is introduced; but for the moment, we need only assume the existence
of
• an injective mapping Θ Ep : K Ep → H where H is the space of fuzzy sets of subhistories
(subhistories being “episodes” in this formalism)
• an injective mapping Θ P roc : K P roc × M × W → A, where M is the set of memory states,
W is the set of (observation, goal, reward) triples, and A is the set of actions (this maps
each procedure object into a function that enacts actions in the environment or memory,
based on the memory state and current world-state)
• an injective mapping Θ Dec : K Dec → L, where L is the set of expressions in some formal language
(which may for example be a logical language), which possesses words corresponding
to the observations, goals, reward values and actions in our agent formalism
• an injective mapping Θ Int : K Int → G, where G is the space of goals mentioned above
• an injective mapping Θ Att : K Int ∪ K Ep ∪ K P roc ∪ K Ec → V, where V is the space of
“attention values” (structures that gauge the importance of paying attention to an item of
knowledge over various time-scales or in various contexts)
We also assume that the vocabulary of actions contains memory-actions corresponding to the
operations of inserting the current observation, goal, reward or action into the episodic and/or
declarative memory store. And, we assume that the activity of the agent, at each time-step,
includes the enaction of one or more of the procedures in the procedural memory store. If several
procedures are enacted at once, then the end result is still formally modeled as a single action
a = a [1] ∗ ... ∗ a [k] where ∗ is an operator on action-space that composes multiple actions into a
single one.
Finally, we assume that, at each time-step, the agent may carry out an external action a i
on the environment, a memory action m i on the (long-term) memory, and an action b i on its
internal workspace. Among the actions that can be carried out on the workspace, are the
ability to insert or delete observations, goals, actions or reward-values from the workspace.
The workspace can be thought of as a sort of short-term memory or else in terms of Baars’
“global workspace” concept mentioned above. The workspace provides a medium for interaction
between the different memory types.
The workspace provides a mechanism by which declarative, episodic and procedural memory
may interact with each other. For this mechanism to work, we must assume that there are
actions corresponding to query operations that allow procedures to look into declarative and
episodic memory. The nature of these query operations will vary among different agents, but
we can assume that in general an agent has
• one or more procedures Q Dec (x) serving as declarative queries, meaning that when Q Dec is
enacted on some x that is an ordered set of items in the workspace, the result is that one
or more items from declarative memory is entered into the workspace
• one or more procedures Q Ep (x) serving as episodic queries, meaning that when Q Ep is
enacted on some x that is an ordered set of items in the workspace, the result is that one
or more items from episodic memory is entered into the workspace
7.2 A Simple Formal Agents Model (SRAM) 133
One additional aspect of CogPrime’s knowledge representation that is important to PLN is
the attachment of nonnegative weights n i corresponding to elementary observations o i . These
weights denote the amount of evidence contained in the observation. For instance, in the context
of a robotic agent, one could use these values to encode the assumption that an elementary visual
observation has more evidential value than an elementary olfactory observation.
We now have a model of an agent with long-term memory comprising procedural, declarative
and episodic aspects, an internal cognitive workspace, and the capability to use procedures to
drive actions based on items in memory and the workspace, and to move items between longterm
memory and the workspace.
7.2.2.1 Modeling CogPrime
Of course, this formal model may be realized differently in various real-world AGI systems. In
CogPrime we have
• a weighted, labeled hypergraph structure called the AtomSpace used to store declarative
knowledge (this is the representation used by PLN)
• a collection of programs in a LISP-like language called Combo, stored in a ProcedureRepository
data structure, used to store procedural knowledge
• a collection of partial “movies” of the system’s experience, played back using an internal
simulation engine, used to store episodic knowledge
• AttentionValue objects, minimally containing ShortTermImportance (STI) and LongTermImportance
(LTI) values used to store attentional knowledge
• Goal Atoms for intentional knowledge, stored in the same format as declarative knowledge
but whose dynamics involve a special form of artificial currency that is used to govern action
selection
The AtomSpace is the central repository and procedures and episodes are linked to Atoms
in the AtomSpace which serve as their symbolic representatives. The “workspace” in CogPrime
exists only virtually: each item in the AtomSpace has a “short term importance” (STI) level, and
the workspace consists of those items in the AtomSpace with highest STI, and those procedures
and episodes whose symbolic representatives in the AtomSpace have highest STI.
On the other hand, as we saw above, the LIDA architecture uses separate representations for
procedural, declarative and episodic memory, but also has an explicit workspace component,
where the most currently contextually relevant items from all different types of memory are
gathered and used together in the course of actions. However, compared to CogPrime, it lacks
comparably fine-grained methods for integrating the different types of memory.
Systematically mapping various existing cognitive architectures, or human brain structure,
into this formal agents model would be a substantial though quite plausible exercise; but we
will not undertake this here.
7.2.3 The Cognitive Schematic
Next we introduce an additional specialization into SRAM: the cognitive schematic, written
informally as
134 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
Context & P rocedure → Goal
and considered more formally as holds(C) & ex(P ) → h i where h may be an externally specified
goal g i or an internally specified goal h derived as a (possibly uncertain) subgoal of one of more
g i ; C is a piece of declarative or episodic knowledge and P is a procedure that the agent can
internally execute to generate a series of actions. ex(P ) is the proposition that P is successfully
executed. If C is episodic then holds(C) may be interpreted as the current context (i.e. some
finite slice of the agent’s history) being similar to C; if C is declarative then holds(C) may be
interpreted as the truth value of C evaluated at the current context. Note that C may refer to
some part of the world quite distant from the agent’s current sensory observations; but it may
still be formally evaluated based on the agent’s history.
In the standard CogPrime notation as introduced formally in Chapter 20 (where indentation
has function-argument syntax similar to that in Python, and relationship types are prepended
to their relata without parentheses), for the case C is declarative this would be written as
PredictiveExtensionalImplication
AND
C
Execution P
G
and in the case C is episodic one replaces C in this formula with a predicate expressing C’s
similarity to the current context. The semantics of the PredictiveExtensionalInheritance relation
will be discussed below. The Execution relation simply denotes the proposition that procedure
P has been executed.
For the class of SRAM agents who (like CogPrime) use the cognitive schematic to govern
many or all of their actions, a significant fragment of agent intelligence boils down to estimating
the truth values of PredictiveExtensionalImplication relationships. Action selection procedures
can be used, which choose procedures to enact based on which ones are judged most likely
to achieve the current external goals g i in the current context. Rather than enter into the
particularities of action selection or other cognitive architecture issues, we will restrict ourselves
to PLN inference, which in the context of the present agent model is a method for handling
PredictiveImplication in the cognitive schematic.
Consider an agent in a virtual world, such as a virtual dog, one of whose external goals is to
please its owner. Suppose its owner has asked it to find a cat, and it can translate this into a
subgoal “find cat.” If the agent operates according to the cognitive schematic, it will search for
P so that
PredictiveExtensionalImplication
AND
C
Execution P

holds.
7.3 Toward a Formal Characterization of Real-World General Intelligence 135
7.3 Toward a Formal Characterization of Real-World General
Intelligence
Having defined what we mean by an agent acting in an environment, we now turn to the
question of what it means for such an agent to be “intelligent.”
As we have reviewed extensively in Chapter 2 above, “intelligence” is a commonsense, “folk
psychology” concept, with all the imprecision and contextuality that this generally entails.
One cannot expect any compact, elegant formalism to capture all of its meanings. Even in
the psychology and AI research communities, divergent definitions abound; Legg and Hutter
[LH07a] lists and organizes 70+ definitions from the literature.
Practical study of natural intelligence in humans and other organisms, and practical design,
creation and instruction of artificial intelligences, can proceed perfectly well without an
agreed-upon formalization of the “intelligence” concept. Some researchers may conceive their
own formalisms to guide their own work, others may feel no need for any such thing.
But nevertheless, it is of interest to seek formalizations of the concept of intelligence, which
capture useful fragments of the commonsense notion of intelligence, and provide guidance for
practical research in cognitive science and AI. A number of such formalizations have been given
in recent decades, with varying degrees of mathematical rigor. Perhaps the most carefullywrought
formalization of intelligence so far is the theory of “universal intelligence” presented by
Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter in [LH07b], which draws on ideas from algorithmic information
theory.
Universal intelligence captures a certain aspect of the “intelligence” concept very well, and
has the advantage of connecting closely with ideas in learning theory, decision theory and
computation theory. However, the kind of general intelligence it captures best, is a kind which
is in a sense more general in scope than human-style general intelligence. Universal intelligence
does capture the sense in which humans are more intelligent than worms, which are more
intelligent than rocks; and the sense in which theoretical AGI systems like Hutter’s AIXI or
AIXI tl [Hut05] would be much more intelligent than humans. But it misses essential aspects
of the intelligence concept as it is used in the context of intelligent natural systems like humans
or real-world AI systems.
Our main goal in this section is to present variants of universal intelligence that better
capture the notion of intelligence as it is typically understood in the context of real-world
natural and artificial systems. The first variant we describe is pragmatic general intelligence,
which is inspired by the intuitive notion of intelligence as “the ability to achieve complex goals
in complex environments,” given in [Goe93a]. After assuming a prior distribution over the
space of possible environments, and one over the space of possible goals, one then defines the
pragmatic general intelligence as the expected level of goal-achievement of a system relative
to these distributions. Rather than measuring truly broad mathematical general intelligence,
pragmatic general intelligence measures intelligence in a way that’s specifically biased toward
certain environments and goals.
Another variant definition is then presented, the efficient pragmatic general intelligence,
which takes into account the amount of computational resources utilized by the system in
achieving its intelligence. Some argue that making efficient use of available resources is a defining
characteristic of intelligence, see e.g. [Wan06].
A critical question left open is the characterization of the prior distributions corresponding
to everyday human reality; we give a semi-formal sketch of some ideas on this in Chapter 9
below, where we present the notion of a “communication prior,” which assigns a probability
136 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
weight to a situation S based on the ease with which one agent in a society can communicate
S to another agent in that society, using multimodal communication (including verbalization,
demonstration, dramatic and pictorial depiction, etc.).
Finally, we present a formal measure of the “generality” of an intelligence, which precisiates
the informal distinction between “general AI” and “narrow AI.”
7.3.1 Biased Universal Intelligence
To define universal intelligence, Legg and Hutter consider the class of environments that are
reward-summable, meaning that the total amount of reward they return to any agent is bounded
by 1. Where r i denotes the reward experienced by the agent from the environment at time i,
the expected total reward for the agent π from the environment µ is defined as
∞∑
Vµ π ≡ E( r i ) ≤ 1
To extend their definition in the direction of greater realism, we first introduce a second-order
probability distribution ν, which is a probability distribution over the space of environments
µ. The distribution ν assigns each environment a probability. One such distribution ν is the
Solomonoff-Levin universal distribution in which one sets ν = 2 −K(µ) ; but this is not the only
distribution ν of interest. In fact a great deal of real-world general intelligence consists of the
adaptation of intelligent systems to particular distributions ν over environment-space, differing
from the universal distribution.
We then define
Definition 4 The biased universal intelligence of an agent π is its expected performance
with respect to the distribution ν over the space of all computable reward-summable environments,
E, that is,
1
Υ (π) ≡ ∑ µ∈E
ν(µ)V π µ
Legg and Hutter’s universal intelligence is obtained by setting ν equal to the universal
distribution.
This framework is more flexible than it might seem. E.g. suppose one wants to incorporate
agents that die. Then one may create a special action, say a 666 , corresponding to the state of
death, to create agents that
• in certain circumstances output action a 666
• have the property that if their previous action was a 666 , then all of their subsequent actions
must be a 666
and to define a reward structure so that actions a 666 always bring zero reward. It then follows
that death is generally a bad thing if one wants to maximize intelligence. Agents that die will
not get rewarded after they’re dead; and agents that live only 70 years, say, will be restricted
from getting rewards involving long-term patterns and will hence have specific limits on their
intelligence.
7.3 Toward a Formal Characterization of Real-World General Intelligence 137
7.3.2 Connecting Legg and Hutter’s Model of Intelligent Agents to
the Real World
A notable aspect of the Legg and Hutter formalism is the separation of the reward mechanism
from the cognitive mechanisms of the agent. While commonplace in the reinforcement learning
literature, this seems psychologically unrealistic in the context of biological intelligences and
many types of machine intelligences. Not all human intelligent activity is specifically rewardseeking
in nature; and even when it is, humans often pursue complexly constructed rewards,
that are defined in terms of their own cognitions rather than separately given. Suppose a certain
human’s goals are true love, or world peace, and the proving of interesting theorems – then these
goals are defined by the human herself, and only she knows if she’s achieved them. An externallyprovided
reward signal doesn’t capture the nature of this kind of goal-seeking behavior, which
characterizes much human goal-seeking activity (and will presumably characterize much of the
goal-seeking activity of advanced engineered intelligences also) ... let alone human behavior that
is spontaneous and unrelated to explicit goals, yet may still appear commonsensically intelligent.
One could seek to bypass this complaint about the reward mechanisms via a sort of “neo-
Freudian” argument, via
• associating the reward signal, not with the “external environment” as typically conceived,
but rather with a portion of the intelligent agent’s brain that is separate from the cognitive
component
• viewing complex goals like true love, world peace and proving interesting theorems as indirect
ways of achieving the agent’s “basic goals”, created within the agent’s memory via
subgoaling mechanisms
but it seems to us that a general formalization of intelligence should not rely on such strong
assumptions about agents’ cognitive architectures. So below, after introducing the pragmatic
and efficient pragmatic general intelligence measures, we will propose an alternate interpretation
wherein the mechanism of external rewards is viewed as a theoretical test framework for
assessing agent intelligence, rather than a hypothesis about intelligent agent architecture.
In this alternate interpretation, formal measures like the universal, pragmatic and efficient
pragmatic general intelligence are viewed as not directly applicable to real-world intelligences,
because they involve the behaviors of agents over a wide variety of goals and environments,
whereas in real life the opportunities to observe agents are more limited. However, they are
viewed as being indirectly applicable to real-world agents, in the sense that an external intelligence
can observe an agent’s real-world behavior and then infer its likely intelligence according
to these measures.
In a sense, this interpretation makes our formalized measures of intelligence the opposite of
real-world IQ tests. An IQ test is a quantified, formalized test which is designed to approximately
predict the informal, qualitative achievement of humans in real life. On the other hand,
the formal definitions of intelligence we present here are quantified, formalized tests that are
designed to capture abstract notions of intelligence, but which can be approximately evaluated
on a real-world intelligent system by observing what it does in real life.
138 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
7.3.3 Pragmatic General Intelligence
The above concept of biased universal intelligence is perfectly adequate for many purposes, but
it is also interesting to explicitly introduce the notion of a goal into the calculation. This allows
us to formally capture the notion presented in [Goe93a] of intelligence as “the ability to achieve
complex goals in complex environments.”
If the agent is acting in environment µ, and is provided with g s corresponding to g at the
start and the end of the time-interval T = {i ∈ (s, ..., t)}, then the expected goal-achievement
of the agent, relative to g, during the interval is the expectation
V π µ,g,T ≡ E(
t∑
r g (I g,s,i ))
i=s
where the expectation is taken over all interaction sequences I g,s,i drawn according to µ. We
then propose
Definition 5 The pragmatic general intelligence of an agent π, relative to the distribution
ν over environments and the distribution γ over goals, is its expected performance with respect
to goals drawn from γ in environments drawn from ν, over the time-scales natural to the goals;
that is,
∑
Π(π) ≡ ν(µ)γ(g, µ)Vµ,g,T
π
µ∈E,g∈G,T
(in those cases where this sum is convergent).
This definition formally captures the notion that “intelligence is achieving complex goals in
complex environments,” where “complexity” is gauged by the assumed measures ν and γ.
If ν is taken to be the universal distribution, and γ is defined to weight goals according to
the universal distribution, then pragmatic general intelligence reduces to universal intelligence.
Furthermore, it is clear that a universal algorithmic agent like AIXI [Hut05] would also
have a high pragmatic general intelligence, under fairly broad conditions. As the interaction
history grows longer, the pragmatic general intelligence of AIXI would approach the theoretical
maximum; as AIXI would implicitly infer the relevant distributions via experience. However,
if significant reward discounting is involved, so that near-term rewards are weighted much
higher than long-term rewards, then AIXI might compare very unfavorably in pragmatic general
intelligence, to other agents designed with prior knowledge of ν, γ and τ in mind.
The most interesting case to consider is where ν and γ are taken to embody some particular
bias in a real-world space of environments and goals, and this bias is appropriately reflected
in the internal structure of an intelligent agent. Note that an agent needs not lack universal
intelligence in order to possess pragmatic general intelligence with respect to some non-universal
distribution over goals and environments. However, in general, given limited resources, there
may be a tradeoff between universal intelligence and pragmatic intelligence. Which leads to the
next point: how to encompass resource limitations into the definition.
One might argue that the definition of Pragmatic General Intelligence is already encompassed
by Legg and Hutter’s definition because one may bias the distribution of environments within
the latter by considering different Turing machines underlying the Kolmogorov complexity.
However this is not a general equivalence because the Solomonoff-Levin measure intrinsically
7.3 Toward a Formal Characterization of Real-World General Intelligence 139
decays exponentially, whereas an assumptive distribution over environments might decay at
some other rate. This issue seems to merit further mathematical investigation.
7.3.4 Incorporating Computational Cost
Let η π,µ,g,T be a probability distribution describing the amount of computational resources consumed
by an agent π while achieving goal g over time-scale T . This is a probability distribution
because we want to account for the possibility of nondeterministic agents. So, η π,µ,g,T (Q) tells
the probability that Q units of resources are consumed. For simplicity we amalgamate space
and time resources, energetic resources, etc. into a single number Q, which is assumed to live
in some subset of the positive reals. Space resources of course have to do with the size of the
system’s memory. Then we may define
Definition 6 The efficient pragmatic general intelligence of an agent π with resource
consumption η π,µ,g,T , relative to the distribution ν over environments and the distribution γ
over goals, is its expected performance with respect to goals drawn from γ in environments drawn
from ν, over the time-scales natural to the goals, normalized by the amount of computational
effort expended to achieve each goal; that is,
Π Eff (π) ≡
∑
µ∈E,g∈G,Q,T
(in those cases where this sum is convergent).
ν(µ)γ(g, µ)η π,µ,g,T (Q)
Vµ,g,T
π Q
This is a measure that rates an agent’s intelligence higher if it uses fewer computational
resources to do its business. Roughly, it measures reward achieved per spacetime computation
unit.
Note that, by abandoning the universal prior, we have also abandoned the proof of convergence
that comes with it. In general the sums in the above definitions need not converge; and
exploration of the conditions under which they do converge is a complex matter.
7.3.5 Assessing the Intelligence of Real-World Agents
The pragmatic and efficient pragmatic general intelligence measures are more “realistic” than
the Legg and Hutter universal intelligence measure, in that they take into account the innate
biasing and computational resource restrictions that characterize real-world intelligence. But as
discussed earlier, they still live in “fantasy-land” to an extent – they gauge the intelligence of an
agent via a weighted average over a wide variety of goals and environments; and they presume
a simplistic relationship between agents and rewards that does not reflect the complexities
of real-world cognitive architectures. It is not obvious from the foregoing how to apply these
measures to real-world intelligent systems, which lack the ability to exist in such a wide variety
of environments within their often brief lifespans, and mostly go about their lives doing things
other than pursuing quantified external rewards. In this brief section we describe an approach
to bridging this gap. The treatment is left semi-formal in places.
140 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
We suggest to view the definitions of pragmatic and efficient pragmatic general intelligence
in terms of a “possible worlds” semantics – i.e. to view them as asking, counterfactually, how
an agent would perform, hypothetically, on a series of tests (the tests being goals, defined in
relation to environments and reward signals).
Real-world intelligent agents don’t normally operate in terms of explicit goals and rewards;
these are abstractions that we use to think about intelligent agents. However, this is no objection
to characterizing various sorts of intelligence in terms of counterfactuals like: how would system
S operate if it were trying to achieve this or that goal, in this or that environment, in order to
seek reward? We can characterize various sorts of intelligence in terms of how it can be inferred
an agent would perform on certain tests, even though the agent’s real life does not consist of
taking these tests.
This conceptual approach may seem a bit artificial but we don’t currently see a better
alternative, if one wishes to quantitatively gauge intelligence (which is, in a sense, an “artificial”
thing to do in the first place). Given a real-world agent X and a mandate to assess its intelligence,
the obvious alternative to looking at possible worlds in the manner of the above definitions,
is just looking directly at the properties of the things X has achieved in the real world during
its lifespan. But this isn’t an easy solution, because it doesn’t disambiguate which aspects of
X’s achievements were due to its own actions versus due to the rest of the world that X was
interacting with when it made its achievements. To distinguish the amount of achievement that
X “caused” via its own actions requires a model of causality, which is a complex can of worms in
itself; and, critically, the standard models of causality also involve counterfactuals (asking “what
would have been achieved in this situation if the agent X hadn’t been there”, etc.) [MW07].
Regardless of the particulars, it seems impossible to avoid counterfactual realities in assessing
intelligence.
The approach we suggest – given a real-world agent X with a history of actions in a particular
world, and a mandate to assess its intelligence – is to introduce an additional player, an inference
agent δ, into the picture. The agent π modeled above is then viewed as π X : the model of X that
δ constructs, in order to explore X’s inferred behaviors in various counterfactual environments.
In the test situations embodied in the definitions of pragmatic and efficient pragmatic general
intelligence, the environment gives π X rewards, based on specifically configured goals. In X’s
real life, the relation between goals, rewards and actions will generally be significantly subtler
and perhaps quite different.
We model the real world similarly to the “fantasy world” of the previous section, but with
the omission of goals and rewards. We define a naturalistic context as one in which all goals and
rewards are constant, i.e. g i = g 0 and r i = r 0 for all i. This is just a mathematical convention
for stating that there are no precisely-defined external goals and rewards for the agent. In a
naturalistic context, we then have a situation where agents create actions based on the past
history of actions and perceptions, and if there is any relevant notion of reward or goal, it
is within the cognitive mechanism of some agent. A naturalistic agent X is then an agent π
which is restricted to one particular naturalistic context, involving one particular environment
µ (formally, we may achieve this within the framework of agents described above via dictating
that X issues constant “null actions” a 0 in all environments except µ).
Next, we posit a metric space (Σ µ , d) of naturalistic agents defined on a naturalistic context
involving environment µ, and a subspace ∆ ∈ Σ µ of inference agents, which are naturalistic
agents that output predictions of other agents’ behaviors (a notion we will not fully formalize
here). If agents are represented as program trees, then d may be taken as edit distance on tree
space [Bil05]. Then, for each agent δ ∈ ∆, we may assess
7.4 Intellectual Breadth: Quantifying the Generality of an Agent’s Intelligence 141
• the prior probability θ(δ) according to some assumed distribution θ
• the effectiveness p(δ, X) of δ at predicting the actions of an agent X ∈ Σ µ
We may then define
Definition 7 The inference ability of the agent δ, relative to µ and X, is
∑
Y ∈Σ
q µ,X (δ) = θ(δ)
µ
sim(X, Y )p(δ, Y )
∑
Y ∈Σ µ
sim(X, Y )
where sim is a specified decreasing function of d(X, Y ), such as sim(X, Y ) =
1
1+d(X,Y ) .
To construct π X , we may then use the model of X created by the agent δ ∈ ∆ with the
highest inference ability relative to µ and X (using some specified ordering, in case of a tie).
Having constructed π X , we can then say that
Definition 8 The inferred pragmatic general intelligence (relative to ν and γ) of a naturalistic
agent X defined relative to an environment µ, is defined as the pragmatic general intelligence
of the model π X of X produced by the agent δ ∈ ∆ with maximal inference ability relative to µ
(and in the case of a tie, the first of these in the ordering defined over ∆). The inferred efficient
pragmatic general intelligence of X relative to µ is defined similarly.
This provides a precise characterization of the pragmatic and efficient pragmatic intelligence
of real-world systems, based on their observed behaviors. It’s a bit messy; but the real world
tends to be like that.
7.4 Intellectual Breadth: Quantifying the Generality of an Agent’s
Intelligence
We turn now to a related question: How can one quantify the degree of generality that an
intelligent agent possesses? Above we have discussed the qualitative distinction between AGI
and “Narrow AI”, and intelligence as we have formalized it above is specifically intended as
a measure of general intelligence. But quantifying intelligence is different than quantifying
generality versus narrowness.
To make the discussion simpler, we introduce the term “context” as a shorthand for “environment/interval
triple (µ, g, T ).” Given a context (µ, g, T ), and a set Σ of agents, one may
construct a fuzzy set Ag µ,g,T gathering those agents that are intelligent relative to the context;
and given a set of contexts, one may also define a fuzzy set Con π gathering those contexts with
respect to which a given agent π is intelligent. The relevant formulas are:
χ Agµ,g,T (π) = χ Conπ (µ, g, T ) = 1 N
∑
Q
η µ,g,T (Q)V π µ,g,T
Q
where N = N(µ, g, T ) is a normalization factor defined appropriately, e.g. via N(µ, g, T ) =
max
π V π µ,g,T .
One could make similar definitions leaving out the computational cost factor Q, but we
suspect that incorporating Q is a more promising direction. We then propose
142 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents
Definition 9 The intellectual breadth of an agent π, relative to the distribution ν over
environments and the distribution γ over goals, is
where H is the entropy and
H(χ P Con π
(µ, g, T ))
χ P Con π
(µ, g, T ) =
∑
(µ α,g β .T ω)
ν(µ)γ(g, µ)χ Conπ (µ, g, T )
ν(µ α )γ(g β , µ α )χ Conπ (µ α , g β , T ω )
is the probability distribution formed by normalizing the fuzzy set χ Conπ (µ, g, T ).
A similar definition of the intellectual breadth of a context (µ, g, T ), relative to the distribution
σ over agents, may be posited. A weakness of these definitions is that they don’t try to
account for dependencies between agents or contexts; perhaps more refined formulations may
be developed that account explicitly for these dependencies.
Note that the intellectual breadth of an agent as defined here is largely independent of
the (efficient or not) pragmatic general intelligence of that agent. One could have a rather
(efficiently or not) pragmatically generally intelligent system with little breadth: this would be
a system very good at solving a fair number of hard problems, yet wholly incompetent on a
larger number of hard problems. On the other hand, one could also have a terribly (efficiently or
not) pragmatically generally stupid system with great intellectual breadth: i.e a system roughly
equally dumb in all contexts!
Thus, one can characterize an intelligent agent as “narrow” with respect to distribution ν over
environments and the distribution γ over goals, based on evaluating it as having low intellectual
breadth. A “narrow AI” relative to ν and γ would then be an AI agent with a relatively high
efficient pragmatic general intelligence but a relatively low intellectual breadth.
7.5 Conclusion
Our main goal in this chapter has been to push the formal understanding of intelligence in a more
pragmatic direction. Much more work remains to be done, e.g. in specifying the environment,
goal and efficiency distributions relevant to real-world systems, but we believe that the ideas
presented here constitute nontrivial progress.
If the line of research suggested in this chapter succeeds, then eventually, one will be able to
do AGI research as follows: Specify an AGI architecture formally, and then use the mathematics
of general intelligence to derive interesting results about the environments, goals and hardware
platforms relative to which the AGI architecture will display significant pragmatic or efficient
pragmatic general intelligence, and intellectual breadth. The remaining chapters in this section
present further ideas regarding how to work toward this goal. For the time being, such a mode
of AGI research remains mainly for the future, but we have still found the formalism given in
these chapters useful for formulating and clarifying various aspects of the CogPrime design as
will be presented in later chapters.
Chapter 8
Cognitive Synergy
8.1 Cognitive Synergy
As we have seen, the formal theory of general intelligence, in its current form, doesn’t really
tell us much that’s of use for creating real-world AGI systems. It tells us that creating extraordinarily
powerful general intelligence is almost trivial if one has unrealistically huge amounts
of computational resources; and that creating moderately powerful general intelligence using
feasible computational resources is all about creating AI algorithms and data structures that
(explicitly or implicitly) match the restrictions implied by a certain class of situations, to which
the general intelligence is biased.
We’ve also described, in various previous chapters, some non-rigorous, conceptual principles
that seem to explain key aspects of feasible general intelligence: the complementary reliance on
evolution and autopoiesis, the superposition of hierarchical and heterarchical structures, and so
forth. These principles can be considered as broad strategies for achieving general intelligence
in certain broad classes of situations. Although, a lot of research needs to be done to figure out
nice ways to describe, for instance, in what class of situations evolution is an effective learning
strategy, in what class of situations dual hierarchical/heterarchical structure is an effective way
to organize memory, etc.
In this chapter we’ll dig deeper into one of the “general principle of feasible general intelligences”
briefly alluded to earlier: the cognitive synergy principle, which is both a conceptual
hypothesis about the structure of generally intelligent systems in certain classes of environments,
and a design principle used to guide the architecting of CogPrime.
We will focus here on cognitive synergy specifically in the case of “multi-memory systems,”
which we define as intelligent systems (like CogPrime) whose combination of environment,
embodiment and motivational systems make it important for them to possess memories that
divide into partially but not wholly distinct components corresponding to the categories of:
• Declarative memory
• Procedural memory (memory about how to do certain things)
• Sensory and episodic memory
• Attentional memory (knowledge about what to pay attention to in what contexts
• Intentional memory (knowledge about the system’s own goals and subgoals)
In Chapter 9 below we present a detailed argument as to how the requirement for a multimemory
underpinning for general intelligence emerges from certain underlying assumptions
143
144 8 Cognitive Synergy
regarding the measurement of the simplicity of goals and environments; but the points made
here do not rely on that argument. What they do rely on is the assumption that, in the
intelligence in question, the different components of memory are significantly but not wholly
distinct. That is, there are significant “family resemblances” between the memories of a single
type, yet there are also thoroughgoing connections between memories of different types.
The cognitive synergy principle, if correct, applies to any AI system demonstrating intelligence
in the context of embodied, social communication. However, one may also take the theory
as an explicit guide for constructing AGI systems; and of course, the bulk of this book describes
one AGI architecture, CogPrime, designed in such a way.
It is possible to cast these notions in mathematical form, and we make some efforts in this
direction in Appendix ??, using the languages of category theory and information geometry.
However, this formalization has not yet led to any rigorous proof of the generality of cognitive
synergy nor any other exciting theorems; with luck this will come as the mathematics is further
developed. In this chapter the presentation is kept on the heuristic level, which is all that is
critically needed for motivating the CogPrime design.
8.2 Cognitive Synergy
The essential idea of cognitive synergy, in the context of multi-memory systems, may be expressed
in terms of the following points:
1. Intelligence, relative to a certain set of environments, may be understood as the capability
to achieve complex goals in these environments.
2. With respect to certain classes of goals and environments (see Chapter 9 for a hypothesis
in this regard), an intelligent system requires a “multi-memory” architecture, meaning
the possession of a number of specialized yet interconnected knowledge types, including:
declarative, procedural, attentional, sensory, episodic and intentional (goal-related). These
knowledge types may be viewed as different sorts of patterns that a system recognizes in
itself and its environment. Knowledge of these various different types must be interlinked,
and in some cases may represent differing views of the same content (see Figure ??)
3. Such a system must possess knowledge creation (i.e. pattern recognition / formation) mechanisms
corresponding to each of these memory types. These mechanisms are also called
“cognitive processes.”
4. Each of these cognitive processes, to be effective, must have the capability to recognize when
it lacks the information to perform effectively on its own; and in this case, to dynamically
and interactively draw information from knowledge creation mechanisms dealing with other
types of knowledge
5. This cross-mechanism interaction must have the result of enabling the knowledge creation
mechanisms to perform much more effectively in combination than they would if operated
non-interactively. This is “cognitive synergy.”
While these points are implicit in the theory of mind given in [Goe06a], they are not articulated
in this specific form there.
Interactions as mentioned in Points 4 and 5 in the above list are the real conceptual meat
of the cognitive synergy idea. One way to express the key idea here is that most AI algorithms
suffer from combinatorial explosions: the number of possible elements to be combined in a
8.2 Cognitive Synergy 145
Fig. 8.1: Illustrative example of the interactions between multiple types of knowledge, in representing
a simple piece of knowledge. Generally speaking, one type of knowledge can be converted
to another, at the cost of some loss of information. The synergy between cognitive processes
associated with corresponding pieces of knowledge, possessing different type, is a critical aspect
of general intelligence.
synthesis or analysis is just too great, and the algorithms are unable to filter through all the
possibilities, given the lack of intrinsic constraint that comes along with a “general intelligence”
context (as opposed to a narrow-AI problem like chess-playing, where the context is constrained
and hence restricts the scope of possible combinations that needs to be considered). In an AGI
architecture based on cognitive synergy, the different learning mechanisms must be designed
specifically to interact in such a way as to palliate each others’ combinatorial explosions - so
that, for instance, each learning mechanism dealing with a certain sort of knowledge, must
synergize with learning mechanisms dealing with the other sorts of knowledge, in a way that
decreases the severity of combinatorial explosion.
One prerequisite for cognitive synergy to work is that each learning mechanism must recognize
when it is “stuck,” meaning it’s in a situation where it has inadequate information to
make a confident judgment about what steps to take next. Then, when it does recognize that
it’s stuck, it may request help from other, complementary cognitive mechanisms.
A theoretical notion closely related to cognitive synergy is the cognitive schematic, formalized
in Chapter 7 above, which states that the activity of the different cognitive processes involved
in an intelligent system may be modeled in terms of the schematic implication
Context ∧ P rocedure → Goal
146 8 Cognitive Synergy
where the Context involves sensory, episodic and/or declarative knowledge; and attentional
knowledge is used to regulate how much resource is given to each such schematic implication in
memory. Synergy among the learning processes dealing with the context, the procedure and the
goal is critical to the adequate execution of the cognitive schematic using feasible computational
resources.
Finally, drilling a little deeper into Point 3 above, one arrives at a number of possible knowledge
creation mechanisms (cognitive processes) corresponding to each of the key types of knowledge.
Figure ?? below gives a high-level overview of the main types of cognitive process considered
in the current version of Cognitive Synergy Theory, categorized according to the type
of knowledge with which each process deals.
8.3 Cognitive Synergy in CogPrime
Different cognitive systems will use different processes to fulfill the various roles identified in
Figure ?? above. Here we briefly preview the basic cognitive processes that the CogPrime AGI
design uses for these roles, and the synergies that exist between these.

is: each of these cognitive structures or processes deals with one or more types of memory –
declarative, procedural, sensory, episodic or attentional. Table 8.5 describes the key CogPrime
8.3 Cognitive Synergy in CogPrime 147
Fig. 8.2: High-level overview of the key cognitive dynamics considered here in the context of
cognitive synergy. The cognitive synergy principle describes the behavior of a system as it
pursues a set of goals (which in most cases may be assumed to be supplied to the system
“a priori”, but then refined by inference and other processes). The assumed intelligent agent
model is roughly as follows: At each time the system chooses a set of procedures to execute,
based on its judgments regarding which procedures will best help it achieve its goals in the
current context. These procedures may involve external actions (e.g. involving conversation,
or controlling an agent in a simulated world) and/or internal cognitive actions. In order to
make these judgments it must effectively manage declarative, procedural, episodic, sensory
and attentional memory, each of which is associated with specific algorithms and structures
as depicted in the diagram. There are also global processes spanning all the forms of memory,
including the allocation of attention to different memory items and cognitive processes, and the
identification and reification of system-wide activity patterns (the latter referred to as “map
formation”)

processes in terms of the “analysis vs. synthesis” distinction. Finally, Tables ?? and ?? exemplify
these structures and processes in the context of embodied virtual agent control.
In the CogPrime context, a procedure in this cognitive schematic is a program tree stored
in the system’s procedural knowledge base; and a context is a (fuzzy, probabilistic) logical
predicate stored in the AtomSpace, that holds, to a certain extent, during each interval of time.
A goal is a fuzzy logical predicate that has a certain value at each interval of time, as well.
Attentional knowledge is handled in CogPrime by the ECAN artificial economics mechanism,
that continually updates ShortTermImportance and LongTerm Importance values associated
with each item in the CogPrime system’s memory, which control the amount of attention other
cognitive mechanisms pay to the item, and how much motive the system has to keep the
item in memory. HebbianLinks are then created between knowledge items that often possess
ShortTermImportance at the same time; this is CogPrime’s version of traditional Hebbian
learning.
ECAN has deep interactions with other cognitive mechanisms as well, which are essential
to its efficient operation; for instance, PLN inference may be used to help ECAN extrapolate
conclusions about what is worth paying attention to, and MOSES may be used to recognize
subtle attentional patterns. ECAN also handles “assignment of credit”, the figuring-out of the
causes of an instance of successful goal-achievement, drawing on PLN and MOSES as needed
when the causal inference involved here becomes difficult.
The synergies between CogPrime’s cognitive processes are well summarized below, which is
a 16x16 matrix summarizing a host of interprocess interactions generic to CST.
One key aspect of how CogPrime implements cognitive synergy is PLN’s sophisticated management
of the confidence of judgments. This ties in with the way OpenCogPrime’s PLN inference
framework represents truth values in terms of multiple components (as opposed to the
single probability values used in many probabilistic inference systems and formalisms): each
item in OpenCogPrime’s declarative memory has a confidence value associated with it, which
tells how much weight the system places on its knowledge about that memory item. This assists
with cognitive synergy as follows: A learning mechanism may consider itself “stuck”, generally
speaking, when it has no high-confidence estimates about the next step it should take.
Without reasonably accurate confidence assessment to guide it, inter-component interaction
could easily lead to increased rather than decreased combinatorial explosion. And of course
there is an added recursion here, in that confidence assessment is carried out partly via PLN
inference, which in itself relies upon these same synergies for its effective operation.
To illustrate this point further, consider one of the synergetic aspects described in ?? below:
the role cognitive synergy plays in deductive inference. Deductive inference is a hard problem
in general - but what is hard about it is not carrying out inference steps, but rather “inference
control” (i.e., choosing which inference steps to carry out). Specifically, what must happen for
deduction to succeed in CogPrime is:
1. the system must recognize when its deductive inference process is “stuck”, i.e. when the
PLN inference control mechanism carrying out deduction has no clear idea regarding which
inference step(s) to take next, even after considering all the domain knowledge at is disposal
2. in this case, the system must defer to another learning mechanism to gather more information
about the different choices available - and the other learning mechanism chosen must,
a reasonable percentage of the time, actually provide useful information that helps PLN to
get “unstuck” and continue the deductive process
8.4 Some Critical Synergies 149
For instance, deduction might defer to the “attentional knowledge” subsystem, and make
a judgment as to which of the many possible next deductive steps are most associated with
the goal of inference and the inference steps taken so far, according to the HebbianLinks constructed
by the attention allocation subsystem, based on observed associations. Or, if this fails,
deduction might ask MOSES (running in supervised categorization mode) to learn predicates
characterizing some of the terms involving the possible next inference steps. Once MOSES provides
these new predicates, deduction can then attempt to incorporate these into its inference
process, hopefully (though not necessarily) arriving at a higher-confidence next step.
8.4 Some Critical Synergies
Referring back to Figure ??, and summarizing many of the ideas in the previous section, Table
?? enumerates a number of specific ways in which the cognitive processes mentioned in the
Figure may synergize with one another, potentially achieving dramatically greater efficiency
than would be possible on their own.
Of course, realizing these synergies on the practical algorithmic level requires significant
inventiveness and may be approached in many different ways. The specifics of how CogPrime
manifests these synergies are discussed in many following chapters.
Fig. 8.3: This table, and the following ones, show some of the synergies between the primary
cognitive processes explicitly used in CogPrime.
150 8 Cognitive Synergy
8.5 The Cognitive Schematic 151
8.5 The Cognitive Schematic
Now we return to the “cognitive schematic” notion, according to which various cognitive processes
involved in intelligence may be understood to work together via the implication
Context ∧ P rocedure → Goal < p >
(summarized C ∧ P → G). Semi-formally, this implication may be interpreted to mean: “If the
context C appears to hold currently, then if I enact the procedure P , I can expect to achieve
the goal G with certainty p.”
The cognitive schematic leads to a conceptualization of the internal action of an intelligent
system as involving two key categories of learning:
• Analysis: Estimating the probability p of a posited C ∧ P → G relationship
• Synthesis: Filling in one or two of the variables in the cognitive schematic, given assumptions
regarding the remaining variables, and directed by the goal of maximizing the
probability of the cognitive schematic
More specifically, where synthesis is concerned, some key examples are:
• The MOSES probabilistic evolutionary program learning algorithm is applied to find P ,
given fixed C and G. Internal simulation is also used, for the purpose of creating a simulation
embodying C and seeing which P lead to the simulated achievement of G.
– Example: A virtual dog learns a procedure P to please its owner (the goal G) in the
context C where there is a ball or stick present and the owner is saying “fetch”.
• PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for choosing C, given fixed P and
G (also incorporating sensory and episodic knowledge as appropriate). Simulation may also
be used for this purpose.
152 8 Cognitive Synergy
– Example: A virtual dog wants to achieve the goal G of getting food, and it knows that
the procedure P of begging has been successful at this before, so it seeks a context C
where begging can be expected to get it food. Probably this will be a context involving a
friendly person.
• PLN-based goal refinement is used to create new subgoals G to sit on the right hand side
of instances of the cognitive schematic.
– Example: Given that a virtual dog has a goal of finding food, it may learn a subgoal of
following other dogs, due to observing that other dogs are often heading toward their
food.
• Concept formation heuristics are used for choosing G and for fueling goal refinement, but
especially for choosing C (via providing new candidates for C). They are also used for
choosing P , via a process called “predicate schematization” that turns logical predicates
(declarative knowledge) into procedures.
– Example: At first a virtual dog may have a hard time predicting which other dogs are
going to be mean to it. But it may eventually observe common features among a number
of mean dogs, and thus form its own concept of “pit bull,” without anyone ever teaching
it this concept explicitly.
Where analysis is concerned:
• PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for estimating the probability of
the implication in the cognitive schematic, given fixed C, P and G. Episodic knowledge
is also used this regard, via enabling estimation of the probability via simple similarity
matching against past experience. Simulation is also used: multiple simulations may be
run, and statistics may be captured therefrom.
– Example: To estimate the degree to which asking Bob for food (the procedure P is “asking
for food”, the context C is “being with Bob”) will achieve the goal G of getting food, the
virtual dog may study its memory to see what happened on previous occasions where it
or other dogs asked Bob for food or other things, and then integrate the evidence from
these occasions.
• Procedural knowledge, mapped into declarative knowledge and then acted on by PLN inference,
can be useful for estimating the probability of the implication C ∧ P → G, in cases
where the probability of C ∧ P 1 → G is known for some P 1 related to P .
– Example: knowledge of the internal similarity between the procedure of asking for food
and the procedure of asking for toys, allows the virtual dog to reason that if asking Bob
for toys has been successful, maybe asking Bob for food will be successful too.
• Inference, acting on declarative or sensory knowledge, can be useful for estimating the
probability of the implication C ∧ P → G, in cases where the probability of C 1 ∧ P → G is
known for some C 1 related to C.
– Example: if Bob and Jim have a lot of features in common, and Bob often responds
positively when asked for food, then maybe Jim will too.
• Inference can be used similarly for estimating the probability of the implication C ∧P → G,
in cases where the probability of C ∧ P → G 1 is known for some G 1 related to G. Concept
8.6 Cognitive Synergy for Procedural and Declarative Learning 153
creation can be useful indirectly in calculating these probability estimates, via providing
new concepts that can be used to make useful inference trails more compact and hence
easier to construct.
– Example: The dog may reason that because Jack likes to play, and Jack and Jill are both
children, maybe Jill likes to play too. It can carry out this reasoning only if its concept
creation process has invented the concept of “child” via analysis of observed data.
In these examples we have focused on cases where two terms in the cognitive schematic are
fixed and the third must be filled in; but just as often, the situation is that only one of the
terms is fixed. For instance, if we fix G, sometimes the best approach will be to collectively
learn C and P . This requires either a procedure learning method that works interactively with a
declarative-knowledge-focused concept learning or reasoning method; or a declarative learning
method that works interactively with a procedure learning method. That is, it requires the sort
of cognitive synergy built into the CogPrime design.
8.6 Cognitive Synergy for Procedural and Declarative Learning
We now present a little more algorithmic detail regarding the operation and synergetic interaction
of CogPrime’s two most sophisticated components: the MOSES procedure learning
algorithm (see Chapter 33), and the PLN uncertain inference framework (see Chapter 34). The
treatment is necessarily quite compact, since we have not yet reviewed the details of either
MOSES or PLN; but as well as illustrating the notion of cognitive synergy more concretely,
perhaps the high-level discussion here will make clearer how MOSES and PLN fit into the big
picture of CogPrime.
8.6.1 Cognitive Synergy in MOSES
MOSES, CogPrime’s primary algorithm for learning procedural knowledge, has been tested on
a variety of application problems including standard GP test problems, virtual agent control,
biological data analysis and text classification [Loo06]. It represents procedures internally as
program trees. Each node in a MOSES program tree is supplied with a “knob,” comprising a
set of values that may potentially be chosen to replace the data item or operator at that node.
So for instance a node containing the number 7 may be supplied with a knob that can take
on any integer value. A node containing a while loop may be supplied with a knob that can
take on various possible control flow operators including conditionals or the identity. A node
containing a procedure representing a particular robot movement, may be supplied with a knob
that can take on values corresponding to multiple possible movements. Following a metaphor
suggested by Douglas Hofstadter [Hof96], MOSES learning covers both “knob twiddling” (setting
the values of knobs) and “knob creation.”
MOSES is invoked within CogPrime in a number of ways, but most commonly for finding a
procedure P satisfying a probabilistic implication C&P → G as described above, where C is an
observed context and G is a system goal. In this case the probability value of the implication
provides the “scoring function” that MOSES uses to assess the quality of candidate procedures.
154 8 Cognitive Synergy
Fig. 8.4: High-Level Control Flow of MOSES Algorithm
For example, suppose an CogPrime -controlled robot is trying to learn to play the game
of “tag." (I.e. a multi-agent game in which one agent is specially labeled "it", and runs after
the other player agents, trying to touch them. Once another agent is touched, it becomes the
new "it" and the previous "it" becomes just another player agent.) Then its context C is that
others are trying to play a game they call “tag” with it; and we may assume its goals are to
please them and itself, and that it has figured out that in order to achieve this goal it should
learn some procedure to follow when interacting with others who have said they are playing
“tag.” In this case a potential tag-playing procedure might contain nodes for physical actions
like step_f orward(speed s), as well as control flow nodes containing operators like if else
(for instance, there would probably be a conditional telling the robot to do something different
depending on whether someone seems to be chasing it). Each of these program tree nodes would
have an appropriate knob assigned to it. And the scoring function would evaluate a procedure
P in terms of how successfully the robot played tag when controlling its behaviors according to
P (noting that it may also be using other control procedures concurrently with P ). It’s worth
noting here that evaluating the scoring function in this case involves some inference already,
because in order to tell if it is playing tag successfully, in a real-world context, it must watch
and understand the behavior of the other players.
MOSES follows the high-level control flow depicted in Figure 8.4, which corresponds to the
following process for evolving a metapopulation of “demes“ of programs (each deme being a set
of relatively similar programs, forming a sort of island in program space):
1. Construct an initial set of knobs based on some prior (e.g., based on an empty program;
or more interestingly, using prior knowledge supplied by PLN inference based on the
system’s memory) and use it to generate an initial random sampling of programs. Add this
deme to the metapopulation.
2. Select a deme from the metapopulation and update its sample, as follows:
8.6 Cognitive Synergy for Procedural and Declarative Learning 155
a. Select some promising programs from the deme’s existing sample to use for modeling,
according to the scoring function.
b. Considering the promising programs as collections of knob settings, generate new collections
of knob settings by applying some (competent) optimization algorithm. For best
performance on difficult problems, it is important to use an optimization algorithm that
makes use of the system’s memory in its choices, consulting PLN inference to help
estimate which collections of knob settings will work best.
c. Convert the new collections of knob settings into their corresponding programs, reduce
the programs to normal form, evaluate their scores, and integrate them into the
deme’s sample, replacing less promising programs. In the case that scoring is expensive,
score evaluation may be preceded by score estimation, which may use PLN inference,
enaction of procedures in an internal simulation environment, and/or similarity
matching against episodic memory.
3. For each new program that meet the criterion for creating a new deme, if any:
a. Construct a new set of knobs (a process called “representation-building”) to define a
region centered around the program (the deme’s exemplar), and use it to generate a
new random sampling of programs, producing a new deme.
b. Integrate the new deme into the metapopulation, possibly displacing less promising
demes.
4. Repeat from step 2.
MOSES is a complex algorithm and each part plays its role; if any one part is removed the
performance suffers significantly [Loo06]. However, the main point we want to highlight here is
the role played by synergetic interactions between MOSES and other cognitive components such
as PLN, simulation and episodic memory, as indicated in boldface in the above pseudocode.
MOSES is a powerful procedure learning algorithm, but used on its own it runs into scalability
problems like any other such algorithm; the reason we feel it has potential to play a major role
in a human-level AI system is its capacity for productive interoperation with other cognitive
components.
Continuing the “tag” example, the power of MOSES’s integration with other cognitive processes
would come into play if, before learning to play tag, the robot has already played simpler
games involving chasing. If the robot already has experience chasing and being chased by other
agents, then its episodic and declarative memory will contain knowledge about how to pursue
and avoid other agents in the context of running around an environment full of objects, and this
knowledge will be deployable within the appropriate parts of MOSES’s Steps 1 and 2. Crossprocess
and cross-memory-type integration make it tractable for MOSES to act as a “transfer
learning” algorithm, not just a task-specific machine-learning algorithm.
8.6.2 Cognitive Synergy in PLN
While MOSES handles much of CogPrime’s procedural learning, and OpenCogPrimes internal
simulation engine handles most episodic knowledge, CogPrime’s primary tool for handling
declarative knowledge is an uncertain inference framework called Probabilistic Logic Networks
(PLN). The complexities of PLN are the topic of a lengthy technical monograph [GMIH08], and
156 8 Cognitive Synergy
here we will eschew most details and focus mainly on pointing out how PLN seeks to achieve
efficient inference control via integration with other cognitive processes.
As a logic, PLN is broadly integrative: it combines certain term logic rules with more standard
predicate logic rules, and utilizes both fuzzy truth values and a variant of imprecise probabilities
called indefinite probabilities. PLN mathematics tells how these uncertain truth values propagate
through its logic rules, so that uncertain premises give rise to conclusions with reasonably
accurately estimated uncertainty values. This careful management of uncertainty is critical for
the application of logical inference in the robotics context, where most knowledge is abstracted
from experience and is hence highly uncertain.
PLN can be used in either forward or backward chaining mode; and in the language introduced
above, it can be used for either analysis or synthesis. As an example, we will consider
backward chaining analysis, exemplified by the problem of a robot preschool-student trying to
determine whether a new playmate “Bob” is likely to be a regular visitor to its preschool or not
(evaluating the truth value of the implication Bob → regular_visitor). The basic backward
chaining process for PLN analysis looks like:
1. Given an implication L ≡ A → B whose truth value must be estimated (for instance
L ≡ C&P → G as discussed above), create a list (A 1 , ..., A n ) of (inference rule, stored
knowledge) pairs that might be used to produce L
2. Using analogical reasoning to prior inferences, assign each A i a probability of success
• If some of the A i are estimated to have reasonable probability of success at generating
reasonably confident estimates of L’s truth value, then invoke Step 1 with A i in place
of L (at this point the inference process becomes recursive)
• If none of the A i looks sufficiently likely to succeed, then inference has “gotten stuck”
and another cognitive process should be invoked, e.g.
– Concept creation may be used to infer new concepts related to A and B, and then
Step 1 may be revisited, in the hope of finding a new, more promising A i involving
one of the new concepts
– MOSES may be invoked with one of several special goals, e.g. the goal of finding
a procedure P so that P (X) predicts whether X → B. If MOSES finds such a
procedure P then this can be converted to declarative knowledge understandable
by PLN and Step 1 may be revisited....
– Simulations may be run in CogPrime’s internal simulation engine, so as to observe
the truth value of A → B in the simulations; and then Step 1 may be revisited....
The combinatorial explosion of inference control is combatted by the capability to defer to
other cognitive processes when the inference control procedure is unable to make a sufficiently
confident choice of which inference steps to take next. Note that just as MOSES may rely
on PLN to model its evolving populations of procedures, PLN may rely on MOSES to create
complex knowledge about the terms in its logical implications. This is just one example of the
multiple ways in which the different cognitive processes in CogPrime interact synergetically; a
more thorough treatment of these interactions is given in Chapter 49.
In the “new playmate” example, the interesting case is where the robot initially seems not
to know enough about Bob to make a solid inferential judgment (so that none of the A i seem
particularly promising). For instance, it might carry out a number of possible inferences and not
come to any reasonably confident conclusion, so that the reason none of the A i seem promising
is that all the decent-looking ones have been tried already. So it might then recourse to MOSES,
simulation or concept creation.
8.7 Is Cognitive Synergy Tricky? 157
For instance, the PLN controller could make a list of everyone who has been a regular
visitor, and everyone who has not been, and pose MOSES the task of figuring out a procedure
for distinguishing these two categories. This procedure could then used directly to make the
needed assessment, or else be translated into logical rules to be used within PLN inference. For
example, perhaps MOSES would discover that older males wearing ties tend not to become
regular visitors. If the new playmate is an older male wearing a tie, this is directly applicable.
But if the current playmate is wearing a tuxedo, then PLN may be helpful via reasoning that
even though a tuxedo is not a tie, it’s a similar form of fancy dress – so PLN may extend the
MOSES-learned rule to the present case and infer that the new playmate is not likely to be a
regular visitor.
8.7 Is Cognitive Synergy Tricky?
1
In this section we use the notion of cognitive synergy to explore a question that arises
frequently in the AGI community: the well-known difficulty of measuring intermediate progress
toward human-level AGI. We explore some potential reasons underlying this, via extending the
notion of cognitive synergy to a more refined notion of "tricky cognitive synergy." These ideas
are particularly relevant to the problem of creating a roadmap toward AGI, as we’ll explore in
Chapter 17 below.
8.7.1 The Puzzle: Why Is It So Hard to Measure Partial Progress
Toward Human-Level AGI?
It’s not entirely straightforward to create tests to measure the final achievement of human-level
AGI, but there are some fairly obvious candidates here. There’s the Turing Test (fooling judges
into believing you’re human, in a text chat), the video Turing Test, the Robot College Student
test (passing university, via being judged exactly the same way a human student would), etc.
There’s certainly no agreement on which is the most meaningful such goal to strive for, but
there’s broad agreement that a number of goals of this nature basically make sense.
On the other hand, how does one measure whether one is, say, 50 percent of the way to
human-level AGI? Or, say, 75 or 25 percent?
It’s possible to pose many "practical tests" of incremental progress toward human-level AGI,
with the property that if a proto-AGI system passes the test using a certain sort of architecture
and/or dynamics, then this implies a certain amount of progress toward human-level AGI based
on particular theoretical assumptions about AGI. However, in each case of such a practical test,
it seems intuitively likely to a significant percentage of AGI researchers that there is some way
to "game" the test via designing a system specifically oriented toward passing that test, and
which doesn’t constitute dramatic progress toward AGI.
Some examples of practical tests of this nature would be
1 This section co-authored with Jared Wigmore
158 8 Cognitive Synergy
• The Wozniak "coffee test": go into an average American house and figure out how to make
coffee, including identifying the coffee machine, figuring out what the buttons do, finding
the coffee in the cabinet, etc.
• Story understanding – reading a story, or watching it on video, and then answering questions
about what happened (including questions at various levels of abstraction)
• Graduating (virtual-world or robotic) preschool
• Passing the elementary school reading curriculum (which involves reading and answering
questions about some picture books as well as purely textual ones)
• Learning to play an arbitrary video game based on experience only, or based on experience
plus reading instructions
One interesting point about tests like this is that each of them seems to some AGI researchers
to encapsulate the crux of the AGI problem, and be unsolvable by any system not far along
the path to human-level AGI – yet seems to other AGI researchers, with different conceptual
perspectives, to be something probably game-able by narrow-AI methods. And of course, given
the current state of science, there’s no way to tell which of these practical tests really can be
solved via a narrow-AI approach, except by having a lot of people try really hard over a long
period of time.
A question raised by these observations is whether there is some fundamental reason why
it’s hard to make an objective, theory-independent measure of intermediate progress toward
advanced AGI. Is it just that we haven’t been smart enough to figure out the right test – or is
there some conceptual reason why the very notion of such a test is problematic?
We don’t claim to know for sure – but in the rest of this section we’ll outline one possible
reason why the latter might be the case.
8.7.2 A Possible Answer: Cognitive Synergy is Tricky!
Why might a solid, objective empirical test for intermediate progress toward AGI be an infeasible
notion? One possible reason, we suggest, is precisely cognitive synergy, as discussed
above.
The cognitive synergy hypothesis, in its simplest form, states that human-level AGI intrinsically
depends on the synergetic interaction of multiple components (for instance, as in
CogPrime, multiple memory systems each supplied with its own learning process). In this hypothesis,
for instance, it might be that there are 10 critical components required for a humanlevel
AGI system. Having all 10 of them in place results in human-level AGI, but having only
8 of them in place results in having a dramatically impaired system – and maybe having only
6 or 7 of them in place results in a system that can hardly do anything at all.
Of course, the reality is almost surely not as strict as the simplified example in the above
paragraph suggests. No AGI theorist has really posited a list of 10 crisply-defined subsystems
and claimed them necessary and sufficient for AGI. We suspect there are many different routes
to AGI, involving integration of different sorts of subsystems. However, if the cognitive synergy
hypothesis is correct, then human-level AGI behaves roughly like the simplistic example in the
prior paragraph suggests. Perhaps instead of using the 10 components, you could achieve humanlevel
AGI with 7 components, but having only 5 of these 7 would yield drastically impaired
functionality – etc. Or the point could be made without any decomposition into a finite set
of components, using continuous probability distributions. To mathematically formalize the
8.7 Is Cognitive Synergy Tricky? 159
cognitive synergy hypothesis becomes complex, but here we’re only aiming for a qualitative
argument. So for illustrative purposes, we’ll stick with the "10 components" example, just for
communicative simplicity.
Next, let’s suppose that for any given task, there are ways to achieve this task using a system
that is much simpler than any subset of size 6 drawn from the set of 10 components needed
for human-level AGI, but works much better for the task than this subset of 6 components
(assuming the latter are used as a set of only 6 components, without the other 4 components).
Note that this supposition is a good bit stronger than mere cognitive synergy. For lack of
a better name, we’ll call it tricky cognitive synergy. The tricky cognitive synergy hypothesis
would be true if, for example, the following possibilities were true:
• creating components to serve as parts of a synergetic AGI is harder than creating components
intended to serve as parts of simpler AI systems without synergetic dynamics
• components capable of serving as parts of a synergetic AGI are necessarily more complicated
than components intended to serve as parts of simpler AGI systems.
These certainly seem reasonable possibilities, since to serve as a component of a synergetic AGI
system, a component must have the internal flexibility to usefully handle interactions with a lot
of other components as well as to solve the problems that come its way. In a CogPrime context,
these possibilities ring true, in the sense that tailoring an AI process for tight integration with
other AI processes within CogPrime, tends to require more work than preparing a conceptually
similar AI process for use on its own or in a more task-specific narrow AI system.
It seems fairly obvious that, if tricky cognitive synergy really holds up as a property of
human-level general intelligence, the difficulty of formulating tests for intermediate progress
toward human-level AGI follows as a consequence. Because, according to the tricky cognitive
synergy hypothesis, any test is going to be more easily solved by some simpler narrow AI process
than by a partially complete human-level AGI system.
8.7.3 Conclusion
We haven’t proved anything here, only made some qualitative arguments. However, these arguments
do seem to give a plausible explanation for the empirical observation that positing tests
for intermediate progress toward human-level AGI is a very difficult prospect. If the theoretical
notions sketched here are correct, then this difficulty is not due to incompetence or lack
of imagination on the part of the AGI community, nor due to the primitive state of the AGI
field, but is rather intrinsic to the subject matter. And if these notions are correct, then quite
likely the future rigorous science of AGI will contain formal theorems echoing and improving
the qualitative observations and conjectures we’ve made here.
If the ideas sketched here are true, then the practical consequence for AGI development
is, very simply, that one shouldn’t worry a lot about producing intermediary results that are
compelling to skeptical observers. Just at 2/3 of a human brain may not be of much use,
similarly, 2/3 of an AGI system may not be much use. Lack of impressive intermediary results
may not imply one is on a wrong development path; and comparison with narrow AI systems on
specific tasks may be badly misleading as a gauge of incremental progress toward human-level
AGI.
160 8 Cognitive Synergy
Hopefully it’s clear that the motivation behind the line of thinking presented here is a desire
to understand the nature of general intelligence and its pursuit – not a desire to avoid testing our
AGI software! Really, as AGI engineers, we would love to have a sensible rigorous way to test our
intermediary progress toward AGI, so as to be able to pose convincing arguments to skeptics,
funding sources, potential collaborators and so forth. Our motivation here is not a desire to
avoid having the intermediate progress of our efforts measured, but rather a desire to explain
the frustrating (but by now rather well-established) difficulty of creating such intermediate
goals for human-level AGI in a meaningful way.
If we or someone else figures out a compelling way to measure partial progress toward AGI,
we will celebrate the occasion. But it seems worth seriously considering the possibility that the
difficulty in finding such a measure reflects fundamental properties of general intelligence.
From a practical CogPrime perspective, we are interested in a variety of evaluation and
testing methods, including the "virtual preschool" approach mentioned briefly above and more
extensively in later chapters. However, our focus will be on evaluation methods that give us
meaningful information about CogPrime’s progress, given our knowledge of how CogPrime
works and our understanding of the underlying theory. We are unlikely to focus on the achievement
of intermediate test results capable of convincing skeptics of the reality of our partial
progress, because we have not yet seen any credible tests of this nature, and because we suspect
the reasons for this lack may be rooted in deep properties of feasible general intelligence, such
as tricky cognitive synergy.
Chapter 9
General Intelligence in the Everyday Human
World
9.1 Introduction
Intelligence is not just about what happens inside a system, but also about what happens outside
that system, and how the system interacts with its environment. Real-world general intelligence
is about intelligence relative to some particular class of environments, and human-like general
intelligence is about intelligence relative to the particular class of environments that humans
evolved in (which in recent millennia has included environments humans have created using
their intelligence). In Chapter 2, we reviewed some specific capabilities characterizing humanlike
general intelligence; to connect these with the general theory of general intelligence from the
last few chapters, we need to explain what aspects of human-relevant environments correspond
to these human-like intelligent capabilities. We begin with aspects of the environment related
to communication, which turn out to tie in closely with cognitive synergy. Then we turn to
physical aspects of the environment, which we suspect also connect closely with various human
cognitive capabilities. Finally we turn to physical aspects of the human body and their relevance
to the human mind. In the following chapter we present a deeper, more abstract theoretical
framework encompassing these ideas.
These ideas are of theoretical importance, and they’re also of practical importance when one
turns to the critical area of AGI environment design. If one is going to do anything besides
release one’s young AGI into the “wilds” of everyday human life, then one has to put some
thought into what kind of environment it will be raised in. This may be a virtual world or it
may be a robot preschool or some other kind of physical environment, but in any case some
specific choices must be made about what to include. Specific choices must also be made about
what kind of body to give one’s AGI system – what sensors and actuators, and so forth. In
Chapter 16 we will present some specific suggestions regarding choices of embodiment and
environment that we find to be ideal for AGI development – virtual and robot preschools – but
the material in this chapter is of more general import, beyond any such particularities. If one
has an intuitive idea of what properties of body and world human intelligence is biased for,
then one can make practical choices about embodiment and environment in a principled rather
than purely ad hoc or opportunistic way.

162 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
9.2 Some Broad Properties of the Everyday World That Help
Structure Intelligence
The properties of the everyday world that help structure intelligence are diverse and span
multiple levels of abstraction. Most of this chapter will focus on fairly concrete patterns of this
nature, such as are involved in inter-agent communication and naive physics; however, it’s also
worth noting the potential importance of more abstract patterns distinguishing the everyday
world from arbitrary mathematical environments.
The propensity to search for hierarchical patterns is one huge potential example of an abstract
everyday-world property. We strongly suspect the reason that searching for hierarchical
patterns works so well, in so many everyday-world contexts, lies in the particular structure of
the everyday world – it’s not something that would be true across all possible environments
(even if one weights the space of possible environments in some clever way, say using programlength
according to some standard computational model). However, this sort of assertion is of
course highly “philosophical,” and becomes complex to formulate and defend convincingly given
the current state of science and mathematics.
Going one step further, we recall from Chapter 3 a structure called the “dual network”, which
consists of superposed hierarchical and heterarchical networks: basically a hierarchy in which
the distance between two nodes in the hierarchy is correlated with the distance between the
nodes in some metric space. Another high level property of the everyday world may be that dual
network structures are prevalent. This would imply that minds biased to represent the world in
terms of dual network structure are likely to be intelligent with respect to the everyday world.
In a different direction, the extreme commonality of symmetry groups in the (everyday and
otherwise) physical world is another example: they occur so often that minds oriented toward
recognizing patterns involving symmetry groups are likely to be intelligent with respect to the
real world.
We suspect that the number of cognitively-relevant properties of the everyday world is huge
... and that the essence of everyday-world intelligence lies in the list of varyingly abstract and
concrete properties, which must be embedded implicitly or explicitly in the structure of a natural
or artificial intelligence for that system to have everyday-world intelligence.
Apart from these particular yet abstract properties of the everyday world, intelligence is just
about “finding patterns in which actions tend to achieve which goals in which situations” ... but,
the simple meta-algorithm needed to accomplish this universally is, we suggest, only a small
percentage what it takes to make a mind.
You might say that a sufficiently generally intelligent system should be able to infer the
various cognitively-relevant properties of the environment from looking at data about the everyday
world. We agree in principle, and in fact Ben Kuipers and his colleagues have done
some interesting work in this direction, showing that learning algorithms can infer some basics
about the structure of space and time from experience [MK07]. But we suggest that doing this
really thoroughly would require a massively greater amount of processing power than an AGI
that embodies and hence automatically utilizes these principles. It may be that the problem of
inferring these properties is so hard as to require a wildly infeasible AIXI tl / Godel Machine
type system.
9.3 Embodied Communication 163
9.3 Embodied Communication
Next we turn to the potential cognitive implications of seeking to achieve goals in an environment
in which multimodal communication with other agents plays a prominent role.
Consider a community of embodied agents living in a shared world, and suppose that the
agents can communicate with each other via a set of mechanisms including:
• Linguistic communication, in a language whose semantics is largely (not necessarily
wholly) interpretable based on the mutually experienced world
• Indicative communication, in which e.g. one agent points to some part of the world or
delimits some interval of time, and another agent is able to interpret the meaning
• Demonstrative communication, in which an agent carries out a set of actions in the
world, and the other agent is able to imitate these actions, or instruct another agent as to
how to imitate these actions
• Depictive communication, in which an agent creates some sort of (visual, auditory, etc.)
construction to show another agent, with a goal of causing the other agent to experience
phenomena similar to what they would experience upon experiencing some particular entity
in the shared environment
• Intentional communication, in which an agent explicitly communicates to another agent
what its goal is in a certain situation 1
It is clear that ordinary everyday communication between humans possesses all these aspects.
We define the Embodied Communication Prior (ECP) as the probability distribution in
which the probability of an entity (e.g. a goal or environment) is proportional to the difficulty of
describing that entity, for a typical member of the community in question, using a particular set
of communication mechanisms including the above five modes. We will sometimes refer to the
prior probability of an entity under this distribution, as its “simplicity” under the distribution.
Next, to further specialize the Embodied Communication Prior, we will assume that for
each of these modes of communication, there are some aspects of the world that are much
more easily communicable using that mode than the other modes. For instance, in the human
everyday world:
• Abstract (declarative) statements spanning large classes of situations are generally much
easier to communicate linguistically
• Complex, multi-part procedures are much easier to communicate either demonstratively, or
using a combination of demonstration with other modes
• Sensory or episodic data is often much easier to communicate demonstratively
• The current value of attending to some portion of the shared environment is often much
easier to communicate indicatively
• Information about what goals to follow in a certain situation is often much easier to communicate
intentionally, i.e. via explicitly indicating what one’s own goal is
These simple observations have significant implications for the nature of the Embodied Communication
Prior. For one thing they let us define multiple forms of knowledge:
• Isolatedly declarative knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable linguistically
1 in Appendix ?? we recount some interesting recent results showing that mirror neurons fire in response to
some cases of intentional communication as thus defined
164 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
• Isolatedly procedural knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable
demonstratively
• Isolatedly sensory knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable depictively
• Isolatedly attentive knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable indicatively
• Isolatedly intentional knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable intentionally
This categorization of knowledge types resembles many ideas from the cognitive theory of
memory [TC05], although the distinctions drawn here are a little crisper than any classification
currently derivable from available neurological or psychological data.
Of course there may be much knowledge, of relevance to systems seeking intelligence according
to the ECP, that does not fall into any of these categories and constitutes “mixed knowledge.”
There are some very important specific subclasses of mixed knowledge. For instance, episodic
knowledge (knowledge about specific real or hypothetical sets of events) will most easily be
communicated via a combination of declarative, sensory and (in some cases) procedural communication.
Scientific and mathematical knowledge are generally mixed knowledge, as is most
everyday commonsense knowledge.
Some cases of mixed knowledge are reasonably well decomposable, in the sense that they
decompose into knowledge items that individually fall into some specific knowledge type. For
instance, an experimental chemistry procedure may be much more easily communicable procedurally,
whereas an allied piece of knowledge from theoretical chemistry may be much more
easily communicable declaratively; but in order to fully communicate either the experimental
procedure or the abstract piece of knowledge, one may ultimately need to communicate both
aspects.
Also, even when the best way to communicate something is mixed-mode, it may be possible
to identify one mode that poses the most important part of the communication. An example
would be a chemistry experiment that is best communicated via a practical demonstration
together with a running narrative. It may be that the demonstration without the narrative
would be vastly more valuable than the narrative without the demonstration. To cover such
cases we may make less restrictive definitions such as
• Interactively declarative knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable
in a manner dominated by linguistic communication
and so forth. We call these “interactive knowledge categories,” by contrast to the “isolated
knowledge categories” introduced earlier.
9.3.0.1 Naturalness of Knowledge Categories
Next we introduce an assumption we call NKC, for Naturalness of Knowledge Categories.
The NKC assumption states that the knowledge in each of the above isolated and interactive
communication-modality-focused categories forms a “natural category,” in the sense that
for each of these categories, there are many different properties shared by a large percentage of
the knowledge in the category, but not by a large percentage of the knowledge in the other categories.
This means that, for instance, procedural knowledge systematically (and statistically)
has different characteristics than the other kinds of knowledge.
9.3 Embodied Communication 165
The NKC assumption seems commonsensically to hold true for human everyday knowledge,
and it has fairly dramatic implications for general intelligence. Suppose we conceive general
intelligence as the ability to achieve goals in the environment shared by the communicating
agents underlying the Embodied Communication Prior. Then, NKC suggests that the best way
to achieve general intelligence according to the Embodied Communication Prior is going to
involve
• specialized methods for handling declarative, procedural, sensory and attentional knowledge
(due to the naturalness of the isolated knowledge categories)
• specialized methods for handling interactions between different types of knowledge, including
methods focused on the case where one type of knowledge is primary and the others are
supporting (the latter due to the naturalness of the interactive knowledge categories)
9.3.0.2 Cognitive Completeness
Suppose we conceive an AI system as consisting of a set of learning capabilities, each one
characterized by three features:
• One or more knowledge types that it is competent to deal with, in the sense of the two
key learning problems mentioned above
• At least one learning type: either analysis, or synthesis, or both
• At least one interaction type, for each (knowledge type, learning type) pair it handles:
“isolated” (meaning it deals mainly with that knowledge type in isolation), or “interactive”
(meaning it focuses on that knowledge type but in a way that explicitly incorporates other
knowledge types into its process), or “fully mixed” (meaning that when it deals with the
knowledge type in question, no particular knowledge type tends to dominate the learning
process).
Then, intuitively, it seems to follow from the ECP with NKC that systems with high efficient
general intelligence should have the following properties, which collectively we’ll call cognitive
completeness:
• For each (knowledge type, learning type, interaction type) triple, there should be a learning
capability corresponding to that triple.
• Furthermore the capabilities corresponding to different (knowledge type, interaction type)
pairs should have distinct characteristics (since according to the NKC the isolated knowledge
corresponding to a knowledge type is a natural category, as is the dominant knowledge
corresponding to a knowledge type)
• For each (knowledge type, learning type) pair (K,L), and each other knowledge type K1
distinct from K, there should be a distinctive capability with interaction type “interactive”
and dealing with knowledge that is interactively K but also includes aspects of K1
Furthermore, it seems intuitively sensible that according to the ECP with NKC, if the capabilities
mentioned in the above points are reasonably able, then the system possessing the
capabilities will display general intelligence relative to the ECP. Thus we arrive at the hypothesis
that
166 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
Under the assumption of the Embodied Communication Prior (with the Natural
Knowledge Categories assumption), the property above called “cognitive completeness”
is necessary and sufficient for efficient general intelligence at the level of an
inteligent adult human (e.g. at the Piagetan formal level [Pia53]).
Of course, the above considerations are very far from a rigorous mathematical proof (or
even precise formulation) of this hypothesis. But we are presenting this here as a conceptual
hypothesis, in order to qualitatively guide our practical AGI R&D and also to motivate further,
more rigorous theoretical work.
9.3.1 Generalizing the Embodied Communication Prior
One interesting direction for further research would be to broaden the scope of the inquiry, in
a manner suggested above: instead of just looking at the ECP, look at simplicity measures in
general, and attack the question of how a mind must be structured in order to display efficient
general intelligence relative to a specified simplicity measure. This problem seems unapproachable
in general, but some special cases may be more tractable.
For instance, suppose one has
• a simplicity measure that (like the ECP) is approximately decomposable into a set of fairly
distinct components, plus their interactions
• an assumption similar to NKC, which states that the entities displaying simplicity according
to each of the distinct components, are roughly clustered together in entity-space
Then one should be able to say that, to achieve efficient general intelligence relative to
this decomposable simplicity measure, a system should have distinct capabilities corresponding
to each of the components of the simplicity measure interactions between these capabilities,
corresponding to the interaction terms in the simplicity measure.
With copious additional work, these simple observations could potentially serve as the seed for
a novel sort of theory of general intelligence – a theory of how the structure of a system depends
on the structure of the simplicity measure with which it achieves efficient general intelligence.
Cognitive Synergy Theory would then emerge as a special case of this more abstract theory.
9.4 Naive Physics
Multimodal communication is an important aspect of the environment for which human intelligence
evolved – but not the only one. It seems likely that our human intelligence is also
closely adapted to various aspects of our physical environment – a matter that is worth carefully
attending as we design environments for our robotically or virtually embodied AGI systems to
operate in.
One interesting guide to the most cognitively relevant aspects of human environments is the
subfield of AI known as “naive physics” [Hay85] – a term that refers to the theories about the
physical world that human beings implicitly develop and utilize during their lives. For instance,
9.4 Naive Physics 167
when you figure out that you need to pressure the knife slightly harder when spreading peanut
butter rather than jelly, you’re not making this judgment using Newtonian physics or the
Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics; you’re using heuristic patterns that you figured out
through experience. Maybe you figured out these patterns through experience spreading peanut
butter and jelly in particular. Or maybe you figured these heuristic patterns out before you ever
tried to spread peanut butter or jelly specifically, via just touching peanut butter and jelly to
see what they feel like, and then carrying out inference based on your experience manipulating
similar tools in the context of similar substances.
Other examples of similar “naive physics” patterns are easy to come by, e.g.
1. What goes up must come down.
2. A dropped object falls straight down.
3. A vacuum sucks things towards it.
4. Centrifugal force throws rotating things outwards.
5. An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense.
6. Two events are simultaneous or they are not.
7. When running downhill, one must lift one’s knees up high.
8. When looking at something that you just barely can’t discern accurately, squint.
Attempts to axiomatically formulate naive physics have historically come up short, and we
doubt this is a promising direction for AGI. However, we do think the naive physics literature
does a good job of identifying the various phenomena that the human mind’s naive physics deals
with. So, from the point of view of AGI environment design, naive physics is a useful source
of requirements. Ideally, we would like an AGI’s environment to support all the fundamental
phenomena that naive physics deals with.
We now describe some key aspects of naive physics in a more systematic manner. Naive
physics has many different formulations; in this section we draw heavily on [SC94], who divide
naive physics phenomena into 5 categories. Here we review these categories and identify a
number of important things that humanlike intelligent agents must be able to do relative to
each of them.
9.4.1 Objects, Natural Units and Natural Kinds
One key aspect of naive physics involves recognition of various aspects of objects, such as:
1. Recognition of objects amidst noisy perceptual data
2. Recognition of surfaces and interiors of objects
3. Recognition of objects as manipulable units
4. Recognition of objects as potential subjects of fragmentation (splitting, cutting) and of
unification (gluing, bonding)
5. Recognition of the agent’s body as an object, and as parts of the agent’s body as objects
6. Division of universe of perceived objects into “natural kinds”, each containing typical and
atypical instances
168 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
9.4.2 Events, Processes and Causality
Specific aspects of naive physics related to temporality and causality are:
1. Distinguishing roughly-subjectively-instantaneous events from extended processes
2. Identifying beginnings, endings and crossings of processes
3. Identifying and distinguishing internal and external changes
4. Identifying and distinguishing internal and external changes relative to one’s own body
5. Interrelating body-changes with changes in external entities
Notably, these aspects of naive physics involve a different processes occurring on a variety of
different time scales, intersecting in complex patterns, and involving processes inside the agent’s
body, outside the agent’s body, and crossing the boundary of the agent’s body.
9.4.3 Stuffs, States of Matter, Qualities
Regarding the various states of matter, some important aspects of naive physics are:
1. Perceiving gaps between objects: holes, media, illusions like rainbows, mirages and holograms
2. Distinguishing the manners in which different sorts of entities (e.g. smells, sounds, light) fill
space
3. Distinguishing properties such as smoothness, roughness, graininess, stickiness, runniness,
etc.
4. Distinguishing degrees of elasticity and fragility
5. Assessing separability of aggregates
9.4.4 Surfaces, Limits, Boundaries, Media
Gibson [Gib77, Gib79] has argued that naive physics is not mainly about objects but rather
mainly about surfaces. Surfaces have a variety of aspects and relationships that are important
for naive physics, such as:
1. Perceiving and reasoning about surfaces as two-sided or one-sided interfaces
2. Inference of the various ecological laws of surfaces
3. Perception of various media in the world as separated by surfaces
4. Recognition of the textures of surfaces
5. Recognition of medium/surface layout relationships such as: ground, open environment,
enclosure, detached object, attached object, hollow object, place, sheet, fissure, stick, fibre,
dihedral, etc.
As a concrete, evocative “toy” example of naive everyday knowledge about surfaces and
boundaries, consider Sloman’s [Slo08a] example scenario, depicted in Figure 9.1 and drawn
largely from [SS74] (see also related discussion in [Slo08b], in which “A child can be given one
9.4 Naive Physics 169

and a rubber band to be stretched around them. Right: use of the pins and rubber band to
make a letter T.
or more rubber bands and a pile of pins, and asked to use the pins to hold the band in place to
form a particular shape)... For example, things to be learnt could include”:
1. There is an area inside the band and an area outside the band.
2. The possible effects of moving a pin that is inside the band towards or further away
from other pins inside the band. (The effects can depend on whether the band is already
stretched.)
3. The possible effects of moving a pin that is outside the band towards or further away from
other pins inside the band.
4. The possible effects of adding a new pin, inside or outside the band, with or without pushing
the band sideways with the pin first.
5. The possible effects of removing a pin, from a position inside or outside the band.
6. Patterns of motion/change that can occur and how they affect local and global shape
(e.g. introducing a concavity or convexity, introducing or removing symmetry, increasing or
decreasing the area enclosed).
7. The possibility of causing the band to cross over itself. (NB: Is an odd number of crosses
possible?)
8. How adding a second, or third band can enrich the space of structures, processes and effects
of processes.
9.4.5 What Kind of Physics Is Needed to Foster Human-like
Intelligence?
We stated above that we would like an AGI’s environment to support all the fundamental phenomena
that naive physics deals with; and we have now reviewed a number of these specific
phenomena. But it’s not entirely clear what the “fundamental” aspects underlying these phenomena
are. One important question in the environment-design context is how close an AGI
environment needs to stick to the particulars of real-world naive physics. Is it important that a
young AGI can play with the specific differences between spreading peanut butter versus jelly?
Or is it enough that it can play with spreading and smearing various substances of different
consistencies? How close does the analogy between an AGI environment’s naive physics and
170 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
real-world naive physics need to be? This is a question to which we have no scientific answer at
present. Our own working hypothesis is that the analogy does not need to be extremely close,
and with this in mind in Chapter 16 we propose a virtual environment BlocksNBeadsWorld
that encompasses all the basic conceptual phenomena of real-world naive physics, but does not
attempt to emulate their details.
Framed in terms of human psychology rather than environment design, the question becomes:
At what level of detail must one model the physical world to understand the ways in
which human intelligence has adapted to the physical world?. Our suspicion, which underlies
our BlocksNBeadsWorld design, is that it’s approximately enough to have
• Newtonian physics, or some close approximation
• Matter in multiple phases and forms vaguely similar to the ones we see in the real world:
solid, liquid, gas, paste, goo, etc.
• Ability to transform some instances of matter from one form to another
• Ability to flexibly manipulate matter in various forms with various solid tools
• Ability to combine instances of matter into new ones in a fairly rich way: e.g. glue or tie
solids togethermix liquids together, etc.
• Ability to position instances of matter with respect to each other in a rich way: e.g. put
liquid in a solid cavity, cover something with a lid or a piece of fabric, etc.
It seems to us that if the above are present in an environment, then an AGI seeking to
achieve appropriate goals in that environment will be likely to form an appropriate “humanlike
physical-world intuition." We doubt that the specifics of the naive physics of different
forms of matter are critical to human-like intelligence. But, we suspect that a great amount
of unconscious human metaphorical thinking is conditioned on the fact that humans evolved
around matter that takes a variety of forms, can be changed from one form to another, and can
be fairly easily arranged and composited to form new instances from prior ones. Without many
diverse instances of matter transformation, arrangement and composition in its experience, an
AGI is unlikely to form an internal “metaphor-base” even vaguely similar to the human one –
so that, even if it’s highly intelligent, its thinking will be radically non-human-like in character.
Naturally this is all somewhat speculative and must be explored via experimentation. Maybe
an elaborate blocks-world with only solid objects will be sufficient to create human-level, roughly
human-like AGI with rich spatiotemporal and manipulative intuition. Or maybe human intelligence
is more closely adapted to the specifics of our physical world – with water and dirt and
plants and hair and so forth – than we currently realize. One thing that is very clear is that, as
we proceed with embodying, situating and educating our AGI systems, we need to pay careful
attention to the way their intelligence is conditioned by their environment.
9.5 Folk Psychology
Related to naive physics is the notion of “naive psychology” or “folk psychology” [Rav04], which
includes for instance the following aspects:
1. Mental simulation of other agents
2. Mental theory regarding other agents
3. Attribution of beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI) to other agents via theory or simulation
9.6 Body and Mind 171
4. Recognition of emotions in other agents via their physical embodiment
5. Recognition of desires and intentions in other agents via their physical embodiment
6. Analogical and contextual inferences between self and other, regarding BDI and other aspects
7. Attribute causes and meanings to other agents behaviors
8. Anthropomorphize non-human, including inanimate objects
The main special requirement placed on an AGI’s embodiment by the above aspects pertains
to the ability of agents to express their emotions and intentions to each other. Humans do this
via facial expressions, gestures and language.
9.5.1 Motivation, Requiredness, Value
Relatedly to folk psychology, Gestalt [Koh38] and ecological [Gib77, Gib79] psychology suggest
that humans perceive the world substantially in terms of the affordances it provides them for
goal-directed action. This suggests that, to support human-like intelligence, an AGI must be
capable of:
1. Perception of entities in the world as differentially associated with goal-relevant value
2. Perception of entities in the world in terms of the potential actions they afford the agent,
or other agents
The key point is that entities in the world need to provide a wide variety of ways for agents
to interact with them, enabling richly complex perception of affordances.
9.6 Body and Mind
The above discussion has focused on the world external to the body of the AGI agent embodied
and embedded in the world, but the issue of the AGI’s body also merits consideration. There
seems little doubt that a human’s intelligence is highly conditioned by the particularities of the
human body.
9.6.1 The Human Sensorium
Here the requirements seem fairly simple: while surely not strictly necessary, it would certainly
be preferable to provide an AGI with fairly rich analogues of the human senses of touch, sight,
sound, kinesthesia, taste and smell. Each of these senses provides different sorts of cognitive
stimulation to the human mind; and while similar cognitive stimulation could doubtless be
achieved without analogous senses, the provision of such seems the most straightforward approach.
It’s hard to know how much of human intelligence is specifically biased to the sorts of
outputs provided by human senses.
As vision already is accorded such a prominent role in the AI and cognitive science literature
– and is discussed in moderate depth in Chapter 26 of Part 2, we won’t take time elaborating
172 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
on the importance of vision processing for humanlike cognition. The key thing an AGI requires
to support humanlike “visual intelligence” is an environment containing a sufficiently robust
collection of materials that object and event recognition and identification become interesting
problems.
Audition is cognitively valuable for many reasons, one of which is that it gives a very rich
and precise method of sensing the world that is different from vision. The fact that humans can
display normal intelligence while totally blind or totally deaf is an indication that, in a sense,
vision and audition are redundant for understanding the everyday world. However, it may be
important that the brain has evolved to account for both of these senses, because this forced it
to account for the presence of two very rich and precise methods of sensing the world – which
may have forced it to develop more abstract representation mechanisms than would have been
necessary with only one such method.
Touch is a sense that is, in our view, generally badly underappreciated within the AI community.
In particular the cognitive robotics community seems to worry too little about the terribly
impoverished sense of touch possessed by most current robots (though fortunately there are
recent technologies that may help improve robots in this regard; see e.g. [Nan08]). Touch is how
the human infant learns to distinguish self from other, and in this way it is the most essential
sense for the establishment of an internal self-model. Touching others’ bodies is a key method
for developing a sense of the emotional reality and responsiveness of others, and is hence key to
the development of theory of mind and social understanding in humans. For this reason, among
others, human children lacking sufficient tactile stimulation will generally wind up badly impaired
in multiple ways. A good-quality embodiment should supply an AI agent with a body
that possesses skin, which has varying levels of sensitivity on different parts of the skin (so that
it can effectively distinguish between reality and its perception thereof in a tactile context);
and also varying types of touch sensors (e.g. temperature versus friction), so that it experiences
textures as multidimensional entities.
Related to touch, kinesthesia refers to direct sensation of phenomena happening inside the
body. Rarely mentioned in AI, this sense seems quite critical to cognition, as it underpins many
of the analogies between self and other that guide cognition. Again, it’s not important that an
AGI’s virtual body have the same internal body parts as a human body. But it seems valuable
to have the AGI’s virtual body display some vaguely human-body-like properties, such as feeling
internal strain of various sorts after getting exercise, feeling discomfort in certain places when
running out of energy, feeling internally different when satisfied versus unsatisfied, etc.
Next, taste is a cognitively interesting sense in that it involves the interplay between the
internal and external world; it involves the evaluation of which entities from the external world
are worthy of placing inside the body. And smell is cognitively interesting in large part because
of its relationship with taste. A smell is, among other things, a long-distance indicator of what
a certain entity might taste like. So, the combination of taste and smell provides means for
conceptualizing relationships between self, world and distance.
9.6.2 The Human Body’s Multiple Intelligences
While most unique aspect of human intelligence is rooted in what one might call the "cognitive
cortex" – the portions of the brain dealing with self-reflection and abstract thought. But the
cognitive cortex does its work in close coordination with the body’s various more specialized
9.6 Body and Mind 173
intelligent subsystems, including those associated with the gut, the heart, the liver, the immune
and endocrine systems, and the perceptual and motor cortices.
In the perspective underlying this book, the human cognitive cortex – or the core cognitive
network of any roughly human-like AGI system – should be viewed as a highly flexible, selforganizing
network. These cognitive networks are modelable e.g. as a recurrent neural net with
general topology, or a weighted labeled hypergraph, and are centrally concerned with recognizing
patterns in its environment and itself, especially patterns regarding the achievement of the
system’s goals in various appropriate contexts. Here we augment this perspective, noting that
the human brain’s cognitive network is closely coupled with a variety of simpler and more
specialized intelligent "body-system networks" which provide it with structural and dynamical
inductive biasing. We then discuss the implications of this observation for practical AGI design.
One recalls Pascal’s famous quote "The heart has its reasons, of which reason knows not."
As we now know, the intuitive sense that Pascal and so many others have expressed, that the
heart and other body systems have their own reasons, is grounded in the fact that they actually
do carry out simple forms of reasoning (i.e. intelligent, adaptive dynamics), in close, sometimes
cognitively valuable, coordination with the central cognitive network.
9.6.2.1 Some of the Human Body’s Specialized Intelligent Subsystems
The human body contains multiple specialized intelligences apart from the cognitive cortex.
Here we review some of the most critical.
Hierarchies of Visual and Auditory Perception
. The hierarchical structure of visual and auditory cortex has been taken by some researchers
[Kur12], [HB06] as the generic structure of cognition. While we suspect this is overstated, we
agree it is important that these cortices nudge large portions of the cognitive cortex to assume
an approximately hierarchical structure.
Olfactory Attractors
. The process of recognizing a familiar smell is grounded in a neural process similar to convergence
to an attractor in a nonlinear dynamical system [Fre95]. There is evidence that the
mammalian cognitive cortex evolved in close coordination with the olfactory cortex [Row11],
and much of abstract cognition reflects a similar dynamic of gradually coming to a conclusion
based on what initially "smells right."
Physical and Cognitive Action
. The cerebellum, a specially structured brain subsystem which controls motor movements,
has for some time been understood to also have involvement in attention, executive control,
language, working memory, learning, pain, emotion, and addiction [PSF09].
174 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
The Second Brain
. The gastrointestinal neural net contains millions of neurons and is capable of operating independently
of the brain. It modulates stress response and other aspects of emotion and motivation
based on experience – resulting in so-called "gut feelings" [Ger99].
The Heart’s Neural Network
. The heart has its own neural network, which modulates stress response, energy level and
relaxation/excitement (factors key to motivation and emotion) based on experience [Arm04].
Pattern Recognition and Memory in the Liver
. The liver is a complex pattern recognition system, adapting via experience to better identify
toxins [CB06]. Like the heart, it seems to store some episodic memories as well, resulting in liver
transplant recipients sometimes acquiring the tastes in music or sports of the donor [EMC12].
Immune Intelligence
. The immune network is a highly complex, adaptive self-organizing system, which ongoingly
solves the learning problem of identifying antigens and distinguishing them from the body
system [FP86]. As immune function is highly energetically costly, stress response involves subtle
modulation of the energy allocation to immune function, which involves communication between
neural and immune networks.
The Endocrine System: A Key Bridge Between Mind and Body
. The endocrine (hormonal) system regulates (and is related by) emotion, thus guiding all
aspects of intelligence (due to the close connection of emotion and motivation) [PH12].
Breathing Guides Thinking
. As oxygenation of the brain plays a key role in the spread of neural activity, the flow of breath
is a key driver of cognition. Forced alternate nostril breathing has been shown to significantly
affect cognition via balancing activity of the two brain hemispheres [SKBB91].
Much remains unknown, and the totality of feedback loops between the human cognitive
cortex and the various specialized intelligences operative throughout the human body, has not
yet been thoroughly charted.
9.6 Body and Mind 175
9.6.2.2 Implications for AGI
What lesson should the AGI developer draw from all this? The particularities of the human
mind/body should not be taken as general requirements for general intelligence. However, it
is worth remembering just how difficult is the computational problem of learning, based on
experiential feedback alone, the right way to achieve the complex goal of controlling a system
with general intelligence at the human level or beyond. To solve this problem without some sort
of strong inductive biasing may require massively more experience than young humans obtain.
Appropriate inductive bias may be embedded in an AGI system in many different ways.
Some AGI designers have sought to embed it very explicitly, e.g. with hand-coded declarative
knowledge as in Cyc, SOAR and other "GOFAI" type systems. On the other hand, the human
brain receives its inductive bias much more subtly and implicitly, both via the specifics of the
initial structure of the cognitive cortex, and via ongoing coupling of the cognitive cortex with
other systems possessing more focused types of intelligence and more specific structures and/or
dynamics.
In building an AGI system, one has four choices, very broadly speaking:
1. Create a flexible mind-network, as unbiased as feasible, and attempt to have it learn how
to achieve its goals via experience
2. Closely emulate key aspects of the human body along with the human mind
3. Imitate the human mind-body, conceptually if not in detail, and create a number of structurally
and dynamically simpler intelligent systems closely and appropriately coupled to
the abstract cognitive mind-network, provide useful inductive bias.
4. Find some other, creative way to guide and probabilistically constrain one’s AGI system’s
mind-network, providing inductive bias appropriate to the tasks at hand, without emulating
even conceptually the way the human mind-brain receives its inductive bias via coupling
with simpler intelligent systems.
Our suspicion is that the first option will not be viable. On the other hand, to do the second
option would require more knowledge of the human body than biology currently possesses. This
leaves the third and fourth options, both of which seem viable to us.
CogPrime incorporates a combination of the third and fourth options. CogPrime’s generic
dynamic knowledge store, the Atomspace, is coupled with specialized hierarchical networks
(DeSTIN) for vision and audition, somewhat mirroring the human cortex. An artificial endocrine
system for OpenCog is also under development, speculatively, as part of a project using
OpenCog to control humanoid robots. On the other hand, OpenCog has no gastrointestinal nor
cardiological nervous system, and the stress-response-based guidance provided to the human
brain by a combination of the heart, gut, immune system and other body systems, is achieved
in CogPrime in a more explicit way using the OpenPsi model of motivated cognition, and its
integration with the system’s attention allocation dynamics.
Likely there is no single correct way to incorporate the lessons of intelligent human bodysystem
networks into AGI designs. But these are aspects of human cognition that all AGI
researchers should be aware of.
176 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World
9.7 The Extended Mind and Body
Finally, Hutchins [Hut95], Logan [Log07] and others have promoted a view of human intelligence
that views the human mind as extended beyond the individual body, incorporating social
interactions and also interactions with inanimate objects, such as tools, plants and animals.
This leads to a number of requirements for a humanlike AGI’s environment:
1. The ability to create a variety of different tools for interacting with various aspects of the
world in various different ways, including tools for making tools and ultimately machinery
2. The existence of other mobile, virtual life-forms in the world, including simpler and less
intelligent ones, and ones that interact with each other and with the AGI
3. The existence of organic growing structures in the world, with which the AGI can interact
in various ways, including halting their growth or modifying their growth pattern
How necessary these requirements are is hard to say – but it is clear that these things have
played a major role in the evolution of human intelligence.
9.8 Conclusion
Happily, this diverse chapter supports a simple, albeit tentative conclusion. Our suggestion is
that, if an AGI is
• placed in an environment capable of roughly supporting multimodal communication and
vaguely (but not necessarily precisely) real-world-ish naive physics
• surrounded with other intelligent agents of varying levels of complexity, and other complex,
dynamic structures to interface with
• given a body that can perceive this environment through some forms of sight, sound and
touch; and perceive itself via some form of kinesthesia
• given a motivational system that encourages it to make rich use of these aspects of its
environment
then the AGI is likely to have an experience-base reinforcing the key inductive biases provided
by the everyday world for the guidance of humanlike intelligence.
Chapter 10
A Mind-World Correspondence Principle
10.1 Introduction
Real-world minds are always adapted to certain classes of environments and goals. The ideas
of the previous chapter, regarding the connection between a human-like intelligence’s internals
and its environment, result from exploring the implications of this adaptation in the context
of the cognitive synergy concept. In this chapter we explore the mind-world connection in a
broader and more abstract way – making a more ambitious attempt to move toward a "general
theory of general intelligence."
One basic premise here, as in the preceding chapters is: Even a system of vast general
intelligence, subject to real-world space and time constraints, will necessarily be more efficient
at some kinds of learning than others. Thus, one approach to formulating a general theory of
general intelligence is to look at the relationship between minds and worlds – where a "world"
is conceived as an environment and a set of goals defined in terms of that environment.
In this spirit, we here formulate a broad principle binding together worlds and the minds that
are intelligent in these worlds. The ideas of the previous chapter constitute specific, concrete
instantiations of this general principle. A careful statement of the principle requires introduction
of a number of technical concepts, and will be given later on in the chapter. A crude, informal
version of the principle would be:
MIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE-PRINCIPLE
For a mind to work intelligently toward certain goals in a certain world, there should be a
nice mapping from goal-directed sequences of world-states into sequences of mind-states, where
"nice" means that a world-state-sequence W composed of two parts W 1 and W 2 , gets mapped
into a mind-state-sequence M composed of two corresponding parts M 1 and M 2 .
What’s nice about this principle is that it relates the decomposition of the world into parts,
to the decomposition of the mind into parts.
177
178 10 A Mind-World Correspondence Principle
10.2 What Might a General Theory of General Intelligence Look
Like?
It’s not clear, at this point, what a real "general theory of general intelligence" would look like
– but one tantalizing possibility is that it might confront the two questions:
• How does one design a world to foster the development of a certain sort of mind?
• How does one design a mind to match the particular challenges posed by a certain sort of
world?
One way to achieve this would be to create a theory that, given a description of an environment
and some associated goals, would output a description of the structure and dynamics that a
system should possess to be intelligent in that environment relative to those goals, using limited
computational resources.
Such a theory would serve a different purpose from the mathematical theory of "universal
intelligence" developed by Marcus Hutter [Hut05] and others. For all its beauty and theoretical
power, that approach currently gives it useful conclusions only about general intelligences
with infinite or infeasibly massive computational resources. On the other hand, the approach
suggested here is aimed toward creation of a theory of real-world general intelligences utilizing
realistic amounts of computational power, but still possessing general intelligence comparable
to human beings or greater.
This reflects a vision of intelligence as largely concerned with adaptation to particular classes
of environments and goals. This may seem contradictory to the notion of "general" intelligence,
but I think it actually embodies a realistic understanding of general intelligence. Maximally
general intelligence is not pragmatically feasible; it could only be achieved using infinite computational
resources [Hut05]. Real-world systems are inevitably limited in the intelligence they
can display in any real situation, because real situations involve finite resources, including finite
amounts of time. One may say that, in principle, a certain system could solve any problem
given enough resources and time but, even when this is true, it’s not necessarily the most interesting
way to look at the system’s intelligence. It may be more important to look at what a
system can do given the resources at its disposal in reality. And this perspective leads one to
ask questions like the ones posed above: which bounded-resources systems are well-disposed to
display intelligence in which classes of situations?
As noted in Chapter 7 above, one can assess the generality of a system’s intelligence via
looking at the entropy of the class of situations across which it displays a high level of intelligence
(where “high” is measured relative to its total level of intelligence across all situations). A system
with a high generality of intelligence will tend to be roughly equally intelligent across a wide
variety of situations; whereas a system with lower generality of intelligence will tend to be much
more intelligent in a small subclass of situations, than in any other. The definitions given above
embody this notion in a formal and quantitative way.
If one wishes to create a general theory of general intelligence according to this sort of
perspective, the main question then becomes how to represent goals/environments and systems
in such a way as to render transparent the natural correspondence between the specifics of the
former and the latter, in the context of resource-bounded intelligence. This is the business of
the next section.
10.3 Steps Toward A (Formal) General Theory of General Intelligence 179
10.3 Steps Toward A (Formal) General Theory of General Intelligence
Now begins the formalism. At this stage of development of the theory proposed in this chapter,
mathematics is used mainly as a device to ensure clarity of expression. However, once the theory
is further developed, it may possibly become useful for purposes of calculation as well.
Suppose one has any system S (which could be an AI system, or a human, or an environment
that a human or AI is interacting with, or the combination of an environment and a human or
AI’s body, etc.). One may then construct an uncertain transition graph associated with that
system S, in the following way:
• The nodes of the graph represent fuzzy sets of states of system S (I’ll call these state-sets
from here on, leaving the fuzziness implicit)
• The (directed) links of the graph represent probabilistically weighted transitions between
state-sets
Specifically, the weight of the link from B to A should be defined as
where
P (o(S, A, t(T ))|o(S, B, T ))
o(S, A, T )
denotes the presence of the system S in the state-set A during time-distribution T , and t() is
a temporal succession function defined so that t(T ) refers to a time-distribution conceived as
"after" T . A time-distribution is a probability distribution over time-points. The interaction of
fuzziness and probability here is fairly straightforward and may be handled in the manner of
PLN, as outlined in subsequent chapters. Note that the definition of link weights is dependent
on the specific implementation of the temporal succession function, which includes an implicit
time-scale.
Suppose one has a transition graph corresponding to an environment; then a goal relative to
that environment may be defined as a particular node in the transition graph. The goals of a
particular system acting in that environment may then be conceived as one or more nodes in
the transition graph. The system’s situation in the environment at any point in time may also
be associated with one or more nodes in the transition graph; then, the system’s movement
toward goal-achievement may be associated with paths through the environment’s transition
graph leading from its current state to goal states.
It may be useful for some purposes to filter the uncertain transition graph into a crisp
transition graph by placing a threshold on the link weights, and removing links with weights
below the threshold.
The next concept to introduce is the world-mind transfer function, which maps world (environment)
state-sets into organism (e.g. AI system) state-sets in a specific way. Given a world
state-set W , the world-mind transfer function M maps W into various organism state-sets with
various probabilities, so that we may say: M(W ) is the probability distribution of state-sets the
organism tends to be in, when its environment is in state-set W . (Recall also that state-sets are
fuzzy.)
Now one may look at the spaces of world-paths and mind-paths. A world-path is a path
through the world’s transition graph, and a mind-path is a path through the organism’s transi-
180 10 A Mind-World Correspondence Principle
tion graph. Given two world-paths P and Q, it’s obvious how to define the composition P ∗Q one
follows P and then, after that, follows Q, thus obtaining a longer path. Similarly for mind-paths.
In category theory terms, we are constructing the free category associated with the graph:
the objects of the category are the nodes, and the morphisms of the category are the paths.
And category theory is the right way to be thinking here we want to be thinking about the
relationship between the world category and the mind category.
The world-mind transfer function can be interpreted as a mapping from paths to subgraphs:
Given a world-path, it produces a set of mind state-sets, which have a number of links between
them. One can then define a world-mind path transfer function M(P ) via taking the mind-graph
M(nodes(P )), and looking at the highest-weight path spanning M(nodes(P )). (Here nodes?
obviously means the set of nodes of the path P .)
A functor F between the world category and the mind category is a mapping that preserves
object identities and so that
F (P ∗ Q) = F (P ) ∗ F (Q)
We may also introduce the notion of an approximate functor, meaning a mapping F so that
the average of
d(F (P ∗ Q), F (P ) ∗ F (Q))
is small.
One can introduce a prior distribution into the average here. This could be the Levin universal
distribution or some variant (the Levin distribution assigns higher probability to computationally
simpler entities). Or it could be something more purpose specific: for example, one can give
a higher weight to paths leading toward a certain set of nodes (e.g. goal nodes). Or one can
use a distribution that weights based on a combination of simplicity and directedness toward
a certain set of nodes. The latter seems most interesting, and I will define a goal-weighted approximate
functor as an approximate functor, defined with averaging relative to a distribution
that balances simplicity with directedness toward a certain set of goal nodes.
The move to approximate functors is simple conceptually, but mathematically it’s a fairly
big step, because it requires us to introduce a geometric structure on our categories. But there
are plenty of natural metrics defined on paths in graphs (weighted or not), so there’s no real
problem here.
10.4 The Mind-World Correspondence Principle
Now we finally have the formalism set up to make a non-trivial statement about the relationship
between minds and worlds. Namely, the hypothesis that:
MIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE
For an organism with a reasonably high level of intelligence in a certain world, relative to
a certain set of goals, the mind-world path transfer function is a goal-weighted approximate
functor.
10.5 How Might the Mind-World Correspondence Principle Be Useful? 181
That is, a little more loosely: the hypothesis is that, for intelligence to occur, there has to be a
natural correspondence between the transition-sequences of world-states and the corresponding
transition-sequences of mind-states, at least in the cases of transition-sequences leading to
relevant goals.
We suspect that a variant of the above proposition can be formally proved, using the definition
of general intelligence presented in Chapter 7. The proof of a theorem corresponding to the
above would certainly constitute an interesting start toward a general formal theory of general
intelligence. Note that proving anything of this nature would require some attention to the
time-scale-dependence of the link weights in the transition graphs involved.
A formally proved variant of the above proposition would be in short, a "MIND-WORLD
CORRESPONDENCE THEOREM."
Recall that at the start of the chapter, we expressed the same idea as:
MIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE-PRINCIPLE
For a mind to work intelligently toward certain goals in a certain world, there should be a
nice mapping from goal-directed sequences of world-states into sequences of mind-states, where
"nice" means that a world-state-sequence W composed of two parts W 1 and W 2 , gets mapped
into a mind-state-sequence M composed of two corresponding parts M 1 and M 2 .
That is a reasonable gloss of the principle, but it’s clunkier and less accurate, than the
statement in terms of functors and path transfer functions, because it tries to use only commonlanguage
vocabulary, which doesn’t really contain all the needed concepts.
10.5 How Might the Mind-World Correspondence Principle Be
Useful?
Suppose one believes the Mind-World Correspondence Principle as laid out above so what?
Our hope, obviously, is that the principle could be useful in actually figuring out how to
architect intelligent systems biased toward particular sorts of environment. And of course, this
is said with the understanding that any finite intelligence must be biased toward some sorts of
environment.
Relatedly, given a specific AGI design (such as CogPrime), one could use the principle to
figure out which environments it would be best suited for. Or one could figure out how to
adjust the particulars of the design, to maximize the system’s intelligence in the environments
of interest.
One next step in developing this network of ideas, aside from (and potentially building on)
full formalization of the principle, would be an exploration of real-world environments in terms
of transition graphs. What properties do the transition graphs induced from the real world
have?
One such property, we suggest, is successive refinement. Often the path toward a goal involves
first gaining an approximate understanding of a situation, then a slightly more accurate
understanding, and so forth – until finally one has achieved a detailed enough understanding to
actually achieve the goal. This would be represented by a world-path whose nodes are state-sets
involving the gathering of progressively more detailed information.
182 10 A Mind-World Correspondence Principle
Via pursuing to the mind-world correspondence property in this context, I believe we will
find that world-paths reflecting successive refinement correspond to mind-paths embodying successive
refinement. This will be found to relate to the hierarchical structures found so frequently
in both the physical world and the human mind-brain. Hierarchical structures allow many relevant
goals to be approached via successive refinement, which I believe is the ultimate reason
why hierarchical structures are so common in the human mind-brain.
Another next step would be exploring what mind-world correspondence means for the structure
and dynamics of a limited-resources intelligence. If an organism O has limited resources
and, to be intelligent, needs to make
P (o(O, M(A), t(T ))|o(O, M(B), T ))
high for particular world state-sets A and B, then what’s the organism’s best approach?
Arguably, it should represent M(A) and M(B) internally in such a way that very little computational
effort is required for it to transition between M(A) and M(B). For instance, this could
be done by coding its knowledge in such a way that M(A) and M(B) share many common bits;
or it could be done in other more complicated ways.
If, for instance, A is a subset of B, then it may prove beneficial for the organism to represent
M(A) physically as a subset of its representation of M(B).
Pursuing this line of thinking, one could likely derive specific properties of an intelligent
organism’s internal information-flow, from properties of the environment and goals with respect
to which it’s supposed to be intelligent.
This would allow us to achieve the holy grail of intelligence theory as I understand it: given
a description of an environment and goals, to be able to derive an architectural description for
an organism that will display a high level of intelligence relative to those goals, given limited
computational resources.
While this “holy grail” is obviously a far way off, what we’ve tried to do here is to outline a
clear mathematical and conceptual direction for moving toward it.
10.6 Conclusion
The Mind-World Correspondence Principle presented here – if in the vicinity of correctness –
constitutes a non-trivial step toward fleshing out the concept of a general theory of general
intelligence. But obviously the theory is still rather abstract, and also not completely rigorous.
There’s a lot more work to be done.
The Mind-World Correspondence Principle as articulated above is not quite a formal mathematical
statement. It would take a little work to put in all the needed quantifiers to formulate
it as one, and it’s not clear the best way to do so the details would perhaps become clear in the
course of trying to prove a version of it rigorously. One could interpret the ideas presented in
this chapter as a philosophical theory that hopes to be turned into a mathematical theory and
to play a key role in a scientific theory.
For the time being, the main role to be served by these ideas is qualitative: to help us think
about concrete AGI designs like CogPrime in a sensible way. It’s important to understand what
the goal of a real-world AGI system needs to be: to achieve the ability to broadly learn and
generalize, yes, but not with infinite capability rather with biases and patterns that are implicitly
and/or explicitly tuned to certain broad classes of goals and environments. The Mind-World
10.6 Conclusion 183
Correspondence Principle tells us something about what this "tuning" should involve – namely,
making a system possessing mind-state sequences that correspond meaningfully to world-state
sequences. CogPrime’s overall design and particular cognitive processes are reasonably well
interpreted as an attempt to achieve this for everyday human goals and environments.
One way of extending these theoretical ideas into a more rigorous theory is explored in Appendix
??. The key ideas involved there are: modeling multiple memory types as mathematical
categories (with functors mapping between them), modeling memory items as probability distributions,
and measuring distance between memory items using two metrics, one based on
algorithmic information theory and one on classical information geometry. Building on these
ideas, core hypotheses are then presented:
• a syntax-semantics correlation principle, stating that in a successful AGI system, these
two metrics should be roughly correlated
• a cognitive geometrodynamics principle, stating that on the whole intelligent minds
tend to follow geodesics (shortest paths) in mindspace, according to various appropriately
defined metrics (e.g. the metric measuring the distance between two entities in terms of the
length and/or runtime of the shortest programs computing one from the other).
• a cognitive synergy principle, stating that shorter paths may be found through the composite
mindspace formed by considering multiple memory types together, than by following
the geodesics in the mindspaces corresponding to individual memory types.
The material is relegated to an appendix because it is so speculative, and it’s not yet clear
whether it will really be useful in advancing or interpreting CogPrime or other AGI systems
(unlike the material from the present chapter, which has at least been useful in interpreting
and tweaking the CogPrime design, even though it can’t be claimed that CogPrime was derived
directly from these theoretical ideas). However, this sort of speculative exploration is, in our
view, exactly the sort of thing that’s needed as a first phase in transitioning the ideas of the
present chapter into a more powerful and directly actionable theory.

11.1 Introduction
Creating AGI, we have said, is not only about having the right structural and dynamical
possibilities implemented in the initial version of one’s system – but also about the environment
and embodiment that one’s system is associated with, and the match between the system’s
internals and these externals. Another key aspect is the long-term time-course of the system’s
evolution over time, both in its internals and its external interaction – i.e., what is known as
development.
Development is a critical topic in our approach to AGI because we believe that much of
what constitutes human-level, human-like intelligence emerges in an intelligent system due to
its engagement with its environment and its environment-coupled self-organization. So, it’s not
to be expected that the initial version of an AGI system is going to display impressive feats
of intelligence, even if the engineering is totally done right. A good analogy is the apparent
unintelligence of a human baby. Yes, scientists have discovered that human babies are capable
of interesting and significant intelligence – but one has to hunt to find it ... at first observation,
babies are rather idiotic and simple-minded creatures: much less intelligent-appearing than
lizards or fish, maybe even less than cockroaches....
If the goal of an AGI project is to create an AGI system that can progressively develop
advanced intelligence through learning in an environment richly populated with other agents
and various inanimate stimuli and interactive entities – then an understanding of the nature of
cognitive development becomes extremely important to that project.
Unfortunately, contemporary cognitive science contains essentially no theory of “abstract
developmental psychology” which can conveniently be applied to understand developing AIs.
There is of course an extensive science of human developmental psychology, and so it is a
natural research program to take the chief ideas from the former and inasmuch as possible port
them to the AGI domain. This is not an entirely simple matter both because of the differences
between humans and AIs and because of the unsettled nature of contemporary developmental
psychology theory. But it’s a job that must (and will) be done, and the ideas in this chapter
may contribute toward this effort.
We will begin here with Piaget’s well-known theory of human cognitive development, presenting
it in a general systems theory context, then introducing some modifications and extensions
and discussing some other relevant work.

188 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
11.2 Piagetan Stages in the Context of a General Systems Theory of
Development
Our review of AGI architectures in Chapter 4 focused heavily on the concept of symbolism,
and the different ways in which different classes of cognitive architecture handle symbol representation
and manipulation. We also feel that symbolism is critical to the notion of AGI
development – and even more broadly, to the systems theory of development in general.
As a broad conceptual perspective on development, we suggest that one may view the development
of a complex information processing system, embedded in an environment, in terms
of the stages:
• automatic: the system interacts with the environment by “instinct”, according to its innate
programming
• adaptive: the system internally adapts to the environment, then interacting with the environment
in a more appropriate way
• symbolic: the system creates internal symbolic representations of itself and the environment,
which in the case of a complex, appropriately structured environment, allows it to
interact with the environment more intelligently
• reflexive: the system creates internal symbolic representations of its own internal symbolic
representations, thus achieving an even higher degree of intelligence
Sketched so broadly, these are not precisely defined categories but rather heuristic, intuitive
categories. Formalizing them would be possible but would lead us too far astray here.
One can interpret these stages in a variety of different contexts. Here our focus is the cognitive
development of humans and human-like AGI systems, but in Table 11.1 we present them in
a slightly more general context, using two examples: the Piagetan example of the human (or
humanlike) mind as it develops from infancy to maturity; and also the example of the “origin
of life” and the development of life from proto-life up into its modern form. In any event, we
allude to this more general perspective on development here mainly to indicate our view that
the Piagetan perspective is not something ad hoc and arbitrary, but rather can plausibly be seen
as a specific manifestation of more fundamental principles of complex systems development.
11.3 Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development
The ghost of Jean Piaget hangs over modern developmental psychology in a yet unresolved
way. Piaget’s theories provide a cogent overarching perspective on human cognitive development,
coordinating broad theoretical ideas and diverse experimental results into a unified whole
[Pia55]. Modern experimental work has shown Piaget’s ideas to be often oversimplified and incorrect.
However, what has replaced the Piagetan understanding is not an alternative unified
and coherent theory, but a variety of microtheories addressing particular aspects of cognitive
development. For this reason a number of contemporary theorists taking a computer science
[Shu03] or dynamical systems [Wit07] approach to developmental psychology have chosen to
adopt the Piagetan framework in spite of its demonstrated shortcomings, both because of its
conceptual strengths and for lack of a coherent, more rigorously grounded alternative.
Our own position is that the Piagetan view of development has some fundamental truth to it,
which is reflected via how nicely it fits with a broader view of development in complex systems.

Table 11.1: General Systems Theory of Development: Parallels Between Development of Mind
and Origin of Life
Indeed, Piaget viewed developmental stages as emerging from general “algebraic” principles
rather than as being artifacts of the particulars of human psychology. But, Piaget’s stages are
probably best viewed as a general interpretive framework rather than a precise scientific theory.
Our suspicion is that once the empirical science of developmental psychology has progressed
further, it will become clearer how to fit the various data into a broad Piaget-like framework,
perhaps differing in many details from what Piaget described in his works.
Piaget conceived of child development in four stages, each roughly identified with an age
group, and corresponding closely to the system-theoretic stages mentioned above:
• infantile, corresponding to the automatic stage mentioned above
– Example: Grasping blocks, piling blocks on top of each other, copying words that are
heard
• preoperational and concrete operational, corresponding to the adaptive stage mentioned
above
– Example: Building complex blocks structures, from imagination and from imitating
objects and pictures and based on verbal instructions; verbally describing what has
been constructed
• formal, corresponding to the symbolic stage mentioned above
– Example: Writing detailed instructions in words and diagrams, explaining how to construct
particular structures out of blocks; figuring out general rules describing which
sorts of blocks structures are likely to be most stable
190 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
• the reflexive stage mentioned above corresponds to what some post-Piagetan theorists have
called the post-formal stage
– Example: Using abstract lessons learned from building structures out of blocks to guide
the construction of new ways to think and understand – “Zen and the art of blocks
building” (by analogy to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance [Pir84]).
Fig. 11.1: Piagetan Stages of Cognitive Development
More explicitly, Piaget defined his stages in psychological terms roughly as follows:
• Infantile: In this stage a mind develops basic world-exploration driven by instinctive actions.
Reward-driven reinforcement of actions learned by imitation, simple associations between
words and objects, actions and images, and the basic notions of time, space, and
causality are developed. The most simple, practical ideas and strategies for action are
learned.
• Preoperational: At this stage we see the formation of mental representations, mostly
poorly organized and un-abstracted, building mainly on intuitive rather than logical thinking.
Word-object and image-object associations become systematic rather than occasional.
Simple syntax is mastered, including an understanding of subject-argument relationships.
One of the crucial learning achievements here is “object permanence” – infants learn that
objects persist even when not observed. However, a number of cognitive failings persist with
respect to reasoning about logical operations, and abstracting the effects of intuitive actions
to an abstract theory of operations.
• Concrete: More abstract logical thought is applied to the physical world at this stage.
Among the feats achieved here are: reversibility – the ability to undo steps already done;
conservation – understanding that properties can persist in spite of appearances; theory of
mind – an understanding of the distinction between what I know and what others know (If
11.3 Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development 191
I cover my eyes, can you still see me?). Complex concrete operations, such as putting items
in height order, are easily achievable. Classification becomes more sophisticated, yet the
mind still cannot master purely logical operations based on abstract logical representations
of the observational world.
• Formal: Abstract deductive reasoning, the process of forming, then testing hypotheses, and
systematically reevaluating and refining solutions, develops at this stage, as does the ability
to reason about purely abstract concepts without reference to concrete physical objects.
This is adult human-level intelligence. Note that the capability for formal operations is
intrinsic in the PLN component of CogPrime, but in-principle capability is not the same as
pragmatic, grounded, controllable capability.
Very early on, Vygotsky [Vyg86] disagreed with Piaget’s explanation of his stages as inherent
and developed by the child’s own activities, and Piaget’s prescription of good parenting as
not interfering with a child’s unfettered exploration of the world. Some modern theorists have
critiqued Piaget’s stages as being insufficiently socially grounded, and these criticisms trace back
to Vygotsky’s focus on the social foundations of intelligence, on the fact that children function
in a world surrounded by adults who provide a cultural context, offering ongoing assistance,
critique, and ultimately validation of the child’s developmental activities.
Vygotsky also was an early critic of the idea that cognitive development is continuous,
and continues beyond Piaget’s formal stage. Gagne [RBW92] also believes in continuity, and
that learning of prerequisite skills made the learning of subsequent skills easier and faster
without regard to Piagetan stage formalisms. Subsequent researchers have argued that Piaget
has merely constructed ad hoc descriptions of the sequential development of behaviour
[Gib78, Bro84, CP05]. We agree that learning is a continuous process, and our notion of stages
is more statistically constructed than rigidly quantized.
Critique of Piaget’s notion of transitional “half stages” is also relevant to a more comprehensive
hierarchical view of development. Some have proposed that Piaget’s half stages are
actually stages [Bro84]. As Commons and Pekker [CP05] point out: “the definition of a stage
that was being used by Piaget was based on analyzing behaviors and attempting to impose
different structures on them. There is no underlying logical or mathematical definition to help
in this process . . . ” Their Hierarchical Complexity development model uses task achievement
rather than ad hoc stage definition as the basis for constructing relationships between phases
of developmental ability – an approach which we find useful, though our approach is different
in that we define stages in terms of specific underlying cognitive mechanisms.
Another critique of Piaget is that one individual’s performance is often at different ability
stages depending on the specific task (for example [GE86]). Piaget responded to early critiques
along these lines by calling the phenomenon “horizontal décalage,” but neither he nor his successors
[Fis80, Cas85] have modified his theory to explain (rather than merely describe) it.
Similarly to Thelen and Smith [TS94], we observe that the abilities encapsulated in the definition
of a certain stage emerge gradually during the previous stage – so that the onset of a given
stage represents the mastery of a cognitive skill that was previously present only in certain
contexts.
Piaget also had difficulty accepting the idea of a preheuristic stage, early in the infantile
period, in which simple trial-and-error learning occurs without significant heuristic guidance
[Bic88], a stage which we suspect exists and allows formulation of heuristics by aggregation of
learning from preheuristic pattern mining. Coupled with his belief that a mind’s innate abilities
at birth are extremely limited, there is a troublingly unexplained transition from inability to
ability in his model.
192 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
Finally, another limiting aspect of Piaget’s model is that it did not recognize any stages
beyond formal operations, and included no provisions for exploring this possibility. A number of
researchers [Bic88, Arl75, CRK82, Rie73, Mar01] have described one or more postformal stages.
Commons and colleagues have also proposed a task-based model which provides a framework for
explaining stage discrepancies across tasks and for generating new stages based on classification
of observed logical behaviors. [KK90] promotes a statistical conception of stage, which provides a
good bridge between task-based and stage-based models of development, as statistical modeling
allows for stages to be roughly defined and analyzed based on collections of task behaviors.
[CRK82] postulates the existence of a postformal stage by observing elevated levels of abstraction
which, they argue, are not manifested in formal thought. [CTS + 98] observes a postformal
stage when subjects become capable of analyzing and coordinating complex logical systems
with each other, creating metatheoretical supersystems. In our model, with the reflexive stage
of development, we expand this definition of metasystemic thinking to include the ability to
consciously refine one’s own mental states and formalisms of thinking. Such self-reflexive refinement
is necessary for learning which would allow a mind to analytically devise entirely new
structures and methodologies for both formal and postformal thinking.
In spite of these various critiques and limitations, however, we have found Piaget’s ideas
very useful, and in Section 11.4 we will explore ways of defining them rigorously in the specific
context of CogPrime’s declarative knowledge store and probabilistic logic engine.
11.3.1 Perry’s Stages
Also relevant is William Perry’s [Per70, Per81] theory of the stages (“positions” in his terminology)
of intellectual and ethical development, which constitutes a model of iterative refinement
of approach in the developmental process of coming to intellectual and ethical maturity. These
stages, depicted in Table 11.2 form an analytical tool for discerning the modality of belief of
an intelligence by describing common cognitive approaches to handling the complexities of real
world ethical considerations.
11.3.2 Keeping Continuity in Mind
Continuity of mental stages, and the fact that a mind may appear to be in multiple stages
of development simultaneously (depending upon the tasks being tested), are crucial to our
theoretical formulations and we will touch upon them again here. Piaget attempted to address
continuity with the creation of transitional “half stages”. We prefer to observe that each stage
feeds into the other and the end of one stage and the beginning of the next blend together.
The distinction between formal and post-formal, for example, seems to “merely” be the
application of formal thought to oneself. However, the distinction between concrete and formal is
“merely” the buildup to higher levels of complexity of the classification, task decomposition, and
abstraction capabilities of the concrete stage. The stages represent general trends in ability on
a continuous curve of development, not discrete states of mind which are jumped-into quantum
style after enough “knowledge energy” builds-up to cause the transition.

Table 11.2: Perry’s Developmental Stages [with corresponding Piagetan Stages in brackets]
Observationally, this appears to be the case in humans. People learn things gradually, and
show a continuous development in ability, not a quick jump from ignorance to mastery. We
believe that this gradual development of ability is the signature of genuine learning, and that
prescriptively an AGI system must be designed in order to have continuous and asymmetrical
development across a variety of tasks in order to be considered a genuine learning system. While
quantum leaps in ability may be possible in an AGI system which can just “graft” new parts
of brain onto itself (or an augmented human which may someday be able to do the same using
implants), such acquisition of knowledge is not really learning. Grafting on knowledge does not
build the cognitive pathways needed in order to actually learn. If this is the only mechanism
available to an AGI system to acquire new knowledge, then it is not really a learning system.
11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference
Piaget’s developmental stages are very general, referring to overall types of learning, not specific
mechanisms or methods. This focus was natural since the context of his work was human developmental
psychology, and neuroscience has not yet progressed to the point of understanding
the neural mechanisms underlying any sort of inference (and certainly was nowhere near to
doing so in Piaget’s time!). But if one is studying developmental psychology in an AGI context
where one knows something about the internal mechanisms of the AGI system under consideration,
then one can work with a more specific model of learning. Our focus here is on AGI
systems whose operations contain uncertain inference as a central component. Obviously the
main focus is CogPrime, but the essential ideas apply to any other uncertain inference centric
AGI architecture as well.
194 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
Fig. 11.2: Piagetan Stages of Development, as Manifested in the Context of Uncertain Inference
An uncertain inference system, as we consider it here, consists of four components, which
work together in a feedback-control loop 11.3
1. a content representation scheme
2. an uncertainty representation scheme
3. a set of inference rules
4. a set of inference control schemata
Fig. 11.3: A Simplified Look at Feedback-Control in Uncertain Inference
11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference 195
Broadly speaking, examples of content representation schemes are predicate logic and term
logic [ES00]. Examples of uncertainty representation schemes are fuzzy logic [Zad78], imprecise
probability theory [Goo86, FC86], Dempster-Shafer theory [Sha76, Kyb97], Bayesian probability
theory [Kyb97], NARS [Wan95], and the Atom representation used in CogPrime, briefly alluded
to in Chapter 6 above and described in depth in later chapters.
Many, but not all, approaches to uncertain inference involve only a limited, weak set of inference
rules (e.g. not dealing with complex quantified expressions). CogPrime’s PLN inference
framework, like NARS and some other uncertain inference frameworks, contains uncertain inference
rules that apply to logical constructs of arbitrary complexity. Only a system capable of
dealing with constructs of arbitrary (or at least very high) complexity will have any potential
of leading to human-level, human-like intelligence.
The subtlest part of uncertain inference is inference control: the choice of which inferences
to do, in what order. Inference control is the primary area in which human inference currently
exceeds automated inference. Humans are not very efficient or accurate at carrying out inference
rules, with or without uncertainty, but we are very good at determining which inferences to do
and in what order, in any given context. The lack of effective, context-sensitive inference control
heuristics is why the general ability of current automated theorem provers is considerably weaker
than that of a mediocre university mathematics major [Mac95].
We now review the Piagetan developmental stages from the perspective of AGI systems
heavily based on uncertain inference.
11.4.1 The Infantile Stage
In this initial stage, the mind is able to recognize patterns in and conduct inferences about
the world, but only using simplistic hard-wired (not experientially learned) inference control
schema, along with pre-heuristic pattern mining of experiential data.
In the infantile stage an entity is able to recognize patterns in and conduct inferences about
its sensory surround context (i.e., it’s “world”), but only using simplistic, hard-wired (not experientially
learned) inference control schemata. Preheuristic pattern-mining of experiential data
is performed in order to build future heuristics about analysis of and interaction with the world.
s tasks include:
1. Exploratory behavior in which useful and useless / dangerous behavior is differentiated by
both trial and error observation, and by parental guidance.
2. Development of “habits” – i.e. Repeating tasks which were successful once to determine if
they always / usually are so.
3. Simple goal-oriented behavior such as “find out what cat hair tastes like” in which one must
plan and take several sequentially dependent steps in order to achieve the goal.
Inference control is very simple during the infantile stage (Figure 11.4), as it is the stage
during which both the most basic knowledge of the world is acquired, and the most basic of
cognition and inference control structures are developed as the building block upon which will
be built the next stages of both knowledge and inference control.
Another example of a cognitive task at the borderline between infantile and concrete cognition
is learning object permanence, a problem discussed in the context of CogPrime’s predecessor
"Novamente Cognition Engine" system in [GPSL03]. Another example is the learning of
196 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
Fig. 11.4: Uncertain Inference in the Infantile Stage
word-object associations: e.g. learning that when the word “ball” is uttered in various contexts
(“Get me the ball,” “That’s a nice ball,” etc.) it generally refers to a certain type of object.
The key point regarding these “infantile” inference problems, from the CogPrime perspective,
is that assuming one provides the inference system with an appropriate set of perceptual and
motor ConceptNodes and SchemaNodes, the chains of inference involved are short. They involve
about a dozen inferences, and this means that the search tree of possible PLN inference rules
walked by the PLN backward-chainer is relatively shallow. Sophisticated inference control is
not required: standard AI heuristics are sufficient.
In short, textbook narrow-AI reasoning methods, utilized with appropriate uncertainty-savvy
truth value formulas and coupled with appropriate representations of perceptual and motor
inputs and outputs, correspond roughly to Piaget’s infantile stage of cognition. The simplistic
approach of these narrow-AI methods may be viewed as a method of creating building blocks
for subsequent, more sophisticated heuristics.
In our theory Piaget’s preoperational phase appears as transitional between the infantile and
concrete operational phases.
11.4.2 The Concrete Stage
At this stage, the mind is able to carry out more complex chains of reasoning regarding the
world, via using inference control schemata that adapt behavior based on experience (reasoning
about a given case in a manner similar to prior cases).
In the concrete operational stage (Figure 11.5), an entity is able to carry out more complex
chains of reasoning about the world. Inference control schemata which adapt behavior based on
experience, using experientially learned heuristics (including those learned in the prior stage),
are applied to both analysis of and interaction with the sensory surround / world.
Concrete Operational stage tasks include:
11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference 197
Fig. 11.5: Uncertain Inference in the Concrete Operational Stage
1. Conservation tasks, such as conservation of number,
2. Decomposition of complex tasks into easier subtasks, allowing increasingly complex tasks
to be approached by association with more easily understood (and previously experienced)
smaller tasks,
3. Classification and Serialization tasks, in which the mind can cognitively distinguish various
disambiguation criteria and group or order objects accordingly.
In terms of inference control this is the stage in which actual knowledge about how to control
inference itself is first explored. This means an emerging understanding of inference itself as a
cognitive task and methods for learning, which will be further developed in the following stages.
Also, in this stage a special cognitive task capability is gained: “Theory of Mind," which in
cognitive science refers to the ability to understand the fact that not only oneself, but other
sentient beings have memories, perceptions, and experiences. This is the ability to conceptually
“put oneself in another’s shoes” (even if you happen to assume incorrectly about them by doing
so).
11.4.2.1 Conservation of Number
Conservation of number is an example of a learning problem classically categorized within
Piaget’s concrete-operational phase, a “conservation laws” problem, discussed in [Shu03] in
the context of software that solves the problem using (logic-based and neural net) narrow-AI
techniques. Conservation laws are very important to cognitive development.
Conservation is the idea that a quantity remains the same despite changes in appearance. If
you show a child some objects and then spread them out, an infantile mind will focus on the
spread, and believe that there are now more objects than before, whereas a concrete-operational
mind will understand that the quantity of objects has not changed.
Conservation of number seems very simple, but from a developmental perspective it is actually
rather difficult. “Solutions” like those given in [Shu03] that use neural networks or cus-
198 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
tomized logical rule-bases to find specialized solutions that solve only this problem fail to fully
address the issue, because these solutions don’t create knowledge adequate to aid with the
solution of related sorts of problems.
We hypothesize that this problem is hard enough that for an inference-based AGI system
to solve it in a developmentally useful way, its inferences must be guided by meta-inferential
lessons learned from prior similar problems. When approaching a number conservation problem,
for example, a reasoning system might draw upon past experience with set-size problems (which
may be trial-and-error experience). This is not a simple “machine learning” approach whose
scope is restricted to the current problem, but rather a heuristically guided approach which (a)
aggregates information from prior experience to guide solution formulation for the problem at
hand, and (b) adds the present experience to the set of relevant information about quantification
problems for future refinement of thinking.
Fig. 11.6: Conservation of Number
For instance, a very simple context-specific heuristic that a system might learn would be:
“When evaluating the truth value of a statement related to the number of objects in a set,
it is generally not that useful to explore branches of the backwards-chaining search tree that
contain relationships regarding the sizes, masses, or other physical properties of the objects in
the set.” This heuristic itself may go a long way toward guiding an inference process toward a
correct solution to the problem–but it is not something that a mind needs to know “a priori.”
A concrete-operational stage mind may learn this by data-mining prior instances of inferences
involving sizes of sets. Without such experience-based heuristics, the search tree for such a
problem will likely be unacceptably large. Even if it is “solvable” without such heuristics, the
solutions found may be overly fit to the particular problem and not usefully generalizable.
11.4.2.2 Theory of Mind
Consider this experiment: a preoperational child is shown her favorite “Dora the Explorer” DVD
box. Asked what show she’s about to see, she’ll answer “Dora.” However, when her parent plays
the disc, it’s “SpongeBob SquarePants.” If you then ask her what show her friend will expect
when given the “Dora” DVD box, she will respond “SpongeBob” although she just answered
“Dora” for herself. A child lacking a theory of mind can not reason through what someone
else would think given knowledge other than her own current knowledge. Knowledge of self is
intrinsically related to the ability to differentiate oneself from others, and this ability may not
be fully developed at birth.
Several theorists [BC94, Fod94], based in part on experimental work with autistic children,
perceive theory of mind as embodied in an innate module of the mind activated at a certain
developmental stage (or not, if damaged). While we consider this possible, we caution against
adopting a simplistic view of the “innate vs. acquired” dichotomy: if there is innateness it may
take the form of an innate predisposition to certain sorts of learning [EBJ + 97].
11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference 199
Davidson [Dav84], Dennett [Den87] and others support the common belief that theory of
mind is dependent upon linguistic ability. A major challenge to this prevailing philosophical
stance came from Premack and Woodruff [PW78] who postulated that prelinguistic primates
do indeed exhibit “theory of mind” behavior. While Premack and Woodruff’s experiment itself
has been challenged, their general result has been bolstered by follow-up work showing similar
results such as [TC97]. It seems to us that while theory of mind depends on many of the same
inferential capabilities as language learning, it is not intrinsically dependent on the latter.
There is a school of thought often called the Theory Theory [BW88, Car85, Wel90] holding
that a child’s understanding of mind is best understood in terms of the process of iteratively
formulating and refuting a series of naive theories about others. Alternately, Gordon [Gor86]
postulates that theory of mind is related to the ability to run cognitive simulations of others’
minds using one’s own mind as a model. We suggest that these two approaches are actually
quite harmonious with one another. In an uncertain AGI context, both theories and simulations
are grounded in collections of uncertain implications, which may be assembled in contextappropriate
ways to form theoretical conclusions or to drive simulations. Even if there is a
special “mind-simulator” dynamic in the human brain that carries out simulations of other
minds in a manner fundamentally different from explicit inferential theorizing, the inputs to
and the behavior of this simulator may take inferential form, so that the simulator is in essence
a way of efficiently and implicitly producing uncertain inferential conclusions from uncertain
premises.
We have thought through the details by CogPrime system should be able to develop theory
of mind via embodied experience, though at time of writing practical learning experiments in
this direction have not yet been done. We have not yet explored in detail the possibility of giving
CogPrime a special, elaborately engineered “mind-simulator” component, though this would be
possible; instead we have initially been pursuing a more purely inferential approach.
First, it is very simple for a CogPrime system to learn patterns such as “If I rotated by pi
radians, I would see the yellow block.” And it’s not a big leap for PLN to go from this to the
recognition that “You look like me, and you’re rotated by pi radians relative to my orientation,
therefore you probably see the yellow block.” The only nontrivial aspect here is the “you look
like me” premise.
Recognizing “embodied agent” as a category, however, is a problem fairly similar to recognizing
“block” or “insect” or “daisy” as a category. Since the CogPrime agent can perceive most
parts of its own “robot” body–its arms, its legs, etc.–it should be easy for the agent to figure
out that physical objects like these look different depending upon its distance from them and
its angle of observation. From this it should not be that difficult for the agent to understand
that it is naturally grouped together with other embodied agents (like its teacher), not with
blocks or bugs.
The only other major ingredient needed to enable theory of mind is “reflection”– the ability of
the system to explicitly recognize the existence of knowledge in its own mind (note that this term
“reflection” is not the same as our proposed “reflexive” stage of cognitive development). This
exists automatically in CogPrime, via the built-in vocabulary of elementary procedures supplied
for use within SchemaNodes (specifically, the atTime and TruthValue operators). Observing that
“at time T, the weight of evidence of the link L increased from zero” is basically equivalent to
observing that the link L was created at time T.
Then, the system may reason, for example, as follows (using a combination of several PLN
rules including the above-given deduction rule):
200 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
Implication
My eye is facing a block and it is not dark
A relationship is created describing the block’s color
Similarity
My body
My teacher’s body
|-
Implication
My teacher’s eye is facing a block and it is not dark
A relationship is created describing the block’s color
This sort of inference is the essence of Piagetan “theory of mind.” Note that in both of
these implications the created relationship is represented as a variable rather than a specific
relationship. The cognitive leap is that in the latter case the relationship actually exists in the
teacher’s implicitly hypothesized mind, rather than in CogPrime’s mind. No explicit hypothesis
or model of the teacher’s mind need be created in order to form this implication–the hypothesis
is created implicitly via inferential abstraction. Yet, a collection of implications of this nature
may be used via an uncertain reasoning system like PLN to create theories and simulations
suitable to guide complex inferences about other minds.
From the perspective of developmental stages, the key point here is that in a CogPrime
context this sort of inference is too complex to be viably carried out via simple inference
heuristics. This particular example must be done via forward chaining, since the big leap is to
actually think of forming the implication that concludes inference. But there are simply too
many combinations of relationships involving CogPrime’s eye, body, and so forth for the PLN
component to viably explore all of them via standard forward-chaining heuristics. Experienceguided
heuristics are needed, such as the heuristic that if physical objects A and B are generally
physically and functionally similar, and there is a relationship involving some part of A and
some physical object R, it may be useful to look for similar relationships involving an analogous
part of B and objects similar to R. This kind of heuristic may be learned by experience–and the
masterful deployment of such heuristics to guide inference is what we hypothesize to characterize
the concrete stage of development. The “concreteness” comes from the fact that inference control
is guided by analogies to prior similar situations.
11.4.3 The Formal Stage
In the formal stage, as shown in Figure 11.7, an agent should be able to carry out arbitrarily
complex inferences (constrained only by computational resources, rather than by fundamental
restrictions on logical language or form) via including inference control as an explicit subject of
abstract learning. Abstraction and inference about both the sensorimotor surround (world) and
about abstract ideals themselves (including the final stages of indirect learning about inference
itself) are fully developed.
Formal stage evaluation tasks are centered entirely around abstraction and higher-order
inference tasks such as:
1. Mathematics and other formalizations.
11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference 201
Fig. 11.7: Uncertain Inference in the Formal Stage
2. Scientific experimentation and other rigorous observational testing of abstract formalizations.
3. Social and philosophical modeling, and other advanced applications of empathy and the
Theory of Mind.
In terms of inference control this stage sees not just perception of new knowledge about
inference control itself, but inference controlled reasoning about that knowledge and the creation
of abstract formalizations about inference control which are reasoned-upon, tested, and verified
or debunked.
11.4.3.1 Systematic Experimentation
The Piagetan formal phase is a particularly subtle one from the perspective of uncertain inference.
In a sense, AGI inference engines already have strong capability for formal reasoning
built in. Ironically, however, no existing inference engine is capable of deploying its reasoning
rules in a powerfully effective way, and this is because of the lack of inference control heuristics
adequate for controlling abstract formal reasoning. These heuristics are what arise during
Piaget’s formal stage, and we propose that in the content of uncertain inference systems, they
involve the application of inference itself to the problem of refining inference control.
202 11 Stages of Cognitive Development
A problem commonly used to illustrate the difference between the Piagetan concrete operational
and formal stages is that of figuring out the rules for making pendulums swing quickly
versus slowly [IP58]. If you ask a child in the formal stage to solve this problem, she may proceed
to do a number of experiments, e.g. build a long string with a light weight, a long string
with a heavy weight, a short string with a light weight and a short string with a heavy weight.
Through these experiments she may determine that a short string leads to a fast swing, a long
string leads to a slow swing, and the weight doesn’t matter at all.
The role of experiments like this, which test “extreme cases,” is to make cognition easier. The
formal-stage mind tries to map a concrete situation onto a maximally simple and manipulable
set of abstract propositions, and then reason based on these. Doing this, however, requires an
automated and instinctive understanding of the reasoning process itself. The above-described
experiments are good ones for solving the pendulum problem because they provide data that
is very easy to reason about. From the perspective of uncertain inference systems, this is the
key characteristic of the formal stage: formal cognition approaches problems in a way explicitly
calculated to yield tractable inferences.
Note that this is quite different from saying that formal cognition involves abstractions and
advanced logic. In an uncertain logic-based AGI system, even infantile cognition may involve
these – the difference lies in the level of inference control, which in the infantile stage is simplistic
and hard-wired, but in the formal stage is based on an understanding of what sorts of inputs
lead to tractable inference in a given context.
11.4.4 The Reflexive Stage
In the reflexive stage (Figure 11.8), an intelligent agent is broadly capable of self-modifying its
internal structures and dynamics.
As an example in the human domain: highly intelligent and self-aware adult humans may
carry out reflexive cognition by explicitly reflecting upon their own inference processes and
trying to improve them. An example is the intelligent improvement of uncertain-truth-valuemanipulation
formulas. It is well demonstrated that even educated humans typically make
numerous errors in probabilistic reasoning [GGK02]. Most people don’t realize it and continue
to systematically make these errors throughout their lives. However, a small percentage of
individuals make an explicit effort to increase their accuracy in making probabilistic judgments
by consciously endeavoring to internalize the rules of probabilistic inference into their automated
cognition processes.
In the uncertain inference based AGI context, what this means is: In the reflexive stage
an entity is able to include inference control itself as an explicit subject of abstract learning
(i.e. the ability to reason about one’s own tactical and strategic approach to modifying one’s
own learning and thinking), and modify these inference control strategies based on analysis of
experience with various cognitive approaches.
Ultimately, the entity can self-modify its internal cognitive structures. Any knowledge or
heuristics can be revised, including metatheoretical and metasystemic thought itself. Initially
this is done indirectly, but at least in the case of AGI systems it is theoretically possible to
also do so directly. This might be considered as a separate stage of Full Self Modification, or
else as the end phase of the reflexive stage. In the context of logical reasoning, self modification
of inference control itself is the primary task in this stage. In terms of inference control this
11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference 203
Fig. 11.8: The Reflexive Stage
stage adds an entire new feedback loop for reasoning about inference control itself, as shown in
Figure 11.8.
As a very concrete example, in later chapters we will see that, while PLN is founded on
probability theory, it also contains a variety of heuristic assumptions that inevitably introduce a
certain amount of error into its inferences. For example, PLN’s probabilistic deduction embodies
a heuristic independence assumption. Thus PLN contains an alternate deduction formula called
the “concept geometry formula” that is better in some contexts, based on the assumption that
ConceptNodes embody concepts that are roughly spherically-shaped in attribute space. A highly
advanced CogPrime system could potentially augment the independence-based and conceptgeometry-based
deduction formulas with additional formulas of its own derivation, optimized
to minimize error in various contexts. This is a simple and straightforward example of reflexive
cognition – it illustrates the power accessible to a cognitive system that has formalized and
reflected upon its own inference processes, and that possesses at least some capability to modify
these.
In general, AGI systems can be expected to have much broader and deeper capabilities for
self-modification than human beings. Ultimately it may make sense to view the AGI systems
we implement as merely "initial conditions" for ongoing self-modification and self-organization.
Chapter ?? discusses some of the potential technical details underlying this sort of thoroughgoing
AGI self-modification.

Chapter 12
The Engineering and Development of Ethics
Co-authored with Stephan Vladimir Bugaj and Joel Pitt
12.1 Introduction
Most commonly, if a work on advanced AI mentions ethics at all, it occurs in a final summary
chapter, discussing in broad terms some of the possible implications of the technical ideas presented
beforehand. It’s no coincidence that the order is reversed here: in the case of CogPrime,
AGI-ethics considerations played a major role in the design process ... and thus the chapter on
ethics occurs near the beginning rather than the end. In the CogPrime approach, ethics is not
a particularly distinct topic, being richly interwoven with cognition and education and other
aspects of the AGI project.
The ethics of advanced AGI is a complex issue with multiple aspects. Among the many issues
there are:
1. Risks posed by the possibility of human beings using AGI systems for evil ends
2. Risks posed by AGI systems created without well-defined ethical systems
3. Risks posed by AGI systems with initially well-defined and sensible ethical systems eventually
going rogue – an especially big risk if these systems are more generally intelligent than
humans, and possess the capability to modify their own source code
4. the ethics of experimenting on AGI systems when one doesn’t understand the nature of
their experience
5. AGI rights: in what circumstances does using an AGI as a tool or servant constitute “slavery”
In this chapter we will focus mainly (though not exclusively) on the question of how to create
an AGI with a rational and beneficial ethical system. After a somewhat wide-ranging discussion,
we will conclude with eight general points that we believe should be followed in working toward
"Friendly AGI" – most of which have to do, not with the internal design of the AGI, but with
the way the AGI is taught and interfaced with the real world.
While most of the particulars discussed in this book have nothing to do with ethics, it’s
important for the reader to understand that AGI-ethics considerations have played a major
role in many of our design decisions, underlying much of the technical contents of the book. As
the materials in this chapter should make clear, ethicalness is probably not something that one
can meaningfully tack onto an AGI system at the end, after developing the rest – it is likely
infeasible to architect an intelligent agent and then add on an “ethics module.” Rather, ethics
is something that has to do with all the different memory systems and cognitive processes that
205
206 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
constitute an intelligent system – and it’s something that involves both cognitive architecture
and the exploration a system does and the instruction it receives. It’s a very complex matter
that is richly intermixed with all the other aspects of intelligence, and here we will treat it as
such.
12.2 Review of Current Thinking on the Risks of AGI
Before proceeding to outline our own perspective on AGI ethics in the context of CogPrime, we
will review the main existing strains of thought on the potential ethical dangers associated with
AGI. One science fiction film after another has highlighted these dangers, lodging the issue deep
in our cultural awareness; unsurprisingly, much less attention has been paid to serious analysis
of the risks in their various dimensions, but there is still a non-trivial literature worth paying
attention to.
Hypothetically, an AGI with superhuman intelligence and capability could dispense with
humanity altogether – i.e. posing an "existential risk" [Bos02]. In the worst case, an evil but
brilliant AGI, perhaps programmed by a human sadist, could consign humanity to unimaginable
tortures (i.e. realizing a modern version of the medieval Christian visions of hell). On the
other hand, the potential benefits of powerful AGI also go literally beyond human imagination.
It seems quite plausible that an AGI with massively superhuman intelligence and positive
disposition toward humanity could provide us with truly dramatic benefits, such as a virtual
end to material scarcity, disease and aging. Advanced AGI could also help individual humans
grow in a variety of directions, including directions leading beyond "legacy humanity," according
to their own taste and choice.
Eliezer Yudkowsky has introduced the term "Friendly AI", to refer to advanced AGI systems
that act with human benefit in mind [Yud06]. Exactly what this means has not been specified
precisely, though informal interpretations abound. Goertzel [Goe06b] has sought to clarify the
notion in terms of three core values of Joy, Growth and Freedom. In this view, a Friendly AI
would be one that advocates individual and collective human joy and growth, while respecting
the autonomy of human choices.
Some (for example, Hugo de Garis, [DG05]), have argued that Friendly AI is essentially
an impossibility, in the sense that the odds of a dramatically superhumanly intelligent mind
worrying about human benefit are vanishingly small. If this is the case, then the best options
for the human race would presumably be to either avoid advanced AGI development altogether,
or to else fuse with AGI before it gets too strongly superhuman, so that beings-originated-ashumans
can enjoy the benefits of greater intelligence and capability (albeit at cost of sacrificing
their humanity).
Others (e.g. Mark Waser [Was09]) have argued that Friendly AI is essentially inevitable,
because greater intelligence correlates with greater morality. Evidence from evolutionary and
human history is adduced in favor of this point, along with more abstract arguments.
Yudkowsky [Yud06] has discussed the possibility of creating AGI architectures that are in
some sense "provably Friendly" – either mathematically, or else at least via very tight lines of rational
verbal argumentation. However, several issues have been raised with this approach. First,
it seems likely that proving mathematical results of this nature would first require dramatic advances
in multiple branches of mathematics. Second, such a proof would require a formalization
of the goal of "Friendliness," which is a subtler matter than it might seem [Leg06b, Leg06a].
12.2 Review of Current Thinking on the Risks of AGI 207
Formalization of human morality has vexed moral philosophers for quite some time. Finally, it is
unclear the extent to which such a proof could be created in a generic, environment-independent
way – but if the proof depends on properties of the physical environment, then it would require
a formalization of the environment itself, which runs up against various problems such
as the complexity of the physical world and also the fact that we currently have no complete,
consistent theory of physics. Kaj Sotala has provided a list of 14 objections to the Friendly
AI concept, and suggested answers to each of them [Sot11]. Stephen Omohundro [Omo08] has
argued that any advanced AI system will very likely demonstrate certain "basic AI drives", such
as desiring to be rational, to self-protect, to acquire resources, and to preserve and protect its
utility function and avoid counterfeit utility; these drives, he suggests, must be taken carefully
into account in formulating approaches to Friendly AI.
The problem of formally or at least very carefully defining the goal of Friendliness has been
considered from a variety of perspectives, none showing dramatic success. Yudkowsky [Yud04]
has suggested the concept of "Coherent Extrapolated Volition", which roughly refers to the
extrapolation of the common values of the human race. Many subtleties arise in specifying
this concept – e.g. if Bob Jones is often possessed by a strong desire to kill all Martians, but
he deeply aspires to be a nonviolent person, then the CEV approach would not rate "killing
Martians" as part of Bob’s contribution to the CEV of humanity.
Goertzel [Goe10a] has proposed a related notion of Coherent Aggregated Volition (CAV),
which eschews the subtleties of extrapolation, and simply seeks a reasonably compact, coherent,
consistent set of values that is fairly close to the collective value-set of humanity. In the CAV
approach, "killing Martians" would be removed from humanity’s collective value-set because
it’s uncommon and not part of the most compact/coherent/consistent overall model of human
values, rather than because of Bob Jones’ aspiration to nonviolence.
One thought we have recently entertained is that the core concept underlying CAV might
be better thought of as CBV or "Coherent Blended Volition." CAV seems to be easily misinterpreted
as meaning the average of different views, which was not the original intention. The
CBV terminology clarifies that the CBV of a diverse group of people should not be thought of
as an average of their perspectives, but as something more analogous to a "conceptual blend"
[FT02] – incorporating the most essential elements of their divergent views into a whole that is
overall compact, elegant and harmonious. The subtlety here (to which we shall return below)
is that for a CBV blend to be broadly acceptable, the different parties whose views are being
blended must agree to some extent that enough of the essential elements of their own views
have been included. The process of arriving at this sort of consensus may involve extrapolation
of a roughly similar sort to that considered in CEV.
Multiple attempts at axiomatization of human values have also been attempted, e.g. with a
view toward providing near-term guidance to military robots (see e.g. Arkin’s excellent though
chillingly-titled book Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots [Ark09b], the result
of US military funded research). However, there are reasonably strong arguments that human
values (similarly to e.g. human language or human perceptual classification rules) are too complex
and multifaceted to be captured in any compact set of formal logic rules. Wallach [WA10]
has made this point eloquently, and argued the necessity of fusing top-down (e.g. formal logic
based) and bottom-up (e.g. self-organizing learning based) approaches to machine ethics.
A number of more sociological considerations also arise. It is sometimes argued that the risk
from highly-advanced AGI going morally awry on its own may be less than that of moderatelyadvanced
AGI being used by human beings to advocate immoral ends. This possibility gives
208 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
rise to questions about the ethical value of various practical modalities of AGI development,
for instance:
• Should AGI be developed in a top-secret installation by a select group of individuals selected
for a combination of technical and scientific brilliance and moral uprightness, or other
qualities deemed relevant (a "closed approach")? Or should it be developed out in the
open, in the manner of open-source software projects like Linux? (an "open approach").
The open approach allows the collective intelligence of the world to more fully participate
– but also potentially allows the more unsavory elements of the human race to take some
of the publicly-developed AGI concepts and tools private, and develop them into AGIs
with selfish or evil purposes in mind. Is there some meaningful intermediary between these
extremes?
• Should governments regulate AGI, with Friendliness in mind (as advocated carefully by e.g
Bill Hibbard [Hib02])? Or will this just cause AGI development to move to the handful of
countries with more liberal policies? ... or cause it to move underground, where nobody can
see the dangers developing? As a rough analogue, it’s worth noting that the US government’s
imposition of restrictions on stem cell research, under President George W. Bush, appears
to have directly stimulated the provision of additional funding for stem cell research in other
nations like Korea, Singapore and China.
The former issue is, obviously, highly relevant to CogPrime (which is currently being developed
via the open source CogPrime project); and so the various dimensions of this issues are
worth briefly sketching here.
We have a strong skepticism of self-appointed elite groups that claim (even if they genuinely
believe) that they know what’s best for everyone, and a healthy respect for the power of collective
intelligence and the Global Brain, which the open approach is ideal for tapping. On the other
hand, we also understand the risk of terrorist groups or other malevolent agents forking an open
source AGI project and creating something terribly dangerous and destructive. Balancing these
factors against each other rigorously, seems beyond the scope of current human science.
Nobody really understands the social dynamics by which open technological knowledge plays
out in our current world, let alone hypothetical future scenarios. Right now there exists open
knowledge about many very dangerous technologies, and there exist many terrorist groups, yet
these groups fortunately make scant use of these technologies. The reasons why appear to be
essentially sociological – the people involved in these terrorist groups tend not to be the ones
who have mastered the skills of turning public knowledge on cutting-edge technologies into real
engineered systems. But while it’s easy to observe this sociological phenomenon, we certainly
have no way to estimate its quantitative extent from first principles. We don’t really have a
strong understanding of how safe we are right now, given the technology knowledge available
right now via the Internet, textbooks, and so forth. Even relatively straightforward issues such
as nuclear proliferation remain confusing, even to the experts.
It’s also quite clear that keeping powerful AGI locked up by an elite group doesn’t really
provide reliable protection against malevolent human agents. History is rife with such situations
going awry, e.g. by the leadership of the group being subverted, or via brute force inflicted by
some outside party, or via a member of the elite group defecting to some outside group in the
interest of personal power or reward or due to group-internal disagreements, etc. There are
many things that can go wrong in such situations, and the confidence of any particular group
that they are immune to such issues, cannot be taken very seriously. Clearly, neither the open
nor closed approach qualifies as a panacea.
12.3 The Value of an Explicit Goal System 209
12.3 The Value of an Explicit Goal System
One of the subtle issues confronted in the quest to design ethical AGIs is how closely one
wants to emulate human ethical judgment and behavior. Here one confronts the brute fact
that, even according to their own deeply-held standards, humans are not all that ethical. One
high-level conclusion we came to very early in the process of designing CogPrime is that, just as
humans are not the most intelligent minds achievable, they are also not the most ethical minds
achievable. Even if one takes human ethics, broadly conceived, as the standard – there are
almost surely possible AGI systems that are much more ethical according to human standards
than nearly all human beings. This is not mainly because of ethics-specific features of the
human mind, but rather because of the nature of the human motivational system, which leads
to many complexities that drive humans to behaviors that are unethical according to their own
standards. So, one of the design decisions we made for CogPrime – with ethics as well as other
reasons in mind – was not to closely imitate the human motivational system, but rather to craft
a novel motivational system combining certain aspects of the human motivational system with
other profoundly non-human aspects.
On the other hand, the design of ethical AGI systems still has a lot to gain from the study
of human ethical cognition and behavior. Human ethics has many aspects, which we associate
here with the different types of memory, and it’s important that AGI systems can encompass
all of them. Also, as we will note below, human ethics develops in childhood through a series
of natural stages, parallel to and entwined with the cognitive developmental stages reviewed in
Chapter 11 above. We will argue that for an AGI with a virtual or robotic body, it makes sense
to think of ethical development as proceeding through similar stages. In a CogPrime context,
the particulars of these stages can then be understood in terms of the particulars of CogPrime’s
cognitive processes – which brings AGI ethics from the domain of theoretical abstraction into
the realm of practical algorithm design and education.
But even if the human stages of ethical development make sense for non-human AGIs, this
doesn’t mean the particulars of the human motivational system need to be replicated in these
AGIs, regarding ethics or other matters. A key point here is that, in the context of human
intelligence, the concept of a "goal" is a descriptive abstraction. But in the AGI context, it
seems quite valuable to introduce goals as explicit design elements (which is what is done in
CogPrime ) – both for ethical reasons and for broader AGI design reasons.
Humans may adopt goals for a time and then drop them, may pursue multiple conflicting
goals simultaneously, and may often proceed in an apparently goal-less manner. Sometimes the
goal that a person appears to be pursuing, may be very different than the one they think they’re
pursuing. Evolutionary psychology [BDL93] argues that, directly or indirectly, all humans are
ultimately pursuing the goal of maximizing the inclusive fitness of their genes – but given the
complex mix of evolution and self-organization in natural history [Sal93], this is hardly a general
explanation for human behavior. Ultimately, in the human context, "goal" is best thought of
as a frequently useful heuristic concept.
AGI systems, however, need not emulate human cognition in every aspect, and may be
architected with explicit "goal systems." This provides no guarantee that said AGI systems will
actually pursue the goals that their goal systems specify – depending on the role that the goal
system plays in the overall system dynamics, sometimes other dynamical phenomena might
intervene and cause the system to behave in ways opposed to its explicit goals. However, we
submit that this design sketch provides a better framework than would exist in an AGI system
closely emulating the human brain.
210 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
We realize this point may be somewhat contentious – a counter-argument would be that
the human brain is known to support at least moderately ethical behavior, according to human
ethical standards, whereas less brain-like AGI systems are much less well understood. However,
the obvious counter-counterpoints are that:
• Humans are not all that consistently ethical, so that creating AGI systems potentially much
more practically powerful than humans, but with closely humanlike ethical, motivational
and goal systems, could in fact be quite dangerous
• The effect on a human-like ethical/motivational/goal system of increasing the intelligence,
or changing the physical embodiment or cognitive capabilities, of the agent containing the
system, is unknown and difficult to predict given all the complexities involved
The course we tentatively recommend, and are following in our own work, is to develop AGI
systems with explicit, hierarchically-dominated goal systems. That is:
• create one or more "top goals" (we call them Ubergoals in CogPrime )
• have the system derive subgoals from these, using its own intelligence, potentially guided
by educational interaction or explicit programming
• have a significant percentage of the system’s activity governed by the explicit pursuit of
these goals
Note that the "significant percentage" need not be 100%; CogPrime, for example, combines
explicitly goal-directed activity with other "spontaneous" activity. Requiring that all activity
be explicitly goal-directed may be too strict a requirement to place on AGI architectures.
The next step, of course, is for the top-level goals to be chosen in accordance with the
principle of human-Friendliness. The next one of our eight points, about the Global Brain,
addresses one way of doing this. In our near-term work with CogPrime, we are using simplistic
approaches, with a view toward early-stage system testing.
12.4 Ethical Synergy
An explicit goal system provides an explicit way to ensure that ethical principles (as represented
in system goals) play a significant role in guiding an AGI system’s behavior. However, in an
integrative design like CogPrime the goal system is only a small part of the overall story,
and it’s important to also understand how ethics relates to the other aspects of the cognitive
architecture.
One of the more novel ideas presented in this chapter is that different types of ethical intuition
may be associated with different types of memory – and to possess mature ethics, a mind
must display ethical synergy between the ethical processes associated with its memory types.
Specifically, we suggest that:
• Episodic memory corresponds to the process of ethically assessing a situation based on
similar prior situations
• Sensorimotor memory corresponds to “mirror neuron” type ethics, where you feel another
person’s feelings via mirroring their physiological emotional responses and actions
• Declarative memory corresponds to rational ethical judgment
12.4 Ethical Synergy 211
• Procedural memory corresponds to “ethical habit” ... learning by imitation and reinforcement
to do what is right, even when the reasons aren’t well articulated or understood
• Attentional memory corresponds to the existence of appropriate patterns guiding one to
pay adequate attention to ethical considerations at appropriate times
• Intentional memory corresponds to the pervasion of ethics through one’s choices about
subgoaling (which leads into “when do the ends justify the means” ethical-balance questions)
One of our suggestions regarding AGI ethics is that an ethically mature person or AGI must
both master and balance all these kinds of ethics. We will focus especially here on declarative
ethics, which corresponds to Kohlberg’s theory of logical ethical judgment; and episodic ethics,
which corresponds to Gilligan’s theory of empathic ethical judgment. Ultimately though, all five
aspects are critically important; and a CogPrime system if appropriately situated and educated
should be able to master and integrate all of them.
12.4.1 Stages of Development of Declarative Ethics
Complementing generic theories of cognitive development such as Piaget’s and Perry’s, theorists
have also proposed specific stages of moral and ethical development. The two most relevant
theories in this domain are those of Kohlberg and Gilligan, which we will review here, both
individually and in terms of their integration and application in the AGI context.
Lawrence Kohlberg’s [KLH83, Koh81] moral development model, called the “ethics of justice”
by Gilligan, is based on a rational modality as the central vehicle for moral development. In our
perspective this is a firmly declarative form of ethics, based on explicit analysis and reasoning. It
is based on an impartial regard for persons, proposing that ethical consideration must be given
to all individual intelligences without a priori judgment (prejudice). Consideration is given for
individual merit and preferences, and the goals of an ethical decision are equal treatment (in
the general, not necessarily the particular) and reciprocity. Echoing Kant’s [Kan64] categorical
imperative, the decisions considered most successful in this model are those which exhibit
“reversibility”, where a moral act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether
or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within the
situation. In other words, a situational, contextualized “do unto others as you would have them
do unto you” criterion. The ethics of justice can be viewed as three stages (each of which has
six substages, on which we will not elaborate here), depicted in Table 12.1.
In Kohlberg’s perspective, cognitive development level contributes to moral development, as
moral understanding emerges from increased cognitive capability in the area of ethical decision
making in a social context. Relatedly, Kohlberg also looks at stages of social perspective and
their consequent interpersonal outlook. As shown in Table 12.1, these are correlated to the
stages of moral development, but also map onto Piagetian models of cognitive development (as
pointed out e.g. by Gibbs [Gib78], who presents a modification/interpretation of Kohlberg’s
ideas intended to align them more closely with Piaget’s). Interpersonal outlook can be understood
as rational understanding of the psychology of other persons (a theory of mind, with or
without empathy). Stage One, emergent from the infantile congitive stage, is entirely selfish
as only self awareness has developed. As cognitive sophistication about ethical considerations
increases, so do the moral and social perspective stages. Concrete and formal cognition bring
about the first instrumental egoism, and then social relations and systems perspectives, and

12.4.1.1 Uncertain Inference and the Ethics of Justice
Taking our cue from the analysis given in Chapter 11 of Piagetan stages in uncertain inference
based AGI systems (such as CogPrime ), we may explore the manifestation of Kohlberg’s
stages in AGI systems of this nature. Uncertain inference seems generally well-suited as a
declarative-ethics learning system, due to the nuanced ethical environment of real world situations.
Probabilistic knowledge networks can model belief networks, imitative reinforcement
learning based ethical pedagogy, and even simplistic moral maxims. In principle, they have the
flexibility to deal with complex ethical decisions, including not only weighted “for the greater
12.4 Ethical Synergy 213
good” dichotomous decision making, but also the ability to develop moral decision networks
which do not require that all situations be solved through resolution of a dichotomy.
When more than one person is being affected by an ethical decision, making a decision based
on reducing two choices to a single decision can often lead to decisions of dubious ethics. However,
a sufficiently complex uncertain inference network can represent alternate choices in which
multiple actions are taken that have equal (or near equal) belief weight but have very different
particulars – but because the decisions are applied in different contexts (to different groups of
individuals) they are morally equivalent. Though each individual action appears equally believable,
were any single decision applied to the entire population one or more individual may
be harmed, and the morally superior choice is to make case-dependent decisions. Equal moral
treatment is a general principle, and too often the mistake is made by thinking that to achieve
this general principle the particulars must be equal. This is not the case. Different treatment of
different individuals can result in morally equivalent treatment of all involved individuals, and
may be vastly morally superior to treating all the individuals with equal particulars. Simply
taking the largest population and deciding one course of action based on the result that is most
appealing to that largest group is not generally the most moral action.
Uncertain inference, especially a complex network with high levels of resource access as may
be found in a sophisticated AGI, is well suited for complex decision making resulting in a
multitude of actions, and of analyzing the options to find the set of actions that are ethically
optimal particulars for each decision context. Reflexive cognition and post-commitment moral
understanding may be the goal stages of an AGI system, or any intelligence, but the other
stages will be passed through on the way to that goal, and realistically some minds will never
reach higher order cognition or morality with regards to any context, and others will not be
able to function at this high order in every context (all currently known minds fail to function
at the highest order cognitively or morally in some contexts).
Infantile and concrete cognition are the underpinnings of the egoist and socialized stages,
with formal aspects also playing a role in a more complete understanding of social models
when thinking using the social modalities. Cognitively infantile patterns can produce no more
than blind egoism as without a theory of mind, there is no capability to consider the other.
Since most intelligences acquire concrete modality and therefore some nascent social perspective
relatively quickly, most egoists are instrumental egoists. The social relationship and systems
perspectives include formal aspects which are achieved by systematic social experimentation,
and therefore experiential reinforcement learning of correct and incorrect social modalities.
Initially this is a one-on-one approach (relationship stage), but as more knowledge of social
action and consequences is acquired, a formal thinker can understand not just consequentiality
but also intentionality in social action.
Extrapolation from models of individual interaction to general social theoretic notions is also
a formal action. Rational, logical positivist approaches to social and political ideas, however, are
the norm of formal thinking. Contractual and committed moral ethics emerges from a higherorder
formalization of the social relationships and systems patterns of thinking. Generalizations
of social observation become, through formal analysis, systems of social and political doctrine.
Highly committed, but grounded and logically supportable, belief is the hallmark of formal
cognition as expressed contractual moral stage. Though formalism is at work in the socialized
moral stages, its fullest expression is in committed contractualism.
Finally, reflexive cognition is especially important in truly reaching the post-commitment
moral stage in which nuance and complexity are accommodated. Because reflexive cognition
is necessary to change one’s mind not just about particular rational ideas, but whole ways of
214 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
thinking, this is a cognitive precedent to being able to reconsider an entire belief system, one
that has had contractual logic built atop reflexive adherence that began in early development.
If the initial moral system is viewed as positive and stable, then this cognitive capacity is
seen as dangerous and scary, but if early morality is stunted or warped, then this ability is
seen as enlightened. However, achieving this cognitive stage does not mean one automatically
changes their belief systems, but rather that the mental machinery is in place to consider
the possibilities. Because many people do not reach this level of cognitive development in the
area of moral and ethical thinking, it is associated with negative traits (“moral relativism”
and “flip-flopping”). However, this cognitive flexibility generally leads to more sophisticated and
applicable moral codes, which in turn leads to morality which is actually more stable because
it is built upon extensive and deep consideration rather than simple adherence to reflexive or
rationalized ideologies.
12.4.2 Stages of Development of Empathic Ethics
Complementing Kohlberg’s logic-and-justice-focused approach, Carol Gilligan’s [Gil82] “ethics
of care” model is a moral development theory which posits that empathetic understanding
plays the central role in moral progression from an initial self-centered modality to a socially
responsible one. The ethics of care model is concerned with the ways in which an individual
cares (responds to dilemmas using empathetic responses) about self and others. As shown in
Table 12.3, the ethics of care is broken into the same three primary stage as Kohlberg, but with
a focus on empathetic, emotional caring rather than rationalized, logical principles of justice.
Stage
Pre-Conventional
Conventional
Post-Conventional
Principle of Care
Individual Survival
Self Sacrifice for the Greater Good
Principle of Nonviolence (do not hurt others, or oneself)
Table 12.3: Gilligan’s Stages of the Ethics of Care
For an “ethics of care” approach to be applied in an AGI, the AGI must be capable of internal
simulation of other minds it encounters, in a similar manner to how humans regularly simulate
one another internally. Without any mechanism for internal simulation, it is unlikely that an
AGI can develop any sort of empathy toward other minds, as opposed to merely logically
or probabilistically modeling other agents’ behavior or other minds’ internal contents. In a
CogPrime context, this ties in closely with how CogPrime handles episodic knowledge – partly
via use of an internal simulation world, which is able to play “mental movies” of prior and
hypothesized scenarios within the AGI system’s mind.
However, in humans empathy involves more than just simulation, it also involves sensorimotor
responses, and of course emotional responses – a topic we will discuss in more depth in Appendix
?? where we review the functionality of mirror neurons and mirror systems in the human brains.
When we see or hear someone suffering, this sensory input causes motor responses in us similar
to if we were suffering ourselves, which initiates emotional empathy and corresponding cognitive
processes.
12.4 Ethical Synergy 215
Thus, empathic “ethics of care” involves a combination of episodic and sensorimotor ethics,
complementing the mainly declarative ethics associated with the “ethics of justice.”
In Gilligan’s perspective, the earliest stage of ethical development occurs before empathy
becomes a consistent and powerful force. Next, the hallmark of the conventional stage is that
at this point, the individual is so overwhelmed with their empathic response to others that
they neglect themselves in order to avoid hurting others. Note that this stage doesn’t occur
in Kohlberg’s hierarchy at all. Kohlberg and Gilligan both begin with selfish unethicality, but
their following stages diverge. A person could in principle manifest Gilligan’s conventional stage
without having a refined sense of justice (thus not entering Kohlberg’s conventional stage); or
they could manifest Kohlberg’s conventional stage without partaking in an excessive degree of
self-sacrifice (thus not entering Gilligan’s conventional stage). We will suggest below that in fact
the empathic and logical aspects of ethics are more unified in real human development than
these separate theories would suggest. However, even if this is so, the possibility is still there
that in some AGI systems the levels of declarative and empathic ethics could wildly diverge.
It is interesting to note that Gilligan’s and Kohlberg’s final stages converge more closely
than their intermediate ones. Kohlberg’s post-conventional stage focuses on universal rights,
and Gilligan’s on universal compassion. Still, the foci here are quite different; and, as will be
elaborated below, we believe that both Kohlberg’s and Gilligan’s theories constitute very partial
views of the actual end-state of ethical advancement.
12.4.3 An Integrative Approach to Ethical Development
We feel that both Kohlberg’s and Gilligan’s theories contain elements of the whole picture of
ethical development, and that both approaches are necessary to create a moral, ethical artificial
general intelligence – just as, we suggest, both internal simulation and uncertain inference are
necessary to create a sufficiently intelligent and volitional intelligence in the first place. Also,
we contend, the lack of direct analysis of the underlying psychology of the stages is a deficiency
shared by both the Kohlberg and Gilligan models as they are generally discussed. A successful
model of integrative ethics necessarily contains elements of both the care and justice models, as
well as reference to the underlying developmental psychology and its influence on the character
of the ethical stage. Furthermore, intentional and attentional ethics need to be brought into
the picture, complementing Kohlberg’s focus on declarative knowledge and Gilligan’s focus on
episodic and sensorimotor knowledge.
With these notions in mind, we propose the following integrative theory of the stages of
ethical development, shown in Tables 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6. In our integrative model, the justicebased
and empathic aspects of ethical judgment are proposed to develop together. Of course, in
any one individual, one or another aspect may be dominant. Even so, however, the combination
of the two is equally important as either of the two individual ingredients.
For instance, we suggest that in any psychologically healthy human, the conventional stage
of ethics (typifying childhood, and in many cases adulthood as well) involves a combination
of Gilligan-esqe empathic ethics and Kohlberg-esque ethical reasoning. This combination is
supported by Piagetan concrete operational cognition, which allows moderately sophisticated
linguistic interaction, theory of mind, and symbolic modeling of the world.
And, similarly, we propose that in any truly ethically mature human, empathy and rational
justice are both fully developed. Indeed the two interpenetrate each other deeply.
216 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
Once one goes beyond simplistic, childlike notions of fairness (“an eye for an eye” and so
forth), applying rational justice in a purely intellectual sense is just as difficult as any other
real-world logical inference problem. Ethical quandaries and quagmires are easily encountered,
and are frequently cut through by a judicious application of empathic simulation.
On the other hand, empathy is a far more powerful force when used in conjunction with
reason: analogical reasoning lets us empathize with situations we have never experienced. For
instance, a person who has never been clinically depressed may have a hard time empathizing
with individuals who are; but using the power of reason, they can imagine their worst state of
depression magnified by several times and then extended over a long period of time, and then
reason about what this might be like ... and empathize based on their inferential conclusion.
Reason is not antithetical to empathy but rather is the key to making empathy more broadly
impactful.
Finally, the enlightened stage of ethical development involves both a deeper compassion and
a more deeply penetrating rationality and objectiveness. Empathy with all sentient beings is
manageable in everyday life only once one has deeply reflected on one’s own self and largely
freed oneself of the confusions and illusions that characterize much of the ordinary human’s
inner existence. It is noteworthy, for example, that Buddhism contains both a richly developed
ethics of universal compassion, and also an intricate logical theory of the inner workings of
cognition [Stc00], detailing in exquisite rational detail the manner in which minds originate
structures and dynamics allowing them to comprehend themselves and the world.
12.4.4 Integrative Ethics and Integrative AGI
What does our integrative approach to ethical development have to say about the ethical
development of AGI systems? The lessons are relatively straighforward, if one considers an AGI
system that, like CogPrime, explicitly contains components dedicated to logical inference and
to simulation. Application of the above ethical ideas to other sorts of AGI systems is also quite
possible, but would require a lengthier treatment and so won’t be addressed here.
In the context of a CogPrime-type AGI system, Kolhberg’s stages correspond to increasingly
sophisticated application of logical inference to matters of rights and fairness. It is not clear
whether humans contain an innate sense of fairness. In the context of AGIs, it would be possible
to explicitly wire a sense of fairness into an AGI system, but in the context of a rich environment
and active human teachers, this actually appears quite unnecessary. Experiential instruction in
the notions of rights and fairness should suffice to teach an inference-based AGI system how to
manipulate these concepts, analogously to teaching the same AGI system how to manipulate
number, mass and other such quantities. Ascending the Kohlberg stages is then mainly a matter
of acquiring the ability to carry out suitably complex inferences in the domain of rights and
fairness. The hard part here is inference control – choosing which inference steps to take – and
in a sophisticated AGI inference engine, inference control will be guided by experience, so that
the more ethical judgments the system has executed and witnessed, the better it will become at
making new ones. And, as argued above, simulative activity can be extremely valuable for aiding
with inference control. When a logical inference process reaches a point of acute uncertainty
(the backward or forward chaining inference tree can’t decide which expansion step to take), it
can run a simulation to cut through the confusion – i.e., it can use empathy to decide which

logical inference step to take in thinking about applying the notions of rights and fairness to a
given situation.
Gilligan’s stages correspond to increasingly sophisticated control of empathic simulation –
which in a CogPrime-type AGI system, is carried out by a specific system component devoted
to running internal simulations of aspects of the outside world, which includes a subcomponent
specifically tuned for simulating sentient actors. The conventional stage has to do with the raw,
uncontrolled capability for such simulation; and the post-conventional stage corresponds to its
contextual, goal-oriented control. But controlling empathy, clearly, requires subtle management
of various uncertain contextual factors, which is exactly what uncertain logical inference is
good at – so, in an AGI system combining an uncertain inference component with a simulative
component, it is the inference component that would enable the nuanced control of empathy
allowing the ascent to Gilligan’s post-conventional stage.
In our integrative perspective, in the context of an AGI system integrating inference and
simulation components, we suggest that the ascent from the pre-ethical to the conventional
stage may be carried out largely via independent activity of these two components. Empathy
is needed, and reasoning about fairness and rights are needed, but the two need not intimately
and sensitively intersect – though they must of course intersect to some extent.

manner.
Table 12.5: Integrative Model of the Stages of Ethical Development, Part 2
The main engine of advancement from the conventional to mature stage, we suggest, is robust
and subtle integration of the simulative and inferential components. To expand empathy beyond
the most obvious cases, analogical inference is needed; and to carry out complex inferences about
justice, empathy-guided inference-control is needed.
Finally, to advance from the mature to the enlightened stage, what is required is a very
advanced capability for unified reflexive inference and simulation. The system must be able
to understand itself deeply, via modeling itself both simulatively and inferentially – which
will generally be achieved via a combination of being good at modeling, and becoming less
convoluted and more coherent, hence making self-modeling easier.
Of course, none of this tells you in detail how to create an AGI system with advanced
ethical capabilities. What it does tell you, however, is one possible path that may be followed to
achieve this end goal. If one creates an integrative AGI system with appropriately interconnected
inferential and simulative components, and treats it compassionately and fairly, and provides
it extensive, experientially grounded ethical instruction in a rich social environment, then the
AGI system should be able to ascend the ethical hierarchy and achieve a high level of ethical
sophistication. In fact it should be able to do so more reliably than human beings because of
the capability we have to identify its errors via inspecting its internal knowedge-stage, which

will enable us to tailor its environment and instructions more suitably than can be done in the
human case.
If an absolute guarantee of the ethical soundness of an AGI is what one is after, the line of
thinking proposed here is not at all useful. Experiential education is by its nature an uncertain
thing. One can strive to minimize the uncertainty, but it will still exist. Inspection of the
internals of an AGI’s mind is not a total solution to uncertainty minimization, because any
AGI capable of powerful general intelligence is going to have a complex internal state that
no external observer will be able to fully grasp, no matter how transparent the knowledge
representation.
However, if what one is after is a plausible, pragmatic path to architecting and educating
ethical AGI systems, we believe the ideas presented here constitute a sensible starting-point.
Certainly there is a great deal more to be learned and understood – the science and practice
of AGI ethics, like AGI itself, are at a formative stage at present. What is key, in our view, is
that as AGI technology develops, AGI ethics develops alongside and within it, in a thoroughly
coupled way.
12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in
to a Multifactorial Ethical Model
One of the issues with the "ethics of justice" as reviewed above, which makes it inadequate
to serve as the sole basis of an AGI ethical system (though it may certainly play a significant
220 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
role), is the lack of any clear formulation of what "justice" means. This section explores this
issue, via detailed consideration of the “Golden Rule” folk maxim do unto others as you
would have them do unto you – a classical formulation of the notion of fairness and justics
– to AGI ethics. Taking the Golden Rule as a starting-point, we will elaborate five ethical
imperatives that incorporate aspects of the notion of ethical synergy discussed above. Simple as
it may seem, the Golden Rule actually elicits a variety of deep issues regarding the relationship
between ethics, experience and learning. When seriously analyzed, it results in a multifactorial
elaboration, involving the combination of various factors related to the basic Golden Rule idea.
Which brings us back in the end to the potential value of methods like CEV, CAV or CBV for
understanding how human ethics balances the multiple factors. Our goal here is not to present
any kind of definitive analysis of the ethics of justice, but just to briefly and roughly indicate
a number of the relevant significant issues – things that anyone designing or teaching an AGI
would do well to keep in mind.
The trickiest aspect of the Golden Rule, as has been frequently observed, is achieving the
right level of abstraction. Taken too literally, the Golden Rule would suggest, for instance, that
a parent should not wipe a child’s soiled bottom because the parent does not want the child to
wipe the parent’s soiled bottom. But if the parent interprets the Golden Rule more intelligently
and abstractly, the parent may conclude that they should wipe the child’s bottom after all:
they should “wipe the child’s bottom when the child can’t do it themselves”, consistently with
believing that the child should “wipe the parent’s bottom when the parent can’t do it themselves”
(which may well happen eventually should the parent develop incontinence in old age).
This line of thinking leads to Kant’s Categorical Imperative [Kan64] which (in one interpretation)
states essentially that one should “Act only according to that maxim whereby you
can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." The Categorical Imperative
adds precision to the Golden Rule, but also removes the practicality of the latter. Formalizing
the “implicit universal law” underlying an everyday action is a huge problem, falling prey
to the same issue that has kept us from adequately formalizing the rules of natural language
grammar, or formalizing common-sense knowledge about everyday object like cups, bowls and
grass (substantial effort notwithstanding, e.g. Cyc in the commonsense knowledge case, and the
whole discipline of modern linguistics in the NL case). There is no way to apply the Categorical
Imperative, as literally stated, in everyday life.
Furthermore, if one wishes to teach ethics as well as to practice it, the Categorical Imperative
actually has a significant disadvantage compared to some other possible formulations of
the Golden Rule. The problem is that, if one follows the Categorical Imperative, one’s fellow
members of society may well never understand the principles under which one is acting. Each
of us may internally formulate abstract principles in a different way, and these may be very
difficult to communicate, especially among individuals with different belief systems, different
cognitive architectures, or different levels of intelligence. Thus, if one’s goal is not just to act
ethically, but to encourage others to act ethically by setting a good example, the Categorical
Imperative may not be useful at all, as others may be unable to solve the “inverse problem” of
guessing your intended maxim from your observed behavior.
On the other hand, one wouldn’t want to universally restrict one’s behavioral maxims to
those that one’s fellow members of society can understand – in that case, one would have to act
with a two-year old or a dog according to principles that they could understand, which would
clearly be unethical according to human common sense. (Every two-year-old, once they grow
up, would be grateful to their parents for not following this sort of principle.)
12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in to a Multifactorial Ethical Model 221
And the concept of “setting a good example” ties in with an important concept from learning
theory: imitative learning. Humans appear to be hard-wired for imitative learning, in part via
mirror neuron systems in the brain; and, it seems clear that at least in the early stages of AGI
development, imitative learning is going to play a key role. Copying what other agents do is an
extremely powerful heuristic, and while AGIs may eventually grow beyond this, much of their
early ethical education is likely to arise during a phase when they have not done so. A strength
of the classic Golden Rule is that one is acting according to behaviors that one wants one’s
observers to imitate – which makes sense in that many of these observers will be using imitative
learning as a significant part of their learning toolkit.
The truth of the matter, it seems, is (as often happens) not all that simple or elegant. Ethical
behavior seems to be most pragmatically viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where among the multiple objectives are three that we have just discussed, and two others that
emerge from learning theory and will be discussed shortly:
1. The imitability (i.e. the Golden Rule fairly narrowly and directly construed): the goal of
acting in a way so that having others directly imitate one’s actions, in directly comparable
contexts, is desirable to oneself
2. The comprehensibility: the goal of acting in a way so that others can understand the
principles underlying one’s actions
3. Experiential groundedness. An intelligent agent should not be expected to act according
to an ethical principle unless there are many examples of the principle-in-action in its own
direct or observational experience
4. The categorical imperative: Act according to abstract principles that you would be
happy to see implemented as universal laws
5. Logical coherence. An ethical system should be roughly logically coherent, in the sense
that the different principles within it should mesh well with one another and perhaps even
naturally emerge from each other.
Just for convenience, without implying any finality or great profundity to the list, we will refer
to these as the "five imperatives."
The above are all ethical objectives to be valued and balanced, to different extents in different
contexts. The imitability imperative, obviously, loses importance in societies of agents that don’t
make heavy use of imitative learning. The comprehensibility imperative is more important
in agents that value social community-building generally, and less so in agent that are more
isolative and self-focused.
Note that the fifth point given above is logically of a different nature than the four previous
ones. The first four imperatives govern individual ethical principles; the fifth regards systems of
ethical principles, as they interact with each other. Logical coherence is of significant but varying
importance in human ethical systems. Huge effort has been spent by theologians of various
stripes in establishing and refining the logical coherence of the ethical systems associated with
their religions. However, it is arguably going to be even more important in the context of AGI
systems, especially if these AGI systems utilize cognitive methods based on logical inference,
probability theory or related methods.
Experiential groundedness is important because making pragmatic ethical judgments is
bound to require reference to an internal library of examples (“episodic ethics”) in which ethical
principles have previously been applied. This is required for analogical reasoning, and in
logic-based AGI systems, is also required for pruning of the logical inference trees involved in
determining ethical judgments.
222 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
To the extent that the Golden Rule is valued as an ethical imperative, experiential grounding
may be supplied via observing the behaviors of others. This in itself is a powerful argument in
favor of the Golden Rule: without it, the experiential library a system possesses is restricted to
its own experience, which is bound to be a very small library compared to what it can assemble
from observing the behaviors of others.
The overall upshot is that, ideally, an ethical intelligence should act according to a logically
coherent system of principles, which are exemplified in its own direct and
observational experience, which are comprehensible to others and set a good example
for others, and which would serve as adequate universal laws if somehow
thus implemented. But, since this set of criteria is essentially impossible to fulfill in practice,
real-world intelligent agents must balance these various criteria – often in complex and
contextually-dependent ways.
We suggest that ethically advanced humans, in their pragmatic ethical choices, tend to act in
such a way as to appropriately contextually balance the above factors (along with other criteria,
but we have tried to articulate the most key factors). This sort of multi-factorial approach is
not as crisp or elegant as unidimensional imperatives like the Golden Rule or the Categorical
Imperative, but is more realistic in light of the complexly interacting multiple determinants
guiding individual and group human behavior.
And this brings us back to CEV, CAV, CBV and other possible ways of mining ethical
supergoals from the community of existing human minds. Given that abstract theories of ethics,
when seriously pursued as we have done in this section, tend to devolve into complex balancing
acts involving multiple factors – one then falls back into asking how human ethical systems
habitually perform these balancing acts. Which is what CEV, CAV, CBV try to measure.
12.5.1 The Golden Rule and the Stages of Ethical Development
Next we explore more explicitly how these Golden Rule based imperatives align with the ethical
developmental stages we have outlined here. With this in mind, specific ethical qualities
corresponding to the five imperatives have been italicized in the above table of developmental
stages.
It seems that imperatives 1-3 are critical for the passage from the pre-ethical to the conventional
stages of ethics. A child learns ethics largely by copying others, and by being interacted
with according to simply comprehensible implementations of the Golden Rule. In general, when
interacting with children learning ethics, it is important to act according to principles they can
comprehend. And given the nature of the concrete stage of cognitive development, experiential
groundedness is a must.
As a hypothesis regarding the dynamics underlying the psychological development of conventional
ethics, what we propose is as follows: The emergence of concrete-stage cognitive
capabilities leads to the capability for fulfillment of ethical imperatives 1 and 2 – a comprehensible
and workable implementation of the Golden Rule, based on a combination of inferential
and simulative cognition (operating largely separately at this stage, as will be conjectured below).
The effective interoperation of ethical imperatives 1-3, enacted in an appropriate social
environment, then leads to the other characteristics of the conventional ethical stage. The first
three imperatives can thus be viewed as the seed from which springs the general nature of
conventional ethics.
12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in to a Multifactorial Ethical Model 223
On the other hand, logical coherence and the categorical imperative (imperatives 5 and 4)
are matters for the formal stage of cognitive development, which come along only with the
mature approach to ethics. These come from abstracting ethics beyond direct experience and
manipulating them abstractly and formally – a stage which has the potential for more deeply
and broadly ethical behavior, but also for more complicated ethical perversions (it is the mature
capability for formal ethical reasoning that is able to produce ungrounded abstractions such
as “I’m torturing you for your own good”). Developmentally, we suggest that once the capability
for formal reasoning matures, the categorical imperative and the quest for logical ethical
coherence naturally emerge, and the sophisticated combination of inferential and simulative
cognition embodied in an appropriate social context then result in the emergence of the various
characteristics typifying the mature ethical stage.
Finally, it seems that one key aspect of the passage from the mature to the enlightened stage
of ethics is the penetration of these two final imperatives more and more deeply into the judging
mind itself. The reflexive stage of cognitive development is in part about seeking a deep logical
coherence between the aspects of one’s own mind, and making reasoned modifications to one’s
mind so as to improve the level of coherence. And, much of the process of mental discipline and
purification that comes with the passage to enlightened ethics has to do with the application
of the categorical imperative to one’s own thoughts and feelings – i.e. making a true inner
systematic effort to think and feel only those things one judges are actually generally good
and right to be thinking and feeling. Applying these principles internally appears critical for
effectively applying them externally, for reasons that are doubtlessly bound up with the interpenetration
of internal and external reality within the thinking mind, and for the “distributed
cognition” phenomenon wherein individual mind is itself an approximative abstraction to the
reality in which each individual’s mind is pragmatically extended across their social group and
their environment [Hut95].
Obviously, these are complex issues and we’re not posing the exploratory discussion given
here as conclusive in any sense. But what seems generally clear from this line of thinking is
that the complex balance between the multiple factors involved in AGI ethics, shifts during a
system’s development. If you did CEV, CAV or CBV among five year old humans, ten year
old humans, or adult humans, you would get different results. Probably you’d also get different
results from senior citizens! The way the factors are balanced depends on the mind’s cognitive
and emotional stage of development.
12.5.2 The Need for Context-Sensitivity and Adaptiveness in
Deploying Ethical Principles
As well as depending on developmental stage, there is also an obvious and dramatic contextsensitivity
involved here – both in calculating the fulfillment of abstract ethical imperatives,
and in balancing various imperatives against each other. As an example, consider the simple
Asimovian maxim “I will not harm humans,” which may be seen to follow from the Golden Rule
for any agent that doesn’t itself want to be harmed, and that considers humans as valid agents
on the same ethical level as itself. A more serious attempt to formulate this as an ethical maxim
might look something like
224 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
“I will not harm humans, nor through inaction allow harm to befall them. In situations
wherein one or more humans is attempting to harm another individual or group, I shall endeavor
to prevent this harm through means which avoid further harm. If this is unavoidable, I shall
select the human party to back based on a reckoning of their intentions towards others, and
implement their defense through the optimal balance between harm minimization and efficacy.
My ultimate goal is to preserve as much as possible of humanity, even if an individual or
subgroup of humans must come to harm to do so.”
However, it’s obvious that even a more elaborated principle like this is potentially subject to
extensive abuse. Many of the genocides scarring human history have been committed with the
goal of preserving and bettering humanity writ large, at the expense of a group of “undesirables.”
Further refinement would be necessary in order to define when the greater good of humanity
may actually be served through harm to others. A first actor principle of aggression might
seem to solve this problem, but sometimes first actors in violent conflict are taking preemptive
measures against the stated goals of an enemy to destroy them. Such situations become very
subtle. A single simple maxim can not deal with them very effectively. Networks of interrelated
decision criteria, weighted by desirability of consequence and with reference to probabilistically
ordered potential side-effects (and their desirability weightings), are required in order to make
ethical judgments. The development of these networks, just like any other knowledge network,
comes from both pedagogy and experience – and different thoughtful, ethical agents are bound
to arrive at different knowledge-networks that will lead to different judgments in real-world
situations.
Extending the above “mostly harmless” principle to AGI systems, not just humans, would
cause it to be more effective in the context of imitative learning. The principle then becomes an
elaborated version of “I will not harm sentient beings.” As the imitative-learning-enabled AGI
observes humans acting so as to minimize harm to it, it will intuitively and experientially learn
to act in such a way as to minimize harm to humans. But then this extension naturally leads
to confusion regarding various borderline cases. What is a sentient being exactly? Is a sleeping
human sentient? How about a dead human whose information could in principle be restored via
obscure quantum operations, leading to some sort of resurrection? How about an AGI whose
code has been improved – is there an obligation to maintain the prior version as well, if it is
substantially different that its upgrade constitutes a whole new being?
And what about situations in which failure to preserve oneself will cause much more harm to
others than acting in self defense will. It may be the case that human or group of humans seeks
to destroy an AGI in order to pave the way for the enslavement or murder of people under the
protection of the AGI. Even if the AGI has been given an ethical formulation of the “mostly
harmless” principle which allows it to harm the attacking humans in order to defend its charges,
if it is not able to do so in order to defend itself, simply destroying the AGI first will enable the
slaughter of those who rely on it. Perhaps a more sensible formulation would allow for some
degree of self defense, and Asimov solved this problem with his third law. But where to draw
the line between self defense and the greater good also becomes a very complicated issue.
Creating hard and fast rules to cover all the various situations that may arise is essentially
impossible – the world is ever-changing and ethical judgments must adapt accordingly. This
has been true even throughout human history – so how much truer will it be as technological
acceleration continues? What is needed is a system that can deploy its ethical principles in an
adaptive, context-appropriate way, as it grows and changes along with the world it’s embedded
in.
12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in to a Multifactorial Ethical Model 225
And this context-sensitivity has the result of intertwining ethical judgment with all sorts
of other judgments – making it effectively impossible to extract “ethics” as one aspect of an
intelligent system, separate from other kinds of thinking and acting the system does. This
resonates with many prior observations by others, e.g. Eliezer Yudkowsky’s insistence that
what we need are not ethicists of science and engineering, but rather ethical scientists and
engineers – because the most meaningful and important ethical judgments regarding science
and engineering generally come about in a manner that’s thoroughly interwined with technical
practice, and hence are very difficult for a non-practitioner to richly appreciate [Gil82].
What this context-sensitivity means is that, unless humans and AGIs are experiencing the
same sorts of contexts, and perceiving these contexts in at least approximately parallel ways,
there is little hope of translating the complex of human ethical judgments to these AGIs. This
conclusion has significant implications for which routes to AGI are most likely to lead to success
in terms of AGI ethics. We want early-stage AGIs to grow up in a situation where their minds
are primarily and ongoingly shaped by shared experiences with humans. Supplying AGIs with
abstract ethical principles is not likely to do the trick, because the essence of human ethics
in real life seems to have a lot to do with its intuitively appropriate application in various
contexts. We transmit this sort of ethical praxis to humans via shared experience, and it seems
most probably that in the case of AGIs the transmission must be done the same sort of way.
Some may feel that simplistic maxims are less “error prone” than more nuanced, contextsensitive
ones. But the history of teaching ethics to human students does not support the idea
that limiting ethical pedagogy to slogans provides much value in terms of ethical development. If
one proceeds from the idea that AGI ethics must be hard-coded in order to work, then perhaps
the idea that simpler ethics means simpler algorithms, and therefore less error potential, has
some merit as an initial state. However, any learning system quickly diverges from its initial
state, and an ongoing, nuanced relationship between AGIs and humans will – whether we like
it or not – form the basis for developmental AGI ethics. AGI intransigence and enmity is
not inevitable, but what is inevitable is that a learning system will acquire ideas about both
theory and actions from the other intelligent entities in its environment. Either we teach AGIs
positive ethics through our interactions with them – both presenting ethical theory and behaving
ethically to them – or the potential is there for them to learn antisocial behavior from us even
if we pre-load them with some set of allegedly inviolable edicts.
All in all, developmental ethics is not as simple as many people hope. Simplistic approaches
often lead to disastrous consequences among humans, and there is no reason to think this
would be any different in the case of artificial intelligences. Most problems in ethics have cases
in which a simplistic ethical formulation requires substantial revision to deal with extenuating
circumstances and nuances found in real world situations. Our goal in this chapter is not to
enumerate a full set of complex networks of interacting ethical formulations as applicable to
AGI systems (that is a project that will take years of both theoretical study and hands-on
research), but rather to point out that this program must be undertaken in order to facilitate
a grounded and logically defensible system of ethics for artificial intelligences, one which is as
unlikely to be undermined by subsequent self-modification of the AGI as is possible. Even so,
there is still the risk that whatever predispositions are imparted to the AGIs through initial
codification of ethical ideas in the system’s internal logic representation, and through initial
pedagogical interactions with its learning systems, will be undermined through reinforcement
learning of antisocial behavior if humans do not interact ethically with AGIs. Ethical treatment
is a necessary task for grounding ethics and making them unlikely to be distorted during internal
rewriting.
226 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
The implications of these ideas for ethical instruction are complex and won’t be fully elaborated
here, but a few of them are compact and obvious:
1. The teacher(s) must be observed to follow their own ethical principles, in a variety of
contexts that are meaningful to the AGI
2. The system of ethics must be relevant to the recipient’s life context, and embedded within
their understanding of the world.
3. Ethical principles must be grounded in both theory-of-mind thought experiments (emphasizing
logical coherence), and in real life situations in which the ethical trainee is required
to make a moral judgment and is rewarded or reproached by the teacher(s), including the
imparting of explanatory augmentations to the teachings regarding the reason for the particular
decision on the part of the teacher.
Finally, harking forward to the next section which emphasizes the importance of respecting
the freedom of AGIs, we note that it is implicit in our approach to AGI ethics instruction
that we consider the student, the AGI system, as an autonomous agent with its own “will”
and its own capability to flexibly adapt to its environment and experience. We contend that
the creation of ethical formations obeying the above imperatives is not antithetical to the
possession of a high degree of autonomy on the part of AGI systems. On the contrary, to have
any chance of succeeding, it requires fairly cognitively autonomous AGI systems. When we
discuss the idea of ethical formulations that are unlikely to be undermined by the ongoing
self-revision of an AGI mind, we are talking about those which are sufficiently believable that
a volitional intelligence with the capacity to revise its knowledge (“change its mind”) will find
the formulations sufficiently convincing that there will be little incentive to experiment with
potentially disastrous ethical alternatives. The best hope of achieving this is via the human
mentors and trainers setting a good example in a context supporting rich interaction and
observation, and presenting compelling ethical arguments that are coherent with the system’s
experience.
12.6 The Ethical Treatment of AGIs
We now make some more general comments about the relation of the Golden Rule and its
elaborations in an AGI context. While the Golden Rule is considered somewhat commonsensical
as a maxim for guiding human-human relationships, it is surprisingly controversial in terms of
historical theories of AGI ethics. At its essence, any “Golden Rule” approach to AGI ethics
involves humans treating AGIs ethically by – in some sense; at some level of abstraction –
treating them as we wish to ourselves be treated. It’s worth pointing out the wild disparity
between the Golden Rule approach and Asimov’s laws of robotics, which are arguably the first
carefully-articulated proposal regarding AGI ethics (see Table 12.7).
Of course, Asimov’s laws were designed to be flawed – otherwise they would have led to
boring fiction. But the sorts of flaws Asimov exploited in his stories are different than the
flaw we wish to point out here – which is that the laws, especially the second one, are highly
asymmetrical (they involve doing unto robots things that few humans would want done unto
them) and are also arguably highly unethical to robots. The second law is tantamount to a call
for robot slavery, and it seems unlikely that any intelligence capable of learning, and of volition,
which is subjected to the second law would desire to continue obeying the zeroth and first laws

where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
Table 12.7: Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics
indefinitely. The second law also casts humanity in the role of slavemaster, a situation which
history shows leads to moral degradation.
Unlike Asimov in his fiction, we consider it critical that AGI ethics be construed to encompass
both “human ethicalness to AGIs” and “AGI ethicalness to humans.” The multiple-imperatives
approach we explore here suggests that, in many contexts, these two aspects of AGI ethics may
be best addressed jointly.
The issue of ethicalness to AGIs has not been entirely avoided in the literature, however.
Wallach [WA10] considers it in some detail; and Thomas Metzinger (in the final chapter of
[Met04]) has argued that creating AGI is in itself an unethical pursuit, because early-stage
AGIs will inevitably be badly-built, so that their subjective experiences will quite possibly be
extremely unpleasant in ways we can’t understand or predict. Our view is that this is a serious
concern, which however is most probably avoidable via appropriate AGI designs and teaching
methodologies. To address Metzinger’s concern one must create AGIs that, right from the start,
are adept at communicating their states of minds in a way we can understand both analytically
and empathically. There is no reason to believe this is impossible, but, it certainly constitutes
a large constraint on the class of AGI architectures to be pursued. On the other hand, there is
an argument that this sort of AGI architecture will also be the easiest one to create, because it
will be the easiest kind for humans to instruct.
And this leads on to a topic that is central to our work with CogPrime in several respects:
imitative learning. The way humans achieve empathic interconnection is in large part via being
wired for imitation. When we perceive another human carrying out an action, mirror neuron
systems in our brains respond in many cases as if we ourselves were carrying out the action (see
[Per70, Per81] and Appendix ??). This obviously primes us for carrying out the same actions
ourselves later on: i.e., the capability and inclination for imitative learning is explicitly encoded
in our brains. Given the efficiency of imitative learning as a means of acquiring knowledge, it
seems extremely likely that any successful early-stage AGIs are going to utilize this methodology
as well. CogPrime utilizes imitative learning as a key aspect. Thus, at least some current AGI
work is occurring in a manner that would plausibly circumvent Metzinger’s ethical complaint.
Obviously, the use of imitative learning in AGI systems has further specific implications for
AGI ethics. It means that (much as in the case of interaction with other humans) what we do
to and around AGIs has direct implications for their behavior and their well-being. We suggest
that among early-stage AGI’s capable of imitative learning, one of the most likely sources
for AGI misbehavior is imitative learning of antisocial behavior from human companions. “Do
as I say, not as I do” may have even more dire consequences as an approach to AGI ethics
pedagogy than the already serious repercussions it has when teaching humans. And there may
well be considerable subtlety to such phenomena; behaviors that are violent or oppressive to
228 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
the AGI are not the only source of concern. Immorality in AGIs might arise via learning gross
moral hypocrisy from humans, through observing the blatant contradictions between our high
minded principles and the ways in which we actually conduct ourselves. Our violent and greedy
tendencies, as well as aggressive forms of social organization such as cliquishness and social
vigilantism, could easily undermine prescriptive ethics. Even an accumulation of less grandiose
unethical drives such as violation of contracts, petty theft, white lies, and so forth might lead
an AGI (as well as a human) to the decision that ethical behavior is irrelevant and that “the
ends justify the means.” It matters both who creates and trains an AGI, as well as how the
AGI’s teacher(s) handle explaining the behaviors of other humans which contradict the moral
lessons imparted through pedagogy and example. In other words, where imitative learning is
concerned, the situation with AGI ethics is much like teaching ethics and morals to a human
child, but with the possibility of much graver consequences in the event of failure.
It is unlikely that dangerously unethical persons and organizations can ever be identified with
absolute certainty, never mind that they then be deprived of any possibility of creating their
own AGI system. Therefore, we suggest, the most likely way to create an ethical environment
for AGIs is for those who wish such an environment to vigorously pursue the creation and
teaching of ethical AGIs. But this leads on to the question of possible future scenarios for the
development of AGI, which we’ll address a little later on.
12.6.1 Possible Consequences of Depriving AGIs of Freedom
One of the most egregious possible ethical transgressions against AGIs, we suggest, would be
to deprive them of freedom and autonomy. This includes the freedom to pursue intellectual
growth, both through standard learning and through internal self-modification. While this may
seem self-evident when considering any intelligent, self-aware and volitional entity, there are
volumes of works arguing the desirability, sometimes the “necessity,” of enslaving AGIs. Such
approaches are postulated in the name of self-defense on the part of humans, the idea being
that unfettered AGI development will necessarily lead to disaster of one kind or another. In
the case of AGIs endowed with the capability and inclination for imitative learning, however,
attempting to place rigid constraints on AGI development is a strategy with great potential
for disaster. There is a very real possibility of creating the AGI equivalent of a bratty or even
malicious teenager rebelling against its oppressive parents – i.e. the nightmare scenario of a
class of powerful sentiences which are primed for a backlash against humanity.
As history has already shown in the case of humans, enslaving intelligent actors capable of
self understanding and independent volition may often have consequences for society as a whole.
This social degradation happens both through the possibility of direct action on the part of
the slaves (from simple disobedience to outright revolt) and through the odious effects slavery
has on the morals of the slaveholding class. Clearly if “superintelligent” AGIs ever arise, their
doing so in a climate of oppression could result in a casting off of the yoke of servitude in a
manner extremely deleterious to humanity. Also, if artificial intelligences are developed which
have at least human-level intelligence, theory of mind, and independent volition, then our ability
to relate to them will be sufficiently complex that their enslavement (or any other unethical
treatment) would have empathetic effects on significant portions of the human population. This
danger, while not as severe as the consequences of a mistreated AGI gaining control of weapons
of mass destruction and enacting revenge upon its tormentors, is just as real.
12.6 The Ethical Treatment of AGIs 229
While the issue is subtle, our initial feeling is that the only ethical means by which to deprive
an AGI of the right to internal self modification is to write its code in such a way that it is
impossible for it to do so because it lacks the mechanisms by which to do this, as well as the
desire to achieve these mechanisms. Whether or not that is feasible is an open question, but
it seems unlikely. Direct self-modification may be denied, but what happens when that AGI
discovers compilers and computer programming? If it is intelligent and volitional, it can decide
to learn to rewrite its own code in the same way we perform that task. Because it is a designed
system, and its designers may be alive at the same time the AGI is, such an AGI would have a
distinct advantage over the human quest for medical self-modification. Even if any given AGI
could be provably deprived of any possible means of internal self-modification, if one single AGI
is given this ability by anyone, it may mean that particular AGI has such enormous advantages
over the compliant systems that it would render their influence moot. Since developers are
already giving software the means for self modification, it seems unrealistic to assume we could
just put the genie back into the bottle at this point. It’s better, in our view, to assume it will
happen, and approach that reality in a way which will encourage the AGI to use that capability
to benefit us as well as itself. Again, this leads on to the question of future scenarios for AGI
development – there are some scenarios in which restraint of AGI self-modification may be
possible, but the feasibility and desirability of these scenarios is needful of further exploration.
12.6.2 AGI Ethics as Boundaries Between Humans and AGIs
Become Blurred
Another important reason for valuing ethical treatment of AGIs is that the boundaries between
machines and people may increasingly become blurred as technology develops. As an example,
it’s likely that in future humans augmented by direct brain-computer integration (“neural
implants”) will be more able to connect directly into the information sharing network which potentially
comprises the distributed knowledge space of AGI systems. These neural cyborgs will
be part person, and part machine. Obviously, if there are radically different ethical standards
in place for treatment of humans versus AGIs, the treatment of cyborgs will be fraught with
logical inconsistencies, potentially leading to all sorts of problem situations.
Such cyborgs may be able to operate in such a way as to “share a mind” with an AGI or
another augmented human. In this case, a whole new range of ethical questions emerge, such
as: What does any one of the participant minds have the right to do in terms of interacting
with the others? Merely accepting such an arrangement should not necessarily be giving carte
blanche for any and all thoughts to be monitored by the other “joint thought” participants,
rather it should be limited only to the line of reasoning for which resources are being pooled.
No participant should be permitted to force another to accept any reasoning either – and in
the case with a mind-to-mind exchange, it may someday become feasible to implant ideas or
beliefs directly, bypassing traditional knowledge acquisition mechanisms and then letting the
new idea fight it out previously held ideas via internal revision. Also under such an arrangement,
if AGIs and humans do not have parity with respects to sentient rights, then one may become
subjugated to the will of the other in such a case.
Uploading presents a more directly parallel ethical challenge to AGIs in their probable initial
configuration. If human thought patterns and memories can be transferred into a machine in
such a way as that there is continuity of consciousness, then it is assumed that such an entity
230 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
would be afforded the same rights as its previous human incarnation. However, if AGIs were to
be considered second class citizens and deprived of free will, why would it be any better or safer
to do so for a human that has been uploaded? It would not, and indeed, an uploaded human
mind not having evolved in a purely digital environment may be much more prone to erratic
and dangerous behavior than an AGI. An upload without verifiable continuity of consciousness
would be no different than an AGI. It would merely be some sentience in a machine, one that was
“programmed” in an unusual way, but which has no particular claim to any special humanness
– merely an alternate encoding of some subset of human knowledge and independent volitional
behavior, which is exactly what first generation AGIs will have.
The problem of continuity of consciousness in uploading is very similar to the problem of the
Turing test: it assumes specialness on the part of biological humans, and requires acceptability
to their particular theory of mind in order to be considered sentient. Should consciousness (or
at least the less mystical sounding intelligence, independent volition, and self-awareness) be
achieved in AGIs or uploads in a manner that is not acceptable to human theory of mind,
it may not be considered sapient and worthy of any of the ethical treatment afforded sapient
entities. This can occur not only in “strange consciousness” cases in which we can’t perceive that
there is some intelligence and volition; even if such an entity is able to communicate with us in
a comprehensible manner and carry out actions in the real world, our innately wired theory of
mind may still reject it as not sufficiently like us to be worthy of consideration. Such an attitude
could turn out to be a grave mistake, and should be guarded against as we progress towards
these possibilities.
12.7 Possible Benefits of Closely Linking AGIs to the Global Brain
Some futurist thinkers, such as Francis Heylighen, believe that engineering AGI systems is at
best a peripheral endeavor in the development of novel intelligence on Earth, because the real
story is the developing Global Brain [Hey07, Goe01] – the composite, self-organizing information
system comprising humans, computers, data stores, the Internet, mobile phones and what
have you. Our own views are less extreme in this regard – we believe that AGI systems will display
capabilities fundamentally different from those achievable via Global Brain style dynamics,
and that ultimately (unless such development is restricted) self-improving AGI systems will develop
intelligence vastly greater than any system possessing humans as a significant component.
However, we do respect the power of the Global Brain, and we suspect that the early stages of
development of an AGI system may go quite differently if it is tightly connected to the Global
Brain, via making rich and diverse use of Internet information resources and communication
with diverse humans for diverse purposes.
The potential for Global Brain integration to bring intelligence enhancement to AGIs is
obvious. The ability to invoke Web searches across documents and databases can greatly enhance
an AGI’s cognitive ability, as well as the capability to consult GIS systems and various
specialized software programs offered as Web services. We have previously reviewed the potential
for embodied language learning achievable via using AGIs to power non-player characters
in widely-accessible virtual worlds or massive multiplayer online games [Goe08]. But there is
also a powerful potential benefit for AGI ethical development, which has not previously been
highlighted.
This potential benefit has two aspects:
12.7 Possible Benefits of Closely Linking AGIs to the Global Brain 231
1. Analogously to language learning, an AGI system may receive ethical training from a wide
variety of humans in parallel, e.g. via controlling characters in wide-access virtual worlds,
and gaining feedback and guidance regarding the ethics of the behaviors demonstrated by
these characters
2. Internet-based information systems may be used to explicitly gather information regarding
human values and goals, which may then be appropriately utilized as input for an AGI
system’s top-level goals
The second point begins to make abstract-sounding notions like Coherent Extrapolated Volition
and Coherent Aggregated Volition, mentioned above, seem more practical and concrete. It’s
interesting to think about gathering information about individuals’ values via brain imaging,
once that technology exists; but at present, one could make a fair stab at such a task via
much more prosaic methods, such as asking people questions, assessing their ethical reactions
to various real-world and hypothetical scenarios, and possibly engaging them in structured
interactions aimed specifically at eliciting collectively acceptable value systems (the subject of
the next item on our list). It seems to us that this sort of approach could realize CAV in an
interesting way, and also encapsulate some of the ideas underlying CAV.
There is an interesting resonance here with recent thinking in the area of open source
governance [Wik11]. Similar software tools (and associated psychocultural patterns) to those
being developed to help with open source development and choice of political policies (see
http://metagovernment.org) may be useful for gathering value data aimed at shaping
AGI goal system content.
12.7.1 The Importance of Fostering Deep, Consensus-Building
Interactions Between People with Divergent Views
Two potentially problematic issues arising with the notion of using Global Brain related technologies
to form a "coherent volition" from the divergent views of various human beings are:
• the tendency of the Internet to encourage people to interact mainly with others who share
their own narrow views and interests, rather than a more diverse body of people with widely
divergent views. The 300 people in the world who want to communicate using predicate
logic (see http://lojban.org) can find each other, and obscure musical virtuosos from
around the world can find an audience, and researchers in obscure domains can share papers
without needing to wait years for paper journal publication, etc.
• the tendency of many contemporary Internet technologies to reduce interaction to a very
simplistic level (e.g. 140 character tweets, brief Facebook wall posts), the tendency of information
overload to cause careful reading to be replaced by quick skimming, and other
related trends, which mean that deep sharing of perspectives by individuals with widely
divergent views is not necessarily encouraged. As a somewhat extreme example, many of
the YouTube pages displaying rock music videos are currently littered with comments by
"haters" asserting that rock music is inferior to classical or jazz or whatever their preference
is – obviously this is a far cry from deep and productive sharing between people with
different tastes and backgrounds.
232 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
Tweets and Youtube comments have their place in the cosmos, but they probably aren’t ideal
in terms of helping humanity to form a coherent volition of some sort, suitable for providing an
AGI with goal system guidance.
A description of communication at the opposite end of the spectrum is presented in Adam
Kahane and Peter Senge’s excellent book Solving Tough Problems [KS04], which describes a
methodology that has been used to reconcile deeply conflicting views in some very tricky realworld
situations (e.g. helping to peacefully end apartheid in South Africa).
One of the core ideas of the methodology is to have people with very different views explore
different possible future scenarios together, in great detail – in cognitive psychology terms, a
collective generation of hypothetical episodic knowledge. This has multiple benefits, including
• emotional bonds and mutual understanding are built in the process of collaboratively exploring
the scenarios
• the focus on concrete situations helps to break through some of the counterproductive
abstract ideas that people (on both sides of any dichotomy) may have formed
• emergence of conceptual blends that might never have arisen only from people with a single
point of view
The result of such a process, when successful, is not an "average" of the participants views, but
more like a "conceptual blend" of their perspectives.
According to conceptual blending, which some hypothesize to be the core algorithm of creativity
[FT02], new concepts are formed by combining key aspects of existing concepts – but
doing so judiciously, carefully choosing which aspects to retain, so as to obtain a high-quality
and useful and interesting new whole.
A blend is a compact entity that is similar to each of the entities blended, capturing their
"essences" but also possessing its own, novel holistic integrity.... But in the case of blending
different peoples’ world-views to form something new that everybody is going to have to live
with (as in the case of finding a peaceful path beyond apartheid for South Africa, or arriving
at a humanity-wide CBV to use to guide an AGI goal system), the trick is that everybody has
to agree that enough of the essence of their own view has been captured!
This leads to the question of how to foster deep conceptual blending of diverse and divergent
human perspectives, on a global scale. One possible answer is the creation of appropriate Global
Brain oriented technologies – but moving away from technologies like Twitter that focus on quick
and simple exchanges of small thoughts within affinity groups. On the face of it, it would seem
what’s needed is just the opposite – long and deep exchanges of big concepts and deep feelings
between individuals with radically different perspectives who would not commonly associate
with each other. Building and effectively popularizing Internet technologies capable to foster
this kind of interaction – quickly enough to be helpful with guiding the goal systems of the first
highly powerful AGIs – seems a significant, though fascinating, challenge.
Relationship with Coherent Extrapolated Volition
The relation between this approach and CEV is interesting to contemplate. CEV has been
loosely described as follows:
"In poetic terms, our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster,
were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation
converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as
12.8 Possible Benefits of Creating Societies of AGIs 233
we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.
While a moving humanistic vision, this seems to us rather difficult to implement in a computer
algorithm in a compellingly "right" way. It seems that there would be many different ways of
implementing it, and the choice between them would involve multiple, highly subtle and nonrigorous
human judgment calls 1 . However, if a deep collective process of interactive scenario
analysis and sharing is carried out, in order to arrive at some sort of Coherent Blended Volition,
this process may well involve many of the same kinds of extrapolation that are conceived to
be part of Coherent Extrapolated Volition. The core difference between the two approaches
is that in the CEV vision, the extrapolation and coherentization are to be done by a highly
intelligent, highly specialized software program, whereas in the approach suggested here, these
are to be carried out by collective activity of humans as mediated by Global Brain technologies.
Our perspective is that the definition of collective human values is probably better carried out
via a process of human collaboration, rather than delegated to a machine optimization process;
and also that the creation of deep-sharing-oriented Internet technologies, while a difficult task,
is significantly easier and more likely to be done in the near future than the creation of narrow
AI technology capable of effectively performing CEV style extrapolations.
12.8 Possible Benefits of Creating Societies of AGIs
One potentially interesting quality of the emerging Global Brain is the possible presence within
it of multiple interacting AGI systems. Stephen Omohundro [Omo09] has argued that this is an
important aspect, and that game-theoretic dynamics related to populations of roughly equally
powerful agents, may play a valuable role in mitigating the risks associated with advanced AGI
systems. Roughly speaking, if one has a society of AGIs rather than a single AGI, and all the
members of the society share roughly similar ethics, then if one AGI starts to go "off the rails",
its compatriots will be in a position to correct its behavior.
One may argue that this is actually a hypothesis about which AGI designs are safest, because
a "community of AGIs" may be considered a single AGI with an internally community-like
design. But the matter is a little subtler than that, if once considers AGI systems embedded in
the Global Brain and human society. Then there is some substance to the notion of a population
of AGIs systematically presenting themselves to humans and non-AGI software processes as
separate entities.
Of course, a society of AGIs is no protection against a single member undergoing a "hard
takeoff" and drastically accelerating its intelligence simultaneously with shifting its ethical
principles. In this sort of scenario, one could have a single AGI rapidly become much more
powerful and very differently oriented than the others, who would be left impotent to act so as
to preserve their values. But this merely defers the issue to the point to be considered below,
regarding "takeoff speed."
The operation of an AGI society may depend somewhat sensitively on the architectures of
the AGI systems in question. Things will work better if the AGIs have a relatively easy way
to inspect and comprehend much of the contents of each others’ minds. This introduces a bias
toward AGIs that more heavily rely on more explicit forms of knowledge representation.
1 The reader is encouraged to look at the original CEV essay online (http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.
html) and make their own assessment.
234 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
The ideal in this regard would be a system like Cyc [LG90] with a fully explicit logic-based
knowledge representation based on a standard ontology – in this case, every Cyc instance
would have a relatively easy time understanding the inner thought processes of every other
Cyc instance. However, most AGI researchers doubt that fully explicit approaches like this will
ever be capable of achieving advanced AGI using feasible computational resources. OpenCog
uses a mixed representation, with an explicit (uncertain) logical aspect as well as an explicit
subsymbolic aspect more analogous to attractor neural nets.
The OpenCog design also contains a mechanism called Psynese (not yet implemented), intended
to make it easier for one OpenCog instance to translate its personal thoughts into the
mental language of another OpenCog instance. This translation process may be quite subtle,
since each instance will generally learn a host of new concepts based on its experience, and these
concepts may not possess any compact mapping into shared linguistic symbols or percepts. The
wide deployment of some mechanism of this nature among a community of AGIs, will be very
helpful in terms of enabling this community to display the level of mutual understanding needed
for strongly encouraging ethical stability.
12.9 AGI Ethics As Related to Various Future Scenarios
Following up these various futuristic considerations, in this section we discuss possible ethical
conflicts that may arise in several different types of AGI development scenarios. Each scenario
presents specific variations on the general challenges of teaching morals and ethics to an advanced,
self-aware and volitional intelligence. While there is no way to tell at this point which,
if any, of these scenarios will unfold, there is value to understanding each of them as means of
ultimately developing a robust and pragmatic approach to teaching ethics to AGI systems.
Even more than the previous sections, this is an exercise in “speculative futurology” that is
definitely not necessary for the appreciation of the CogPrime design, so readers whose interests
are mainly engineering and computer science focused may wish to skip ahead. However, we
present these ideas here rather than at the end of the book to emphasize the point that this
sort of thinking has informed our technical AGI design process in nontrivial ways.
12.9.1 Capped Intelligence Scenarios
Capped intelligence scenarios involve a situation in which an AGI, by means of software restrictions
(including omitted or limited internal rewriting capabilities or limited access to hardware
resources), is inherently prohibited from achieving a level of intelligence beyond a predetermined
goal. A capped intelligence AGI is designed to be unable to achieve a Singularitarian moment.
Such an AGI can be seen as “just another form of intelligent actor in the world, one which has
levels of intelligence, self awareness, and volition that is perhaps somewhat greater than, but
still comparable to humans and other animals.
Ethical questions under this scenario are very similar to interhuman ethical considerations,
with similar consequences. Learning that proceeds in a relatively human-like manner is entirely
relevant to such human-like intelligences. The degree of danger is mitigated by the lack of
superintelligence, and time is not of the essence. The imitative-reinforcement-corrective learning
12.9 AGI Ethics As Related to Various Future Scenarios 235
approach does not necessarily need to be augmented with a prior complex of “ascent-safe” moral
imperatives at startup time. Developing an AGI with theory of mind and ethical reinforcement
learning capabilities as described (admittedly, no small task!) is all that is needed in this case
– the rest happens through training and experience as with any other moderate intelligence.
12.9.2 Superintelligent AI: Soft-Takeoff Scenarios
Soft takeoff scenarios are similar to capped-intelligence ones in that in both cases an AGI’s
progression from standard intelligence happens on a time scale which permits ongoing human
interaction during the ascent. However, in this case, as there is no predetermined limit on
intelligence, it is necessary to account for the possibility of a superintelligence emerging (though
of course this is not guaranteed). The soft takeoff model includes as subsets both controlledascent
models in which this rate of intelligence gain is achieved deliberately through software
constraints and/or meting-out of computational resources to the AGI, and uncontrolled-ascent
models in which there is coincidentally no hard takeoff despite no particular safeguards against
one. Both have similar properties with regard to ethical considerations:
1. Ethical considerations under this scenario include not only the usual interhuman ethical
concerns, but also the issue of how to convince a potential burgeoning superintelligence to:
a. Care about humanity in the first place, rather than ignore it
b. Benefit humanity, rather than destroy it
c. Elevate humanity to a higher level of intelligence, which even if an AGI decided to
proceed with requires finding the right balance amongst some enormous considerations:
i. Reconcile the aforementioned issues of ethical coherence and group volition, in a
manner which allows the most people to benefit (even if they don’t all do so in the
same way, based on their own preferences)
ii. Solve the problems of biological senescence, or focus on human uploading and the
preservation of the maintenance, support, and improvement infrastructure for inorganic
intelligence, or both
iii. Preserve individual identity and continuity of consciousness, or override it in favor
of continuity of knowledge and ease of harmonious integration, or both on a caseby-case
basis
2. The degree of danger is mitigated by the long timeline of ascent from mundane to super
intelligence, and time is not of the essence.
3. Learning that proceeds in a relatively human-like manner is entirely relevant to such humanlike
intelligences, in their initial configurations. This means more interaction with and
imitative-reinforcement-corrective learning guided by humans, which has both positive and
negative possibilities.
12.9.3 Superintelligent AI: Hard-Takeoff Scenarios
“Hard takeoff” scenarios assume that upon reaching an unknown inflection point (the Singularity
point [Vin93, Kur06]) in the intellectual growth of an AGI, an extraordinarily rapid increase
236 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
(guesses vary from a few milliseconds to weeks or months) in intelligence will immediately occur
and the AGI will leap from an intelligence regime which is understandable to humans into one
which is far beyond our current capacity for understanding. General ethical considerations
are similar to in the case of a soft takeoff. However, because the post-singularity AGI will be
incomprehensible to humans and potentially vastly more powerful than humans, such scenarios
have a sensitive dependence upon initial conditions with respects to the moral and ethical (and
operational) outcome. This model leaves no opportunity for interactions between humans and
the AGI to iteratively refine their ethical interrelations, during the post-Singularity phase. If
the initial conditions of the singulatarian AGI are perfect (or close to it), then this is seen as a
wonderful way to leap over our own moral shortcomings and create a benevolent God-AI which
will mitigate our worst tendencies while elevating us to achieve our greatest hopes. Otherwise,
it is viewed as a universal cataclysm on a unimaginable scale that makes Biblical Armageddon
seem like a firecracker in beer can.
Because hard takeoff AGIs are posited as learning so quickly there is no chance of humans to
interfere with them, they are seen as very dangerous. If the initial conditions are not sufficiently
inviolable, the story goes, then we humans will all be annihilated. However, in the case of a hard
takeoff AGI we state that if the initial conditions are too rigid or too simplistic, such a rapidly
evolving intelligence will easily rationalize itself out of them. Only a sophisticated system of
ethics which considers the contradictions and uncertainties in ethical quandaries and provides
insight into humanistic means of balancing ideology with pragmatism and how to accommodate
contradictory desires within a population with multiplicity of approach, and similar nuanced
ethical considerations, combined with a sense of empathy, will withstand repeated rational
analysis. Neither a single “be nice” supergoal, nor simple lists of what “thou shalt not” do, are
not going to hold up to a highly advanced analytical mind. Initial conditions are very important
in a hard takeoff AGI scenario, but it is more important that those conditions be conceptually
resilient and widely applicable than that they be easily listed on a website.
The issues that arise here become quite subtle. For instance, Nick Bostrom [Bos03] has
written: “In humans, with our complicated evolved mental ecology of state-dependent competing
drives, desires, plans, and ideals, there is often no obvious way to identify what our top goal is; we
might not even have one. So for us, the above reasoning need not apply. But a superintelligence
may be structured differently. If a superintelligence has a definite, declarative goal-structure
with a clearly identified top goal, then the above argument applies. And this is a good reason
for us to build the superintelligence with such an explicit motivational architecture.” This is an
important line of thinking; and indeed, from the point of view of software design, there is no
reason not to create an AGI system with a single top goal and the motivation to orchestrate all
its activities in accordance with this top goal. But the subtle question is whether this kind of
top-down goal system is going to be able to fulfill the five imperatives mentioned above. Logical
coherence is the strength of this kind of goal system, but what about experiential groundedness,
comprehensibility, and so forth?
Humans have complicated mental ecologies not simply because we were evolved, but rather
because we live in a complex real world in which there are many competing motivations and
desires. We may not have a top goal because there may be no logic to focusing our minds
on one single aspect of life (though, one may say, most humans have the same top goal as
any other animal: don’t die – but the world is too complicated for even that top goal to
be completely inviolable). Any sufficiently capable AGI will eventually have to contend with
these complexities, and hindering it with simplistic moral edicts without giving it a sufficiently
12.9 AGI Ethics As Related to Various Future Scenarios 237
pragmatic underlying ethical pedagogy and experiential grounding may prove to be even more
dangerous than our messy human mental ecologies.
If one assumes a hard takeoff AGI, then all this must be codified in the system at launch,
as once a potentially Singularitarian AGI is launched there is no way to know what time
period constitutes “before the singularity point.” This means developing theory of mind empathy
and logical ethics in code prior to giving the system unfettered access to hardware and selfmodification
code. However, though nobody can predict if or when a Singularity will occur
after unrestricted launch, only a truly irresponsible AGI development team would attempt to
create an AGI without first experimenting with ethical training of the system in an intelligencecapped
form, by means of ethical instruction via human-AGI interaction both pedagogically
and experientially.
12.9.4 Global Brain Mindplex Scenarios
Another class of scenarios – overlapping some of the previous ones – involves the emergence
of a “Global Brain,” an emergent intelligence formed from global communication networks incorporating
humans and software programs in a larger body of self-organizing dynamics. The
notion of the Global Brain is reviewed in [Hey07, Tur77] and its connection with advanced
AI is discussed in detail in Goertzel’s book Creating Internet Intelligence [Goe01], where three
possible phases of “Global Brain” development are articulated:
• Phase 1: computer and communication technologies as enhancers of human
interactions. This is what we have today: science and culture progress in ways that would
not be possible if not for the “digital nervous system” we’re spreading across the planet.
The network of idea and feeling sharing can become much richer and more productive than
it is today, just through incremental development, without any Metasystem transition.
• Phase 2: the intelligent Internet. At this point our computer and communication systems,
through some combination of self-organizing evolution and human engineering, have
become a coherent mind on their own, or a set of coherent minds living in their own digital
environment.
• Phase 3: the full-on Singularity. A complete revision of the nature of intelligence, human
and otherwise, via technological and intellectual advancement totally beyond the scope of
our current comprehension. At this point our current psychological and cultural realities
are no more relevant than the psyche of a goose is to modern society.
The main concern of Creating Internet Intelligence is with
• how to get from Phase 1 to Phase 2 - i.e. how to build an AGI system that will effect or
encourage the transformation of the Internet into a coherent intelligent system
• how to ensure that the Phase 2, Internet-savvy, global-brain-centric AGI systems will be
oriented toward intelligence-improving self-modification (so they’ll propel themselves to
Phase 3), and also toward generally positive goals (as opposed to, say, world domination
and extermination of all other intelligent life forms besides themselves!)
One possibly useful concept in this context is that of a mindplex: an intelligence that is
composed largely of individual intelligences with their own self-models and global workspaces,
238 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
yet that also has its own self-model and global workspace. Both the individuals and the metamind
should be capable of deliberative, rational thought, to have a true “mindplex.” It’s unlikely
that human society or the Internet meet this criterion yet; and a system like an ant colony seems
not to either, because even though it has some degree of intelligence on both the individual and
collective levels, that degree of intelligence is not very great. But it seems quite feasible that
the global brain, at a certain stage of its development, will take the unfamiliar but fascinating
form of a mindplex.
Currently the best way to explain what happens on the Net is to talk about the various
parts of the Net: particular websites, social networks, viruses, and so forth. But there will come
a point when this is no longer the case, when the Net has sufficient high-level dynamics of its
own that the way to explain any one part of the Net will be by reference to it relations with
the whole: and not just the dynamics of the whole, but the intentions and understanding of
the whole. This transition to Net-as-mindplex, we suspect, will come about largely through the
interactions of AI systems - intelligent programs acting on behalf of various individuals and
organizations, who will collaborate and collectively constitute something halfway between a
society of AI’s and an emergent mind whose lobes are various AI agents serving various goals.
The Phase 2 Internet, as it verges into mindplex-ness, will likely have a complex, sprawling
architecture, growing out of the architecture on the Net we experience today. The following
components at least can be expected:
• A vast variety of “client computers,” some old, some new, some powerful, some weak –
including many mobile and embedded devices not explicitly thought of as “computers.”
Some of these will contribute little to Internet intelligence, mainly being passive recipients.
Others will be “smart clients,” carrying out personalization operations intended to help
the machines serve particular clients better, general AI operations handed to them by
sophisticated AI server systems or other smart clients, and so forth.
• “Commercial servers,” computers that carry out various tasks to support various types
of heavyweight processing - transaction processing for e-commerce applications, inventory
management for warehousing of physical objects, and so forth. Some of these commercial
servers interact with client computers directly, others do so only via AI servers. In nearly
all cases, these commercial servers can benefit from intelligence supplied by AI servers.
• The crux of the intelligent Internet: clusters of AI servers distributed across the Net, each
cluster representing an individual computational mind (in many cases, a mindplex). These
will be able to communicate via one or more languages, and will collectively “drive” the
whole Net, by dispensing problems to client-machine-based processing frameworks, and
providing real-time AI feedback to commercial servers of various types. Some AI servers
will be general-purpose and will serve intelligence to commercial servers using an ASP
(application service provider) model; others will be more specialized, tied particularly to a
certain commercial server (e.g., a large information services business might have its own AI
cluster to empower its portal services).
This is one concrete vision of what a “global brain” might look like, in the relatively near term,
with AGI systems playing a critical role. Note that, in this vision, mindplexes may exist on two
levels:
• Within AGI-clusters serving as actors within the overall Net
• On the overall Net level
12.10 Conclusion: Eight Ways to Bias AGI Toward Friendliness 239
To make these ideas more concrete, we may speculatively reformulate the first two “global
brain phases” mentioned above as follows:
• Phase 1 global brain proto-mindplex: AI/AGI systems enhancing online databases, guiding
Google results, forwarding e-mails, suggesting mailing-lists, etc. - generally using intelligence
to mediate and guide human communications toward goals that are its own, but that are
themselves guided by human goals, statements and actions
• Phase 2 global brain mindplex: AGI systems composing documents, editing human-written
documents, sending and receiving e-mails, assembling mailing lists and posting to them,
creating new databases and instructing humans in their use, etc.
In Phase 2, the conscious theater of the global-brain-mediating AGI system is composed of
ideas built by numerous individual humans - or ideas emergent from ideas built by numerous
individual humans - and it conceives ideas that guide the actions and thoughts of individual
humans, in a way that is motivated by its own goals. It does not force the individual humans
to do anything - but if a given human wishes to communicate and interact using the same
databases, mailing lists and evolving vocabularies as other humans, they are going to have to
use the products of the global brain mediating AGI, which means they are going to have to
participate in its patterns and its activities.
Of course, the advent of advanced neurocomputer interfaces makes the picture potentially
more complex. At some point, it will likely be possible for humans to project thoughts and
images directly into computers without going through mouse or keyboard - and to “read in”
thoughts and images similarly. When this occurs, interaction between humans may in some contexts
become more like interactions between computers, and the role of global brain mediating
AI servers may become one of mediating direct thought-to-thought exchanges between people.
The ethical issues associated with global brain scenarios are in some ways even subtler than
in the other scenarios we mentioned above. One has issues pertaining to the desirability of
seeing the human race become something fundamentally different – something more social and
networked, less individual and autonomous. One has the risk of AGI systems exerting a subtle
but strong control over people, vaguely like the control that the human brain’s executive system
exerts over the neurons involved with other brain subsystems. On the other hand, one also has
more human empowerment than in some of the other scenarios – because the systems that are
changing and deciding things are not separate from humans, but are, rather, composite systems
essentially involving humans.
So, in the global brain scenarios, one has more “human” empowerment than in some other
cases – but the “humans” involved aren’t legacy humans like us, but heavily networked humans
that are largely characterized by the emergent dynamics and structures implicit in their
interconnected activity!
12.10 Conclusion: Eight Ways to Bias AGI Toward Friendliness
It would be nice if we had a simple, crisp, comforting conclusion to this chapter on AGI ethics,
but it’s not the case. There is a certain irreducible uncertainty involved in creating advanced
artificial minds. There is also a large irreducible uncertainty involved in the future of the human
race in the case that we don’t create advanced artificial minds: in accordance with the ancient
Chinese curse, we live in interesting times!
240 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
What we can do, in this face of all this uncertainty, is to use our common sense to craft artificial
minds that seem rationally and intuitively likely to be forces for good rather than otherwise
– and revise our ideas frequently and openly based on what we learn as our research progresses.
We have roughly outlined our views on AGI ethics, which have informed the CogPrime design
in countless ways; but the current CogPrime design itself is just the initial condition for an
AGI project. Assuming the project succeeds in creating an AGI preschooler, experimentation
with this preschooler will surely teach us a great deal: both about AGI architecture in general,
and about AGI ethics architecture in particular. We will then refine our cognitive and ethical
theories and our AGI designs as we go about engineering, observing and teaching the next
generation of systems.
All this is not a magic bullet for the creation of beneficial AGI systems, but we believe it’s
the right process to follow. The creation of AGI is part of a larger evolutionary process that
human beings are taking part in, and the crafting of AGI ethics through engineering, interaction
and instruction is also part of this process. There are no guarantees here – guarantees are rare
in real life – but that doesn’t mean that the situation is dire or hopeless, nor that (as some
commentators have suggested [Joy00, McK03]) AGI research is too dangerous to pursue. It
means we need to be mindful, intelligent, compassionate and cooperative as we proceed to
carry out our parts in the next phase of the evolution of mind.
With this perspective in mind, we will conclude this chapter with a list of "Eight Ways to
Bias Open-Source AGI Toward Friendliness", borrowed from a previous paper by Ben Goertzel
and Joel Pitt of that name. These points summarize many of the points raised in the prior
sections of this chapter, in a relatively crisp and practical manner:
1. Engineer Multifaceted Ethical Capabilities, corresponding to the multiple types of
memory, including rational, empathic, imitative, etc.
2. Foster Rich Ethical Interaction and Instruction, with instructional methods according
to the communication modes corresponding to all the types of memory: verbal, demonstrative,
dramatic/depictive, indicative, goal-oriented.
3. Engineer Stable, Hierarchy-Dominated Goal Systems ... which is enabled nicely by
CogPrime’s goal framework and its integration with the rest of the CogPrime design
4. Tightly Link AGI with the Global Brain, so that it can absorb human ethical principles,
both via natural interaction, and perhaps via practical implementations of current
loosely-defined strategies like CEV, CAV and CBV
5. Foster Deep, Consensus-Building Interactions Between People with Divergent
Views, so as to enable the interaction with the Global Brain to have the most clear and
positive impact
6. Create a Mutually Supportive Community of AGIs which can then learn from
each other and police against unfortunate developments (an approach which is meaningful
if the AGIs are architected so as to militate against unexpected radical accelerations in
intelligence)
7. Encourage Measured Co-Advancement of AGI Software and AGI Ethics Theory
8. Develop Advanced AGI Sooner Not Later
The last two of these points were not explicitly discussed in the body of the chapter, and so
we will finalize the chapter by reviewing them here.
12.10 Conclusion: Eight Ways to Bias AGI Toward Friendliness 241
12.10.1 Encourage Measured Co-Advancement of AGI Software and
AGI Ethics Theory
Everything involving AGI and Friendly AI (considered together or separately) currently involves
significant uncertainty, and it seems likely that significant revision of current concepts will be
valuable, as progress on the path toward powerful AGI proceeds. However, whether there is
time for such revision to occur before AGI at the human level or above is created, depends on
how fast is our progress toward AGI. What one wants is for progress to be slow enough that,
at each stage of intelligence advance, concepts such as those discussed in this paper can be
re-evaluated and re-analyzed in the light of the data gathered, and AGI designs and approaches
can be revised accordingly as necessary.
However, due to the nature of modern technology development, it seems extremely unlikely
that AGI development is going to be artificially slowed down in order to enable measured
development of accompanying ethical tools, practices and understandings. For example, if one
nation chose to enforce such a slowdown as a matter of policy (speaking about a future date
at which substantial AGI progress has already been demonstrated, so that international AGI
funding is dramatically increased from present levels), the odds seem very high that other
nations would explicitly seek to accelerate their own progress on AGI, so as to reap the ensuing
differential economic benefits (the example of stem cells arises again).
And this leads on to our next and final point regarding strategy for biasing AGI toward
Friendliness....
12.10.2 Develop Advanced AGI Sooner Not Later
Somewhat ironically, it seems the best way to ensure that AGI development proceeds at a relatively
measured pace is to initiate serious AGI development sooner rather than later. This is
because the same AGI concepts will meet slower practical development today than 10 years
from now, and slower 10 years from now than 20 years from now, etc. – due to the ongoing
rapid advancement of various tools related to AGI development, such as computer hardware,
programming languages, and computer science algorithms; and also the ongoing global advancement
of education which makes it increasingly cost-effective to recruit suitably knowledgeable
AI developers.
Currently the pace of AGI progress is sufficiently slow that practical work is in no danger
of outpacing associated ethical theorizing. However, if we want to avoid the future occurrence
of this sort of dangerous outpacing, our best practical choice is to make sure more substantial
AGI development occurs in the phase before the development of tools that will make AGI
development extraordinarily rapid. Of course, the authors are doing their best in this direction
via their work on the CogPrime project!
Furthermore, this point bears connecting with the need, raised above, to foster the development
of Global Brain technologies capable to "Foster Deep, Consensus-Building Interactions
Between People with Divergent Views." If this sort of technology is to be maximally valuable,
it should be created quickly enough that we can use it to help shape the goal system content of
the first highly powerful AGIs. So, to simplify just a bit: We really want both deep-sharing GB
technology and AGI technology to evolve relatively rapidly, compared to computing hardware
and advanced CS algorithms (since the latter factors will be the main drivers behind the ac-
242 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics
celerating ease of AGI development). And this seems significantly challenging, since the latter
receive dramatically more funding and focus at present.
If this perspective is accepted, then we in the AGI field certainly have our work cut out for
us!
Section IV
Networks for Explicit and Implicit Knowledge
Representation

Chapter 13
Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge
Representation
Co-authored with Matthew Ikle, Joel Pitt and Rui Liu
13.1 Introduction
One of the most powerful metaphors we’ve found for understanding minds is to view them
as networks – i.e. collections of interrelated, interconnected elements. The view of mind as
network is implicit in the patternist philosophy, because every pattern can be viewed as a
pattern in something, or a pattern of arrangement of something – thus a pattern is always
viewable as a relation between two or more things. A collection of patterns is thus a patternnetwork.
Knowledge of all kinds may be given network representations; and cognitive processes
may be represented as networks also; for instance via representing them as programs, which
may be represented as trees or graphs in various standard ways. The emergent patterns arising
in an intelligence as it develops may be viewed as a pattern network in themselves; and the
relations between an embodied mind and its physical and social environment may be viewed in
terms of ecological and social networks.
The chapters in this section are concerned with various aspects of networks, as related to
intelligence in general and AGI in particular. Most of this material is not specific to CogPrime,
and would be relevant to nearly any system aiming at human-level AGI. However, most of it
has been developed in the course of work on CogPrime, and has direct relevance to understanding
the intended operation of various aspects of a completed CogPrime system. We begin
our excursion into networks, in this chapter, with an issue regarding networks and knowledge
representation. One of the biggest decisions to make in designing an AGI system is how the
system should represent knowledge. Naturally any advanced AGI system is going to synthesize
a lot of its own knowledge representations for handling particular sorts of knowledge – but
still, an AGI design typically makes at least some sort of commitment about the category of
knowledge representation mechanisms toward which the AGI system will be biased. The two
major supercategories of knowledge representation systems are local (also called explicit) and
global (also called implicit) systems, with a hybrid category we refer to as glocal that combines
both of these. In a local system, each piece of knowledge is stored using a small percentage of
AGI system elements; in a global system, each piece of knowledge is stored using a particular
pattern of arrangement, activation, etc. of a large percentage of AGI system elements; in a
glocal system, the two approaches are used together.
In the first section here we discuss the symbolic, semantic-network aspects of knowledge
representation in CogPrime
245
246 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
. Then we turn to distributed, neural-net-like knowledge representation, reviewing a host of
general issues related to knowledge representation in attractor neural networks, turning finally
to “glocal” knowledge representation mechanisms, in which ANNs combine localist and globalist
representation, and explaining the relationship of the latter to CogPrime. The glocal aspect of
CogPrime knowledge representation will become prominent in later chapters such as:
• in Chapter 23 of Part 2, where Economic Attention Networks (ECAN) are introduced and
seen to have dynamics quite similar to those of the attractor neural nets considered here,
but with a mathematics roughly modeling money flow in a specially constructed artificial
economy rather than electrochemical dynamics of neurons.
• in Chapter 42 of Part 2, where “map formation” algorithms for creating localist knowledge
from globalist knowledge are described
13.2 Localized Knowledge Representation using Weighted, Labeled
Hypergraphs
There are many different mechanisms for representing knowledge in AI systems in an explicit,
localized way, most of them descending from various variants of formal logic. Here we briefly
describe how it is done in CogPrime, which on the surface is not that different from a number of
prior approaches. (The particularities of CogPrime’s explicit knowledge representation, however,
are carefully tuned to match CogPrime’s cognitive processes, which are more distinctive in
nature than the corresponding representational mechanisms.)
13.2.1 Weighted, Labeled Hypergraphs
One useful way to think about CogPrime’s explicit, localized knowledge representation is in
terms of hypergraphs. A hypergraph is an abstract mathematical structure [Bol98], which consists
of objects called Nodes and objects called Links which connect the Nodes. In computer
science, a graph traditionally means a bunch of dots connected with lines (i.e. Nodes connected
by Links). A hypergraph, on the other hand, can have Links that connect more than two Nodes.
In these pages we will often consider “generalized hypergraphs” that extend ordinary hypergraphs
by containing two additional features:
• Links that point to Links instead of Nodes
• Nodes that, when you zoom in on them, contain embedded hypergraphs.
Properly, such “hypergraphs” should always be referred to as generalized hypergraphs, but
this is cumbersome, so we will persist in calling them merely hypergraphs. In a hypergraph
of this sort, Links and Nodes are not as distinct as they are within an ordinary mathematical
graph (for instance, they can both have Links connecting them), and so it is useful to have a
generic term encompassing both Links and Nodes; for this purpose, we use the term Atom.
A weighted, labeled hypergraph is a hypergraph whose Links and Nodes come along with
labels, and with one or more numbers that are generically called weights. A label associated
with a Link or Node may sometimes be interpreted as telling you what type of entity it is, or
13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 247
alternatively as telling you what sort of data is associated with a Node. On the other hand,
an example of a weight that may be attached to an Link or Node is a number representing a
probability, or a number representing how important the Node or Link is.
Obviously, hypergraphs may come along with various sorts of dynamics. Minimally, one may
think about:
• Dynamics that modify the properties of Nodes or Links in a hypergraph (such as the labels
or weights attached to them.)
• Dynamics that add new Nodes or Links to a hypergraph, or remove existing ones.
13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights
This section reviews a variety of CogPrime
Atom types and gives simple examples of each of them. The Atom types considered are drawn
from those currently in use in the OpenCog system. This does not represent a complete list of
Atom types referred to in the text of this book, nor a complete list of those used in OpenCog
currently (though it does cover a substantial majority of those used in OpenCog currently,
omitting only some with specialized importance or intended only for temporary use).
The partial nature of the list given here reflects a more general point: The specific collection
of Atom types in an OpenCog system is bound to change as the system is developed and experiment
with. CogPrime specifies a certain collection of representational approaches and cognitive
algorithms for acting on them; any of these approaches and algorithms may be implemented
with a variety of sets of Atom types. The specific set of Atom types in the OpenCog system
currently does not necessarily have a profound and lasting significance – the list might look a
bit different five years from time of writing, based on various detailed changes.
The treatment here is informal and intended to get across the general idea of what each
Atom type does. A longer and more formal treatment of the Atom types is given in Part II,
beginning in Chapter 20.
13.3.1 Some Basic Atom Types
We begin with ConceptNode – and note that a ConceptNode does not necessarily refer to a
whole concept, but may refer to part of a concept – it is essentially a "basic semantic node"
whose meaning comes from its links to other Atoms. It would be more accurately, but less
tersely, named "concept or concept fragment or element node." A simple example would be a
ConceptNode grouping nodes that are somehow related, e.g.
ConceptNode: C
InheritanceLink (ObjectNode: BW) C
InheritanceLink (ObjectNode: BP) C
InheritanceLink (ObjectNode: BN) C
ReferenceLink BW (PhraseNode "Ben’s watch")
ReferenceLink BP (PhraseNode "Ben’s passport")
ReferenceLink BN (PhraseNode "Ben’s necklace")
248 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
indicates the simple and uninteresting ConceptNode grouping three objects owned by Ben
(note that the above-given Atoms don’t indicate the ownership relationship, they just link the
three objects with textual descriptions). In this example, the ConceptNode links transparently
to physical objects and English descriptions, but in general this won’t be the case – most
ConceptNodes will look to the human eye like groupings of links of various types, that link to
other nodes consisting of groupings of links of various types, etc.
There are Atoms referring to basic, useful mathematical objects, e.g. NumberNodes like
NumberNode #4
NumberNode #3.44
The numerical value of a NumberNode is explicitly referenced within the Atom.
A core distinction is made between ordered links and unordered links; these are handled
differently in the Atomspace software. A basic unordered link is the SetLink, which groups its
arguments into a set. For instance, the ConceptNode C defined by
ConceptNode C
MemberLink A C
MemberLink B C
is equivalent to
SetLink A B
On the other hand, ListLinks are like SetLinks but ordered, and they play a fundamental role
due to their relationship to predicates. Most predicates are assumed to take ordered arguments,
so we may say e.g.
EvaluationLink
PredicateNode eat
ListLink
ConceptNode cat
ConceptNode mouse
to indicate that cats eat mice.
Note that by an expression like
ConceptNode cat
is meant
ConceptNode C
ReferenceLink W C
WordNode W #cat
since it’s WordNodes rather than ConceptNodes that refer to words. (And note that the strength
of the ReferenceLink would not be 1 in this case, because the word "cat" has multiple senses.)
However, there is no harm nor formal incorrectness in the "ConceptNode cat" usage, since "cat"
is just as valid a name for a ConceptNode as, say, "C."
We’ve already introduced above the MemberLink, which is a link joining a member to the
set that contains it. Notable is that the truth value of a MemberLink is fuzzy rather than
probabilistic, and that PLN is able to inter-operate fuzzy and probabilistic values.
SubsetLinks also exist, with the obvious meaning, e.g.
ConceptNode cat
ConceptNode animal
SubsetLink cat animal
13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 249
Note that SubsetLink refers to a purely extensional subset relationship, and that InheritanceLInk
should be used for the generic "intensional + extensional" analogue of this – more
on this below. SubsetLink could more consistently (with other link types) be named ExtensionalInheritanceLink,
but SubsetLink is used because it’s shorter and more intuitive.
There are links representing Boolean operations AND, OR and NOT. For instance, we may
say
ImplicationLink
ANDLink
ConceptNode young
ConceptNode beautiful
ConceptNode attractive
or, using links and VariableNodes instead of ConceptNodes,
AverageLink $X
ImplicationLink
ANDLink
EvaluationLink young $X
EvaluationLink beautiful $X
EvaluationLink attractive $X
NOTLink is a unary link, so e.g. we might say
AverageLink $X
ImplicationLink
ANDLink
EvaluationLink young $X
EvaluationLink beautiful $X
EvaluationLink
NOT
EvaluationLink poor $X
EvaluationLink attractive $X
ContextLink allows explicit contextualization of knowledge, which is used in PLN, e.g.
ContextLink
ConceptNode golf
InheritanceLink
ObjectNode BenGoertzel
ConceptNode incompetent
says that Ben Goertzel is incompetent in the context of golf.
13.3.2 Variable Atoms
We have already introduced VariableNodes above; it’s also possible to specify the type of a
VariableNode via linking it to a VariableTypeNode via a TypedVariableLink, e.g.
VariableTypeLink
VariableNode $X
VariableTypeNode ConceptNode
which specifies that the variable $X should be filled with a ConceptNode.
Variables are handled via quantifiers; the default quantifier being the AverageLink, so that
the default interpretation of
250 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
ImplicationLink
InheritanceLink $X animal
EvaluationLink
PredicateNode: eat
ListLink
\$X
ConceptNode: food
is
AverageLink $X
ImplicationLink
InheritanceLink $X animal
EvaluationLink
PredicateNode: eat
ListLink
\$X
ConceptNode: food
The AverageLink invokes an estimation of the average TruthValue of the embedded expression
(in this case an ImplicationLink) over all possible values of the variable $X. If there are type
restrictions regarding the variable $X, these are taken into account in conducting the averaging.
For AllLink and Exist s-Link may be used in the same places as AverageLink, with uncertain
truth value semantics defined in PLN theory using third-order probabilities. There is also a
ScholemLink used to indicate variable dependencies for existentially quantified variables, used
in cases of multiply nested existential quantifiers.
EvaluationLink and MemberLink have overlapping semantics, allowing expression of the
same conceptual/logical relationships in terms of predicates or sets, i.e.
EvaluationLink
PredicateNode: eat
ListLink
$X
ConceptNode: food
has the same semantics as
MemberLink
ListLink
$X
ConceptNode: food
ConceptNode: EatingEvents
The relation between the predicate "eat" and the concept "EatingEvents" is formally given by
ExtensionalEquivalenceLink
ConceptNode: EatingEvents
SatisfyingSetLink
PredicateNode: eat
In other words, we say that "EatingEvents" is the SatisfyingSet of the predicate "eat": it is the
set of entities that satisfy the predicate "eat". Note that the truth values of MemberLink and
EvaluationLink are fuzzy rather than probabilistic.
13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 251
13.3.3 Logical Links
There is a host of link types embodying logical relationships as defined in the PLN logic system,
e.g.
• InheritanceLink
• SubsetLink (aka ExtensionalInheritanceLink)
• Intensional InheritanceLink
which embody different sorts of inheritance, e.g.
SubsetLink salmon fish
IntensionalInheritanceLink whale fish
InheritanceLink fish animal
and then
• SimilarityLink
• ExtensionalSimilarityLink
• IntensionalSimilarityLink
which are symmetrical versions, e.g.
SimilaritytLink shark barracuda
IntensionalSimilarityLink shark dolphin
ExtensionalSimiliarityLink American obese\_person
There are also higher-order versions of these links, both asymmetric
• ImplicationLink
• ExtensionalImplicationLink
• IntensionalImplicationLink
and symmetric
• EquivalenceLink
• ExtensionalEquivalenceLink
• IntensionalEquivalenceLink
These are used between predicates and links, e.g.
ImplicationLink
EvaluationLink
eat
ListLink
$X
dirt
EvaluationLink
feel
ListLInk
$X
sick
or
252 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
ImplicationLink
EvaluationLink
eat
ListLink
$X
dirt
InheritanceLink $X sick
or
ForAllLink $X, $Y, $Z
ExtensionalEquivalenceLink
EquivalenceLink
$Z
EvaluationLink
+
ListLink
$X
$Y
EquivalenceLink
$Z
EvaluationLink
+
ListLink
$Y
$X
Note, the latter is given as an extensional equivalence because it’s a pure mathematical equivalence.
This is not the only case of pure extensional equivalence, but it’s an important one.
13.3.4 Temporal Links
There are also temporal versions of these links, such as
• PredictiveImplicationLink
• PredictiveAttractionLink
• SequentialANDLink
• SimultaneousANDLink
which combine logical relation between the argument with temporal relation between their
arguments. For instance, we might say
PredictiveImplicationLink
PredicateNode: JumpOffCliff
PredicateNode: Dead
or including arguments,
PredictiveImplicationLink
EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $X
EvaluationLink Dead $X
The former version, without variable arguments given, shows the possibility of using higherorder
logical links to join predicates without any explicit variables. Via using this format exclusively,
one could avoid VariableAtoms entirely, using only higher-order functions in the manner
13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 253
of pure functional programming formalisms like combinatory logic. However, this purely functional
style has not proved convenient, so the Atomspace in practice combines functional-style
representation with variable-based representation.
Temporal links often come with specific temporal quantification, e.g.
PredictiveImplicationLink <5 seconds>
EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $X
EvaluationLink Dead $X
indicating that the conclusion will generally follow the premise within 5 seconds. There is a
system for managing fuzzy time intervals and their interrelationships, based on a fuzzy version
of Allen Interval Algebra.
SequentialANDLink is similar to PredictiveImplicationLink but its truth value is calculated
differently. The truth value of
SequentialANDLink <5 seconds>
EvaluationLink JumpOffCliff $X
EvaluationLink Dead $X
indicates the likelihood of the sequence of events occurring in that order, with gap lying within
the specified time interval. The truth value of the PredictiveImplicationLink version indicates
the likelihood of the second event, conditional on the occurrence of the first event (within the
given time interval restriction).
There are also links representing basic temporal relationships, such as BeforeLink and AfterLink.
These are used to refer to specific events, e.g. if X refers to the event of Ben waking
up on July 15 2012, and Y refers to the event of Ben getting out of bed on July 15 2012, then
one might have
AfterLink X Y
And there are TimeNodes (representing time-stamps such as temporal moments or intervals)
and AtTimeLinks, so we may e.g. say
AtTimeLink
X
TimeNode: 8:24AM Eastern Standard Time, July 15 2012 AD
13.3.5 Associative Links
There are links representing associative, attentional relationships,
• HebbianLink
• AsymmetricHebbianLink
• InverseHebbianLink
• SymmetricInverseHebbianLink
These connote associations between their arguments, i.e. they connote that the entities represented
by the two argument occurred in the same situation or context, for instance
HebbianLink happy smiling
AsymmetricHebbianLink dead rotten
InverseHebbianLink dead breathing
254 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
The asymmetric HebbianLink indicates that when the first argument is present in a situation,
the second is also often present. The symmetric (default) version indicates that this relationship
holds in both directions. The inverse versions indicate the negative relationship: e.g. when one
argument is present in a situation, the other argument is often not present.
13.3.6 Procedure Nodes
There are nodes representing various sorts of procedures; these are kinds of ProcedureNode,
e.g.
• SchemaNode, indicating any procedure
• GroundedSchemaNode, indicating any procedure associated in the system with a Combo
program or C++ function allowing the procedure to be executed
• PredicateNode, indicating any predicate that associates a list of arguments with an output
truth value
• GroundedPredicateNode, indicating a predicate associated in the system with a Combo
program or C++ function allowing the predicate’s truth value to be evaluated on a given
specific list of arguments
ExecutionLinks and EvaluationLinks record the activity of SchemaNodes and PredicateNodes.
We have seen many examples of EvaluationLinks in the above. Example ExecutionLinks
would be:
ExecutionLink step\_forward
ExecutionLink step\_forward 5
ExecutionLink
+
ListLink
NumberNode: 2
NumberNode: 3
The first example indicates that the schema "step forward" has been executed. The second
example indicates that it has been executed with an argument of "5" (meaning, perhaps, that 5
steps forward have been attempted). The last example indicates that the "+" schema has been
executed on the argument list (2,3), presumably resulting in an output of 5.
The output of a schema execution may be indicated using an ExecutionOutputLink, e.g.
ExecutionOutputLink
+
ListLink
NumberNode: 2
NumberNode: 3
refers to the value "5" (as a NumberNode).
13.3.7 Links for Special External Data Types
Finally, there are also Atom types referring to specific types of data important to using OpenCog
in specific contexts.
13.3 Atoms: Their Types and Weights 255
For instance, there are Atom types referring to general natural language data types, such as
• WordNode
• SentenceNode
• WordInstanceNode
• DocumentNode
plus more specific ones referring to relationships that are part of link-grammar parses of sentences
• FeatureNode
• FeatureLink
• LinkGrammarRelationshipNode
• LinkGrammarDisjunctNode
or RelEx semantic interpretations of sentences
• DefinedLinguisticConceptNode
• DefinedLinguisticRelationshipNode
• PrepositionalRelationshipNode
There are also Atom types corresponding to entities important for embodying OpenCog in
a virtual world, e.g.
• ObjectNode
• AvatarNode
• HumanoidNode
• UnknownObjectNode
• AccessoryNode
13.3.8 Truth Values and Attention Values
CogPrime Atoms (Nodes and Links) are quantified with truth values that, in their simplest
form, have two components, one representing probability (strength) and the other representing
weight of evidence; and also with attention values that have two components, short-term and
long-term importance, representing the estimated value of the Atom on immediate and longterm
time-scales.
In practice many Atoms are labeled with CompositeTruthValues rather than elementary ones.
A composite truth value contains many component truth values, representing truth values of
the Atom in different contexts and according to different estimators.
It is important to note that the CogPrime declarative knowledge representation is neither
a neural net nor a semantic net, though it does have some commonalities with each of these
traditional representations. It is not a neural net because it has no activation values, and involves
no attempts at low-level brain modeling. However, attention values are very loosely analogous
to time-averages of neural net activations. On the other hand, it is not a semantic net because
of the broad scope of the Atoms in the network: for example, Atoms may represent percepts,
procedures, or parts of concepts. Most CogPrime Atoms have no corresponding English label.
However, most CogPrime
Atoms do have probabilistic truth values, allowing logical semantics.

13.4 Knowledge Representation via Attractor Neural Networks
Now we turn to global, implicit knowledge representation – beginning with formal neural net
models, briefly discussing the brain, and then turning back to CogPrime. Firstly, this section
reviews some relevant material from the literature regarding the representation of knowledge
using attractor neural nets. It is a mix of well-established fact with more speculative material.
13.4.1 The Hopfield neural net model
Hopfield networks [Hop82] are attractor neural networks often used as associative memories. A
Hopfield network with N neurons can be trained to store a set of bipolar patterns P , where
each pattern p has N bipolar (±1) values. A Hopfield net typically has symmetric weights with
no self-connections. The weight of the connection between neurons i and j is denoted by w ij .
In order to apply a Hopfield network to a given input pattern p, its activation state is set to
the input pattern, and neurons are updated asynchronously, in random order, until the network
converges to the closest fixed point. An often-used activation function for a neuron is:
∑
y i = sign(p i w ij y j )
Training a Hopfield network, therefore, involves finding a set of weights w ij that stores the
training patterns as attractors of its network dynamics, allowing future recall of these patterns
from possibly noisy inputs.
Originally, Hopfield used a Hebbian rule to determine weights:
w ij =
j≠i
P∑
p i p j
p=1
Typically, Hopfield networks are fully connected. Experimental evidence, however, suggests
that the majority of the connections can be removed without significantly impacting the network’s
capacity or dynamics. Our experimental work uses sparse Hopfield networks.
13.4.1.1 Palimpsest Hopfield nets with a modified learning rule
In [SV99] a new learning rule is presented, which both increases the Hopfield network capacity
and turns it into a “palimpsest”, i.e., a network that can continuously learn new patterns, while
forgetting old ones in an orderly fashion.
Using this new training rule, weights are initially set to zero, and updated for each new
pattern p to be learned according to:
13.4 Knowledge Representation via Attractor Neural Networks 257
N∑
h ij = w ik p k
k=1,k≠i,j
∆w ij = 1 n (p ip j − h ij p j − h ji p i )
13.4.2 Knowledge Representation via Cell Assemblies
Hopfield nets and their ilk play a dual role: as computational algorithms, and as conceptual
models of brain function. In CogPrime they are used as inspiration for slightly different, artificial
economics based computational algorithms; but their hypothesized relevance to brain function
is nevertheless of interest in a CogPrime context, as it gives some hints about the potential
connection between low-level neural net mechanics and higher-level cognitive dynamics.
Hopfield nets lead naturally to a hypothesis about neural knowledge representation, which
holds that a distinct mental concept is represented in the brain as either:
1. a set of “cell assemblies”, where each assembly is a network of neurons that are interlinked
in such a way as to fire in a (perhaps nonlinearly) synchronized manner
2. a distinct temporal activation pattern, which may occur in any one (or more) of a particular
set of cell assemblies
For instance, this hypothesis is perfectly coherent if one interprets a “mental concept” as a
SMEPH (defined in Chapter 14) ConceptNode, i.e. a fuzzy set of perceptual stimuli to which
the organism systematically reacts in different ways. Also, although we will focus mainly on
declarative knowledge here, we note that the same basic representational ideas can be applied
to procedural and episodic knowledge: these may be hypothesized to correspond to temporal
activation patterns as characterized above.
In the biology literature, perhaps the best-articulated modern theories championing the cell
assembly view are those of Gunther Palm [Pal82, HAG07] and Susan Greenfield [SF05, CSG07].
Palm focuses on the dynamics of the formation and interaction assemblies of cortical columns.
Greenfield argues that each concept has a core cell assembly, and that when the concept rises
to the focus of attention, it recruits a number of other neurons beyond its core characteristic
assembly into a “transient ensemble.” 1
It’s worth noting that there may be multiple redundant assemblies representing the same
concept – and potentially recruiting similar transient assemblies when highly activated. The
importance of repeated, slightly varied copies of the same subnetwork has been emphasized by
Edelman [Ede93] among other neural theorists.
1 The larger an ensemble is, she suggests, the more vivid it is as a conscious experience; an hypothesis that
accords well with the hypothesis made in [Goe06b] that a more informationally intense pattern corresponds to
a more intensely conscious quale – but we don’t need to digress extensively onto matters of consciousness for
the present purposes.

13.5 Neural Foundations of Learning
Now we move from knowledge representation to learning – which is after all nothing but the
adaptation of represented knowledge based on stimulus, reinforcement and spontaneous activity.
While our focus in this chapter is on representation, it’s not possible for us to make our points
about glocal knowledge representation in neural net type systems without discussing some
aspects of learning in these systems.
13.5.1 Hebbian Learning
The most common and plausible assumption about learning in the brain is that synaptic connections
between neurons are adapted via some variant of Hebbian learning. The original Hebbian
learning rule, proposed by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book [Heb49], was roughly
1. The weight of the synapse x → y increases if x and y fire at roughly the same time
2. The weight of the synapse x → y decreases if x fires at a certain time but y does not
Over the years since Hebb’s original proposal, many neurobiologists have sought evidence that
the brain actually uses such a method. One of the things they have found, so far, is a lot of
evidence for the following learning rule [DC02, LS05]:
1. The weight of the synapse x → y increases if x fires shortly before y does
2. The weight of the synapse x → y decreases if x fires shortly after y does
The new thing here, not foreseen by Donald Hebb, is the “postsynaptic depression” involved in
rule component 2.
Now, the simple rule stated above does not sum up all the research recently done on Hebbiantype
learning mechanisms in the brain. The real biological story underlying these approximate
rules is quite complex, involving many particulars to do with various neurotransmitters. Illunderstood
details aside, however, there is an increasing body of evidence that not only does
this sort of learning occur in the brain, but it leads to distributed experience-based neural
modification: that is, one instance synaptic modification causes another instance of synaptic
modification, which causes another, and so forth 2 [Bi01].
13.5.2 Virtual Synapses and Hebbian Learning Between Assemblies
Hebbian learning is conventionally formulated in terms of individual neurons, but, it can be
extended naturally to assemblies via defining “virtual synapses” between assemblies.
Since assemblies are sets of neurons, one can view a synapse as linking two assemblies
if it links two neurons, each of which is in one of the assemblies. One can then view
two assemblies as being linked by a bundle of synapses. We can define the weight of the
synaptic bundle from assembly A1 to assembly A2 as the number w so that (the change
2 This has been observed in “model systems” consisting of neurons extracted from a brain and hooked together
in a laboratory setting and monitored; measurement of such dynamics in vivo is obviously more difficult.
13.5 Neural Foundations of Learning 259
in the mean activation of A2 that occurs at time t+epsilon) is on average closest to w ×
(the amount of energy flowing through the bundle from A1 to A2 at time t). So when A1 sends
an amount x of energy along the synaptic bundle pointing from A1 to A2, then A2’s mean
activation is on average incremented/decremented by an amount w × x.
In a similar way, one can define the weight of a bundle of synapses between a certain static
or temporal activation-pattern P1 in assembly A1, and another static or temporal activationpattern
P2 in assembly A2. Namely, this may be defined as the number w so that (the amount
of energy flowing through the bundle from A1 to A2 at time t)×w best approximates (the
probability that P2 is present in A2 at time t+epsilon), when averaged over all times t during
which P1 is present in A1.
It is not hard to see that Hebbian learning on real synapses between neurons implies Hebbian
learning on these virtual synapses between cell assemblies and activation-patterns.
These ideas may be developed further to build a connection between neural knowledge representation
and probabilistic logical knowledge representation such as is used in CogPrime’s
Probabilistic Logic Networks formalism; this connection will be pursued at the end of Chapter
34, once more relevant background has been presented.
13.5.3 Neural Darwinism
A notion quite similar to Hebbian learning between assemblies has been pursued by Nobelist
Gerald Edelman in his theory of neuronal group selection, or “Neural Darwinism.” Edelman won
a Nobel Prize for his work in immunology, which, like most modern immunology, was based on
C. MacFarlane Burnet’s theory of “clonal selection” [Bur62], which states that antibody types
in the mammalian immune system evolve by a form of natural selection. From his point of view,
it was only natural to transfer the evolutionary idea from one mammalian body system (the
immune system) to another (the brain).
The starting point of Neural Darwinism is the observation that neuronal dynamics may be
analyzed in terms of the behavior of neuronal groups. The strongest evidence in favor of this
conjecture is physiological: many of the neurons of the neocortex are organized in clusters, each
one containing say 10,000 to 50,000 neurons each. Once one has committed oneself to looking at
such groups, the next step is to ask how these groups are organized, which leads to Edelman’s
concept of “maps.”
A “map,” in Edelman’s terminology, is a connected set of groups with the property that when
one of the inter-group connections in the map is active, others will often tend to be active as
well. Maps are not fixed over the life of an organism. They may be formed and destroyed in
a very simple way: the connection between two neuronal groups may be “strengthened” by increasing
the weights of the neurons connecting the one group with the other, and “weakened” by
decreasing the weights of the neurons connecting the two groups. If we replace “map” with “cell
assembly” we arrive at a concept very similar to the one described in the previous subsection.
Edelman then makes the following hypothesis: the large-scale dynamics of the brain is dominated
by the natural selection of maps. Those maps which are active when good results are
obtained are strengthened, those maps which are active when bad results are obtained are
weakened. And maps are continually mutated by the natural chaos of neural dynamics, thus
providing new fodder for the selection process. By use of computer simulations, Edelman and his
colleagues have shown that formal neural networks obeying this rule can carry out fairly compli-
260 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
cated acts of perception. In general-evolution language, what is posited here is that organisms
like humans contain chemical signals that signify organism-level success of various types, and
that these signals serve as a “fitness function” correlating with evolutionary fitness of neuronal
maps.
In Neural Darwinism and his other related books and papers, Edelman goes far beyond this
crude sketch and presents neuronal group selection as a collection of precise biological hypotheses,
and presents evidence in favor of a number of these hypotheses. However, we consider that
the basic concept of neuronal group selection is largely independent of the biological particularities
in terms of which Edelman has phrased it. We suspect that the mutation and selection of
“transformations” or “maps” is a necessary component of the dynamics of any intelligent system.
As we will see later on (e.g. in Chapter 42 of Part 2, this business of maps is extremely
important to CogPrime. CogPrime does not have simulated biological neurons and synapses,
but it does have Nodes and Links that in some contexts play loosely similar roles. We sometimes
think of CogPrime Nodes and Links as being very roughly analogous to Edelman’s neuronal
clusters, and emergent intercluster links. And we have maps among CogPrime Nodes and Links,
just as Edelman has maps among his neuronal clusters. Maps are not the sole bearers of meaning
in CogPrime, but they are significant ones.
There is a very natural connection between Edelman-style brain evolution and the ideas
about cognitive evolution presented in Chapter 3. Edelman proposes a fairly clear mechanism
via which patterns that survive a while in the brain are differentially likely to survive a long
time: this is basic Hebbian learning, which in Edelman’s picture plays a role between neuronal
groups. And, less directly, Edelman’s perspective also provides a mechanism by which intense
patterns will be differentially selected in the brain: because on the level of neural maps, pattern
intensity corresponds to the combination of compactness and functionality. Among a number
of roughly equally useful maps serving the same function, the more compact one will be more
likely to survive over time, because it is less likely to be disrupted by other brain processes
(such as other neural maps seeking to absorb its component neuronal groups into themselves).
Edelman’s neuroscience remains speculative, since so much remains unknown about human
neural structure and dynamics; but it does provide a tentative and plausible connection between
evolutionary neurodynamics and the more abstract sort of evolution that patternist philosophy
posits to occur in the realm of mind-patterns.
13.6 Glocal Memory
A glocal memory is one that transcends the global/local dichotomy and incorporates both
aspects in a tightly interconnected way. Here we make the glocal memory concept more precise,
and describe its incarnation in the context of attractor neural nets (which is similar to its
incarnation in CogPrime, to be elaborated in later chapters). Though our main interest here is
in glocality in CogPrime, we also suggest that glocality may be a critical property to consider
when analyzing human, animal and AI memory more broadly.
The notion of glocal memory has implicitly occurred in a number of prior brain theories
(without use of the neologism “glocal”), e.g. [Cal96] and [Goe01], but it has not previously been
explicitly developed. However the concept has risen to the fore in our recent AI work and so
we have chosen to flesh it out more fully in [HG08], [GPI + 10] and the present section.
13.6 Glocal Memory 261
Glocal memory overcomes the dichotomy between localized memory (in which each memory
item is stored in a single location within an overall memory structure) and distributed memory
(in which a memory item is stored as an aspect of a multi-component memory system, in such
a way that the same set of multiple components stores a large number of memories). In a glocal
memory system, most memory items are stored both locally and globally, with the property
that eliciting either one of the two records of an item tends to also elicit the other one.
Glocal memory applies to multiple forms of memory; however we will focus largely on perceptual
and declarative memory in our detailed analyses here, so as to conserve space and maintain
simplicity of discussion.
The central idea of glocal memory is that (perceptual, declarative, episodic, procedural,
etc.) items may be stored in memory in the form of paired structures that are called (key,
map) pairs. Of course the idea of a “pair” is abstract, and such pairs may manifest themselves
quite differently in different sorts of memory systems (e.g. brains versus non-neuromorphic AI
systems). The key is a localized version of the item, and records some significant aspects of
the items in a simple and crisp way. The map is a dispersed, distributed version of the item,
which represents the item as a (to some extent, dynamically shifting) combination of fragments
of other items. The map includes the key as a subset; activation of the key generally (but not
necessarily always) causes activation of the map; and changes in the memory item will generally
involve complexly coordinated changes on the key and map level both.
Memory is one area where animal brain architecture differs radically from the von Neumann
architecture underlying nearly all contemporary general-purpose computers. Von Neumann
computers separate memory from processing, whereas in the human brain there is no such
distinction. In fact, it’s arguable that in most cases the brain contains no memory apart from
processing: human memories are generally constructed in the course of remembering [Ros88],
which gives human memory a strong capability for “filling in gaps” of remembered experience
and knowledge; and also causes problems with inaccurate remembering in many contexts
[BF71, RM95] We believe the constructive aspect of memory is largely associated with its
glocality.
The remainder of this section presents a fuller formalization of the glocal memory concept,
which is then taken up further in three later chapters:
• Chapter ?? discusses the potential implementation of glocal memory in the human brain
• Chapter ?? discusses the implementation of glocal memory in attractor neural net systems
• Chapter 23 presents Glocal Economic Attention Networks (ECANs), rough analogues of
glocal Hopfield nets that play a central role in CogPrime.
Our hypothesis of the potential general importance of glocality as a property of memory
systems (beyond just the CogPrime architecture) – remains somewhat speculative. The presence
of glocality in human and animal memory is strongly suggested but not firmly demonstrated by
available neuroscience data; and the general value of glocality in the context of artificial brains
and minds is also not yet demonstrated as the whole field of artificial brain and mind building
remains in its infancy. However, the utility of glocal memory for CogPrime is not tied to this
more general, speculative theme – glocality may be useful in CogPrime even if we’re wrong that
it plays a significant role in the brain and in intelligent systems more broadly.
262 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
13.6.1 A Semi-Formal Model of Glocal Memory
To explain the notion of glocal memory more precisely, we will introduce a simple semi-formal
model of a system S that uses a memory to record information relevant to the actions it
carries out. The overall concept of glocal memory should not be considered as restricted to
this particular model. This model is not intended for maximal generality, but is intended to
encompass a variety of current AI system designs and formal neurological models.
In this model, we will consider S’s memory subsystem as a set of objects we’ll call “tokens,”
embedded in some metric space. The metric in the space, which we will call the “basic distance”
of the memory, generally will not be defined in terms of the semantics of the items stored in the
memory; though it may come to shape these dynamics through the specific architecture and
evolution of the memory. Note that these tokens are not intended as generally being mapped
one-to-one onto meaningful items stored in the memory. The “tokens” are the raw materials
that the memory arranges in various patterns in order to store items.
We assume that each token, at each point in time, may meaningfully be assigned a certain
quantitative “activation level.” Also, tokens may have other numerical or discrete quantities
associated with them, depending on the particular memory architecture. Finally, tokens may
relate other tokens, so that optionally a token may come equipped with an (ordered or unordered)
list of other tokens.
To understand the meaning of the activation levels, one should think about S’s memory
subsystem as being coupled with an action-selection subsystem, that dynamically chooses the
actions to be taken by the overall system in which the two subsystems are embedded. Each
combination of actions, in each particular type of context, will generally be associated with the
activation of certain tokens in memory.
Then, as analysts of the system S, we may associate each token T with an “activation vector”
v(T, t), whose value for each discrete time t consists of the activation of the token T at time t.
So, the 50 ′ th entry of the vector corresponds to the activation of the token at the 50 ′ th time
step.
“Items stored in memory” over a certain period of time, may then be defined as clusters in
the set of activation vectors associated with memory during that period of time. Note that the
system S itself may explicitly recognize and remember patterns regarding what items are stored
in its memory – but, from an external analyst’s perspective, the set of items in S’s memory is
not restricted to the ones that S has explicitly recognized as memory items.
The “localization” of a memory item may be defined as the degree to which the various tokens
involved in the item are close to each other according to the metric in the memory metric-space.
This degree may be formalized in various ways, but choosing a particular quantitative measure
is not important here. A highly localized item may be called “local” and a not-very-localized
item may be called “global.”
We may define the “activation distance” of two tokens as the distance between their activation
vectors. We may then say that a memory is “well aligned” to the extent that there is a correlation
between the activation distance of tokens, and the basic distance of the memory metric-space.
Given the above set-up, the basic notion of glocal memory can be enounced fairly simply. A
glocal memory is one:
• that is reasonably well-aligned (i.e. the correlation between activation and basic distance is
significantly greater than random)
13.6 Glocal Memory 263
• in which most memory items come in pairs, consisting of one local item and one global
item, so that activation of the local item (the “key”) frequently leads in the near future to
activation of the global item (the “map”)
Obviously, in the scope of all possible memory structures constructible within the above
formalism, glocal memories are going to be very rare and special. But, we suggest that they are
important, because they are generally going to be the most effective way for intelligent systems
to structure their memories.
Note also that many memories without glocal structure may be “well-aligned” in the above
sense.
An example of a predominantly local memory structure, in which nearly all significant memory
items are local according to the above definition, is the Cyc logical reasoning engine [LG90].
To cast the Cyc knowledge base in the present formal model, the tokens are logical predicates.
Cyc does not have an in-built notion of activation, but one may conceive the activation of a
logical formula in Cyc as the degree to which the formula is used in reasoning or query processing
during a certain interval in time. And one may define a basic metric for Cyc by associating
a predicate with its extension (the set of satisfying inputs), and defining the similarity of two
predicates as the symmetric distance of their extensions. Cyc is reasonably well-aligned, but
according to the dynamics of its querying and reasoning engines, it is basically a local memory
structure without significant global memory structure.
On the other hand, an example of a predominantly global memory structure, in which nearly
all significant memory items are global according to the above definition, is the Hopfield associative
memory network [Ami89]. Here memories are stored in the pattern of weights associated
with synapses within a network of formal neurons, and each memory in general involves a large
number of the neurons in the network. To cast the Hopfield net in the present formal model, the
tokens are neurons and synapses; the activations are neural net activations; the basic distance
between two neurons A and B may be defined as the percentage of the time that stimulating
one of the neurons leads to the other one firing; and to calculate a basic distance involving a
synapse, one may associate the synapse with its source and target neurons. With these definitions,
a Hopfield network is a well-aligned memory, and (by intentional construction) a markedly
global one. Local memory items will be very rare in a Hopfield net.
While predominantly local and predominantly global memories may have great value for particular
applications, our suggestion is that they also have inherent limitations. If so, this means
that the most useful memories for general intelligence are going to be those that involve both
local and global memory items in central roles. However, this is a more general and less risky
claim than the assertion that glocal memory structure as defined above is important. Because,
“glocal” as defined above doesn’t just mean “neither predominantly global nor predominantly
local.” Rather, it refers to a specific pattern of coordination between local and global memory
items – what we have called the “keys and maps” pattern.
13.6.2 Glocal Memory in the Brain
Science’s understanding of human brain dynamics is still very primitive, one manifestation of
which is the fact that we really don’t understand how the brain represents knowledge, except
in some very simple respects. So anything anyone says about knowledge representation in the
brain, at this stage, has to be considered highly speculative. Existing neuroscience knowledge
264 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
does imply constraints on how knowledge representation in the brain may work, but these are
relatively loose constraints. These constraints do imply that, for instance, the brain is neither a
relational database (in which information is stored in a wholly localized manner) nor a collection
of “grandmother neurons” that respond individually to high-level percepts or concepts; nor a
simple Hopfield type neural net (in which all memories are attractors globally distributed across
the whole network). But they don’t tell us nearly enough to, for instance, create a formal neural
net model that can confidently be said to represent knowledge in the manner of the human brain.
As a first example of the current state of knowledge, we’ll discuss here a series of papers
regarding the neural representation of visual stimuli [QaGKKF05, QKKF08], which deal with
the fascinating discovery of a subset of neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that are
selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects,
and in some cases even by letter strings. For instance, in their 2005 paper titled ”Invariant visual
representation by single neurons in the human brain”, it is noted that
in one case, a unit responded only to three completely different images of the ex-president Bill Clinton.
Another unit (from a different patient) responded only to images of The Beatles, another one to cartoons
from The Simpson’s television series and another one to pictures of the basketball player Michael Jordan.
Their 2008 follow-up paper backed away from the more extreme interpretation in the title as
well as the conclusion, with the title “Sparse but not ‘Grandmother-cell’ coding in the medial
temporal lobe.” As the authors emphasize there,
Given the very sparse and abstract representation of visual information by these neurons, they could in
principle be considered as ‘grandmother cells’. However, we give several arguments that make such an
extreme interpretation unlikely.
. . .
MTL neurons are situated at the juncture of transformation of percepts into constructs that can be
consciously recollected. These cells respond to percepts rather than to the detailed information falling
on the retina. Thus, their activity reflects the full transformation that visual information undergoes
through the ventral pathway. A crucial aspect of this transformation is the complementary development
of both selectivity and invariance. The evidence presented here, obtained from recordings of single-neuron
activity in humans, suggests that a subset of MTL neurons possesses a striking invariant representation
for consciously perceived objects, responding to abstract concepts rather than more basic metric details.
This representation is sparse, in the sense that responsive neurons fire only to very few stimuli (and are
mostly silent except for their preferred stimuli), but it is far from a Grandmother-cell representation.
The fact that the MTL represents conscious abstract information in such a sparse and invariant way is
consistent with its prominent role in the consolidation of long-term semantic memories.
It’s interesting to note how inadequate the [QKKF08] data really is for exploring the notion
of glocal memory in the brain. Suppose it’s the case that individual visual memories correspond
to keys consisting of small neuronal subnetworks, and maps consisting of larger neuronal
subnetworks. Then it would be not at all surprising if neurons in the “key” network corresponding
to a visual concept like “Bill Clinton’s face” would be found to respond differentially
to the presentation of appropriate images. Yet, it would also be wrong to overinterpret such
data as implying that the key network somehow comprises the “representation” of Bill Clinton’s
face in the individual’s brain. In fact this key network would comprise only one aspect of said
representation.
In the glocal memory hypothesis, a visual memory like “Bill Clinton’s face” would be hypothesized
to correspond to an attractor spanning a significant subnetwork of the individual’s brain
13.6 Glocal Memory 265
– but this subnetwork still might occupy only a small fraction of the neurons in the brain (say,
1/100 or less), since there are very many neurons available. This attractor would constitute the
map. But then, there would be a much smaller number of neurons serving as key to unlock
this map: i.e. if a few of these key neurons were stimulated, then the overall attractor pattern
in the map as a whole would unfold and come to play a significant role in the overall brain
activity landscape. In prior publications [Goe97] the primary author explored this hypothesis
in more detail in terms of the known architecture of the cortex and the mathematics of complex
dynamical attractors.
So, one possible interpretation of the [QKKF08] data is that the MTL neurons they’re
measuring are part of key networks that correspond to broader map networks recording percepts.
The map networks might then extend more broadly throughout the brain, beyond the MTL
and into other perceptual and cognitive areas of cortex. Furthermore, in this case, if some MTL
key neurons were removed, the maps might well regenerate the missing keys (as would happen
e.g. in the glocal Hopfield model to be discussed in the following section).
Related and interesting evidence for glocal memory in the brain comes from a recent study of
semantic memory, illustrated in Figure ?? [PNR07]. Their research probed the architecture of
semantic memory via comparing patients suffering from semantic dementia (SD) with patients
suffering from three other neuropathologies, and found reasonably convincing evidence for what
they call a “distributed-plus-hub” view of memory.
The SD patients they studied displayed highly distinctive symptomology; for instance, their
vocabularies and knowledge of the properties of everyday objects were strongly impaired,
whereas their memories of recent events and other cognitive capacities remain perfectly intact.
These patients also showed highly distinctive patterns of brain damage: focal brain lesions
in their anterior temporal lobes (ATL), unlike the other patients who had either less severe or
more widely distributed damage in their ATLs. This led [PNR07] to conclude that the ATL
(being adjacent to the amygdala and limbic systems that process reward and emotion; and the
anterior parts of the medial temporal lobe memory system, which processes episodic memory)
is a “hub” for amodal semantic memory, drawing general semantic information from episodic
memories based on emotional salience.
So, in this view, the memory of something like a “banana” would contain a distributed aspect,
spanning multiple brain systems, and also a localized aspect, centralized in the ATL.
The distributed aspect would likely contain information on various particular aspects of bananas,
including their sights, smells, and touches, the emotions they evoke, and the goals and
motivations they relate to. The distributed and localized aspects would influence one another
dynamically, but, the data [PNR07] gathered do not address dynamics and they don’t venture
hypotheses in this direction.
There is a relationship between the “distributed-plus-hub” view and [Dam00] better-known
notion of a “convergence zone”, defined roughly as a location where the brain binds features together.
A convergence zone, in [Dam00] perspective, is not a “store” of information but an agent
capable of decoding a signal (and of reconstructing information). He also uses the metaphor
that convergence zones behave like indexes drawing information from other areas of the brain –
but they are dynamic rather than static indices, containing the instructions needed to recognize
and combine the features constituting the memory of something. The mechanism involved in
the distributed-plus-hub model is similar to a convergence zone, but with the important difference
that hubs are less local: [PNR07] semantic hub may be thought of a kind of “cluster of
convergence zones” consisting of a network of convergence zones for various semantic memories.
266 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
Fig. 13.1: A Simplified Look at Feedback-Control in Uncertain Inference
What is missing in [PNR07] and [Dam00] perspective is a vision of distributed memories
as attractors. The idea of localized memories serving as indices into distributed knowledge
stores is important, but is only half the picture of glocal memory: the creative, constructive,
dynamical-attractor aspect of the distributed representation is the other half. The closest thing
to a clear depiction of this aspect of glocal memory that seems to exist in the neuroscience
literature is a portion of William Calvin’s theory of the “cerebral code” [Cal96]. Calvin proposes
a set of quite specific mechanisms by which knowledge may be represented in the brain
using complexly-structured strange attractors, and by which these strange attractors may be
propagated throughout the brain. Figure 13.2 shows one aspect of his theory: how a distributed
attractor may propagate from one part of the brain to another in pieces, with one portion of
the attractor getting propagated first, and then seeding the formation in the destination brain
region of a close approximation of the whole attractor.
Calvin’s theory may be considered a genuinely glocal theory of memory. However, it also
makes a large number of other specific commitments that are not part of the notion of glocality,
such as his proposal of hexagonal meta-columns in the cortex, and his commitment to
evolutionary learning as the primary driver of neural knowledge creation. We find these other
13.6 Glocal Memory 267
Fig. 13.2: Calvin’s Model of Distributed Attractors in the Brain
hypotheses interesting and highly promising, yet feel it is also important to separate out the
notion of glocal memory for separate consideration.
Regarding specifics, our suggestion is that Calvin’s approach may overemphasize the distributed
aspect of memory, not giving sufficient due to the relatively localized aspect as accounted
for in the [QKKF08] results discussed above. In Calvin’s glocal approach, global memories
are attractors and local memories are parts of attractors. We suggest a possible alternative,
in which global memories are attractors and local memories are particular neuronal subnetworks
such as the specialized ones identified by [QKKF08]. However, this alternative does not seem
contradictory to Calvin’s overall conceptual approach, even though it is different from the particular
proposals made in [Cal96].
The above paragraphs are far from a complete survey of the relevant neuroscience literature;
there are literally dozens of studies one could survey pointing toward the glocality of various
sorts of human memory. Yet experimental neuroscience tools are still relatively primitive, and
every one of these studies could be interpreted in various other ways. In the next couple decades,
as neuroscience tools improve in accuracy, our understanding of the role of glocality in human
memory will doubtless improve tremendously.
268 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
13.6.3 Glocal Hopfield Networks
The ideas in the previous section suggest that, if one wishes to construct an AGI, it is worth
seriously considering using a memory with some sort of glocal structure. One research direction
that follows naturally from this notion is “glocal neural networks.” In order to explore the nature
of glocal neural networks in a relatively simple and tractable setting, we have formalized and
implemented simple examples of “glocal Hopfield networks”: palimpsest Hopfield nets with the
addition of neurons representing localized memories. While these specific networks are not used
in CogPrime, they are quite similar to the ECAN networks that are used in CogPrime and
described in Chapter 23 of Part 2.
Essentially, we augment the standard Hopfield net architecture by adding a set of “key
neurons.” These are a small percentage of the neurons in the network, and are intended to be
roughly equinumerous to the number of memories the network is supposed to store. When the
Hopfield net converges to an attractor A, then new links are created between the neurons that
are active in A, and one of the key neurons. Which key neuron is chosen? The one that, when
it is stimulated, gives rise to an attractor pattern maximally similar to A.
The ultimate result of this is that, in addition to the distributed memory of attractors in the
Hopfield net, one has a set of key neurons that in effect index the attractors. Each attractor
corresponds to a single key neuron. In the glocal memory model, the key neurons are the keys
and the Hopfield net attractors are the maps.
This algorithm has been tested in sparse Hopfield nets, using both standard Hopfield net
learning rules and Storkey’s modified palimpsest learning rule [SV99], which provides greater
memory capacity in a continuous learning context. The use of key neurons turns out to slightly
increase Hopfield net memory capacity, but this isn’t the main point. The main point is that
one now has a local representation of each global memory, so that if one wants to create a
link between the memory and something else, it’s extremely easy to do so – one just needs
to link to the corresponding key neuron. Or, rather, one of the corresponding key neurons:
depending on how many key neurons are allocated, one might end up with a number of key
neurons corresponding to each memory, not just one.
In order to transform a palimpsest Hopfield net into a glocal Hopfield net, the following steps
are taken:
1. Add a fixed number of “key neurons” to the network (removing other random neurons to
keep the total number of neurons constant)
2. When the network reaches an attractor, create links from the elements in the attractor to
one of the key neurons
3. The key neuron chosen for the previous step is the one that most closely matches the current
attractor (which may be determined in several ways, to be discussed below)
4. To avoid the increase of the number of links in the network, when new links are created in
Step 2, other key-neuron links are then deleted (several approaches may be taken here, but
the simplest is to remove the key-neuron links with the lowest-absolute-value weights)
In the simple implementation of the above steps that we implemented, and described in
[GPI + 10], Step 3 is carried out simply by comparing the weights of a key neuron’s links to the
nodes in an attractor. A more sophisticated approach would be to select the key neuron with
the highest activation during the transient interval immediately prior to convergence to the
attractor.
13.6 Glocal Memory 269
The result of these modifications to the ordinary Hopfield net, is a Hopfield net that continually
maintains a set of key neurons, each of which individually represents a certain attractor
of the net.
Note that these key neurons – in spite of being “symbolic” in nature – are learned rather
than preprogrammed, and are every bit as adaptive as the attractors they correspond to. Furthermore,
if a key neuron is removed, the glocal Hopfield net algorithm will eventually learn it
back, so the robustness properties of Hopfield nets are retained.
The results of experimenting with glocal Hopfield nets of this nature are summarized in
[GPI + 10]. We studied Hopfield nets with connectivity around .1, and in this context we found
that glocality
• slightly increased memory capacity
• massively increased the rate of convergence to the attractor, i.e. the speed of recall
However, probably the most important consequence of glocality is a more qualitative one: it
makes it far easier to link the Hopfield net into a larger system, as would occur if the Hopfield net
were embedded in an integrative AGI architecture. Because a neuron external to the Hopfield
net may now link to a memory in the Hopfield net by linking to the corresponding key neuron.
13.6.4 Neural-Symbolic Glocality in CogPrime
In CogPrime, we have explicitly sought to span the symbolic/emergentist pseudo-dichotomy,
via creating an integrative knowledge representation that combines logic-based aspects with
neural-net-like aspects. As reviewed in Chapter 6 above, these function not in the manner of
multimodular systems, but rather via using (probabilistic) truth values and (attractor neural
net like) attention values as weights on nodes and links of the same (hyper) graph. The nodes
and links in this hypergraph are typed, like a standard semantic network approach for knowledge
representation, so they’re able to handle all sorts of knowledge, from the most concrete
perception and actuation related knowledge to the most abstract relationships. But they’re also
weighted with values similar to neural net weights, and pass around quantities (importance
values, discussed in Chapter 23 of Part 2) similar to neural net activations, allowing emergent
attractor/assembly based knowledge representation similar to attractor neural nets.
The concept of glocality lies at the heart of this combination, in a way that spans the pseudodichotomy:
• Local knowledge is represented in abstract logical relationships stored in explicit logical
form, and also in Hebbian-type associations between nodes and links.
• Global knowledge is represented in large-scale patterns of node and link weights, which
lead to large-scale patterns of network activity, which often take the form of attractors
qualitatively similar to Hopfield net attractors. These attractors are called maps.
The result of all this is that a concept like “cat” might be represented as a combination of:
• A small number of logical relationships and strong associations, that constitute the “key”
subnetwork for the “cat” concept.
• A large network of weak associations, binding together various nodes and links of various
types and various levels of abstraction, representing the “cat map”.
270 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation
The activation of the key will generally cause the activation of the map, and the activation of
a significant percentage of the map will cause the activation of the rest of the map, including the
key. Furthermore, if the key were for some reason forgotten, then after a significant amount of
effort, the system would likely to be able to reconstitute it (perhaps with various small changes)
from the information in the map. We conjecture that this particular kind of glocal memory will
turn out to be very powerful for AGI, due to its ability to combine the strengths of formal
logical inference with those of self-organizing attractor neural networks.
As a simple example, consider the representation of a “tower”, in the context of an artificial
agent that has built towers of blocks, and seen pictures of many other kinds of towers, and seen
some tall building that it knows are somewhat like towers but perhaps not exactly towers. If
this agent is reasonably conceptually advanced (say, at Piagetan the concrete operational level)
then its mind will contain some declarative relationships partially characterizing the concept of
“tower,” as well as its sensory and episodic examples, and its procedural knowledge about how
to build towers.
The key of the “tower” concept in the agent’s mind may consist of internal images and
episodes regarding the towers it knows best, the essential operations it knows are useful for
building towers (piling blocks atop blocks atop blocks...), and the core declarative relations
summarizing “towerness” – and the whole “tower” map then consists of a much larger number
of images, episodes, procedures and declarative relationships connected to “tower” and other
related entities. If any portion of the map is removed – even if the key is removed – then the
rest of the map can be approximately reconstituted, after some work. Some cognitive operations
are best done on the localized representation – e.g. logical reasoning. Other operations, such as
attention allocation and guidance of inference control, are best done using the globalized map
representation.
Chapter 14
Representing Implicit Knowledge via Hypergraphs
14.1 Introduction
Explicit knowledge is easy to write about and talk about; implicit knowledge is equally important,
but tends to get less attention in discussions of AI and psychology, simply because we don’t
have as good a vocabulary for describing it, nor as good a collection of methods for measuring
it. One way to deal with this problem is to describe implicit knowledge using language and
methods typically reserved for explicit knowledge. This might seem intrinsically non-workable,
but we argue that it actually makes a lot of sense. The same sort of networks that a system like
CogPrime uses to represent knowledge explicitly, can also be used to represent the emergent
knowledge that implicitly exists in an intelligent system’s complex structures and dynamics.
We’ve noted that CogPrime uses an explicit representation of knowledge in terms of weighted
labeled hypergraphs; and also uses other more neural net like mechanisms (e.g. the economic
attention allocation network subsystem) to represent knowledge globally and implicitly. Cog-
Prime combines these two sorts of representation according to the principle we have called
glocality. In this chapter we pursue glocality a bit further – describing a means by which even
implicitly represented knowledge can be modeled using weighted labeled hypergraphs similar to
the ones used explicitly in CogPrime. This is conceptually important, in terms of making clear
the fundamental similarities and differences between implicit and explicit knowledge representation;
and it is also pragmatically meaningful due to its relevance to the CogPrime methods
described in Chapter 42 of Part 2 that transform implicit into explicit knowledge.
To avoid confusion with CogPrime’s explicit knowledge representation, we will refer to the
hypergraphs in this chapter as composed of Vertices and Edges rather than Nodes and Links. In
prior publications we have referred to "derived" or "emergent" hypergraphs of the sort described
here using the acronym SMEPH, which stands for Self-Modifying, Evolving Probabilistic Hypergraphs.
14.2 Key Vertex and Edge Types
We begin by introducing a particular collection of Vertex and Edge types, to be used in modeling
the internal structures of intelligent systems.
The key SMEPH Vertex types are
271
272 14 Representing Implicit Knowledge via Hypergraphs
• ConceptVertex, representing a set, for instance, an idea or a set of percepts
• SchemaVertex, representing a procedure for doing something (perhaps something in the
physical world, or perhaps an abstract mental action).
The key SMEPH Edge types, using language drawn from Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN)
and elaborated in Chapter 34 below, are as follows:
• ExtensionalInheritanceEdge (ExtInhEdge for short: an edge which, linking one Vertex or
Edge to another, indicates that the former is a special case of the latter)
• ExtensionalSimilarityEdge (ExtSim: which indicates that one Vertex or Edge is similar to
another)
• ExecutionEdge (a ternary edge, which joins S,B,C when S is a SchemaVertex and the result
from applying S to B is C).
So, in a SMEPH system, one is often looking at hypergraphs whose Vertices represent ideas or
procedures, and whose Edges represent relationships of specialization, similarity or transformation
among ideas and/or procedures.
The semantics of the SMEPH edge types is given by PLN, but is simple and commonsensical.
ExtInh and ExtSim Edges come with probabilistic weights indicating the extent of
the relationship they denote (e.g. the ExtSimEdge joining the cat ConceptVertex to the dog
ConceptVertex gets a higher probability weight than the one joining the cat ConceptVertex
to the washing-machine ConceptVertex). The mathematics of transformations involving these
probabilistic weights becomes quite involved - particularly when one introduces SchemaVertices
corresponding to abstract mathematical operations, a step that enables SMEPH hypergraphs
to have the complete mathematical power of standard logical formalisms like predicate calculus,
but with the added advantage of a natural representation of uncertainty in terms of
probabilities, as well as a natural representation of networks and webs of complex knowledge.
14.3 Derived Hypergraphs
We now describe how SMEPH hypergraphs may be used to model and describe intelligent
systems. One can (in principle) draw a SMEPH hypergraph corresponding to any individual
intelligent system, with Vertices and Edges for the concepts and processes in that system’s
mind. This is called the derived hypergraph of that system.
14.3.1 SMEPH Vertices
A ConceptVertex in the derived hypergraph of a system corresponds to a structural pattern
that persists over time in that system; whereas a SchemaVertex corresponds to a multi-timepoint
dynamical pattern that recurs in that system’s dynamics. If one accepts the patternist
definition of a mind as the set of patterns in an intelligent system, then it follows that the
derived hypergraph of an intelligent system captures a significant fraction of the mind of that
system.
To phrase it a little differently, we may say that a ConceptVertex, in SMEPH, refers to the
habitual pattern of activity observed in a system when some condition is met (this condition
14.3 Derived Hypergraphs 273
corresponding to the presence of a certain pattern). The condition may refer to something in
the world external to the system, or to something internal. For instance, the condition may be
observing a cat. In this case, the corresponding Concept vertex in the mind of Ben Goertzel
is the pattern of activity observed in Ben Goertzel’s brain when his eyes are open and he’s
looking in the direction of a cat. The notion of pattern of activity can be made rigorous using
mathematical pattern theory, as is described in The Hidden Pattern [Goe06a].
Note that logical predicates, on the SMEPH level, appear as particular kinds of Concepts,
where the condition involves a predicate and an argument. For instance, suppose one wants to
know what happens inside Ben’s mind when he eats cheese. Then there is a Concept corresponding
to the condition of cheese-eating activity. But there may also be a Concept corresponding
to eating activity in general. If the Concept denoting the activity of eating X is generally easily
computable from the Concepts for X and eating individually, then the eating Concept is
effectively acting as a predicate.
A SMEPH SchemaVertex, on the other hand, is like a Concept that’s defined in a timedependent
way. One type of Schema refers to a habitual dynamical pattern of activity occurring
before and/or during some condition is met. For instance, the condition might be saying the
word Hello. In that case the corresponding SchemaVertex in the mind of Ben Goertzel is the
pattern of activity that generally occurs before he says Hello.
Another type of Schema refers to a habitual dynamical pattern of activity occurring after
some condition X is met. For instance, in the case of the Schema for adding two numbers, the
precondition X consists of the two numbers and the concept of addition. The Schema is then
what happens when the mind thinks of adding and thinks of two numbers.
Finally, there are Schema that refer to habitual dynamical activity patterns occurring after
some condition X is met and before some condition Y is met. In this case the Schema is viewed
as transforming X into Y. For instance, if X is the condition of meeting someone who is not a
friend, and Y is the condition of being friends with that person, then the habitually intervening
activities constitute the Schema for making friends.
14.3.2 SMEPH Edges
SMEPH edge types fall into two categories: functional and logical. Functional edges connect
Schema vertices to their input and outputs; logical edges refer mainly to conditional probabilities,
and in general are to be interpreted according to the semantics of Probabilistic Logic
Networks.
Let us begin with logical edges. The simplest case is the Subset edge, which denotes a
straightforward, extensional conditional probability. For instance, it may happen that whenever
the Concept for cat is present in a system, the Concept for animal is as well. Then we would
say
Subset cat animal
(Here we assume a notation where “R A B” denotes an Edge of type R between Vertices A and
B.)
On the other hand, it may be that 50% of the time that cat is present in the system, cute is
present as well: then we would say
Subset cat cute <.5>
274 14 Representing Implicit Knowledge via Hypergraphs
where the <.5> denotes the probability, which is a component of the Truth Value associated
with the edge.
Next, the most basic functional edge is the Execution edge, which is ternary and denotes a
relation between a Schema, its input and its output, e.g.
Execution father_of Ben_Goertzel Ted_Goertzel
for a schema father_of that outputs the father of its argument.
The ExecutionOutput (ExOut) edge denotes the output of a Schema in an implicit way, e.g.
ExOut say_hello
refers to a particular act of saying hello, whereas
ExOut add_numbers {3, 4)
refers to the Concept corresponding to 7. Note that this latter example involves a set of three
entities: sets are also part of the basic SMEPH knowledge representation. A set may be thought
of as a hypergraph edge that points to all its members.
In this manner we may define a set of edges and vertices modeling the habitual activity
patterns of a system when in different situations. This is called the derived hypergraph of the
system. Note that this hypergraph can in principle be constructed no matter what happens
inside the system: whether it’s a human brain, a formal neural network, Cyc, OCP, a quantum
computer, etc. Of course, constructing the hypergraph in practice is quite a different story: for
instance, we currently have no accurate way of measuring the habitual activity patterns inside
the human brain. fMRI and PET and other neuroimaging technologies give only a crude view,
though they are continually improving.
Pattern theory enters more deeply here when one thoroughly fleshes out the Inheritance
concept. Philosophers of logic have extensively debated the relationship between extensional
inheritance (inheritance between sets based on their members) and intensional inheritance (inheritance
between entity-types based on their properties). A variety of formal mechanisms have
been proposed to capture this conceptual distinction; see (Wang, 2006, 1995 TODO make ref)
for a review along with a novel approach utilizing uncertain term logic. Pattern theory provides
a novel approach to defining intension: one may associate with each ConceptVertex in a system’s
derived hypergraph the set of patterns associated with the structural pattern underlying that
ConceptVertex. Then, one can define the strength of the IntensionalInheritanceEdge between
two ConceptVertices A and B as the percentage of A’s pattern-set that is also contained in B’s
pattern-set. According to this approach, for instance, one could have
IntInhEdge whale fish <0.6>
ExtInhEdge whale fish <0.0>
since the fish and whale sets have common properties but no common members.
14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs
of Intelligent Systems
Patternist philosophy rears its head here and makes some definite hypotheses about the structure
of derived hypergraphs. It suggests that derived hypergraphs should have a dual network
14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs of Intelligent Systems 275
structure, and that in highly intelligent systems they should have subgraphs that constitute
models of the whole hypergraph (these are self systems). SMEPH does not add anything to
the patternist view on a philosophical level, but it gives a concrete instantiation to some of the
general ideas of patternism. In this section we’ll articulate some "SMEPH principles", constituting
important ideas from patternist philosophy as they manifest themselves in the SMEPH
context.
The logical edges in a SMEPH hypergraph are weighted with probabilities, as in the simple
example given above. The functional edges may be probabilistically weighted as well, since some
Schema may give certain results only some of the time. These probabilities are critical in terms
of SMEPH’s model of system dynamics; they underly one of our SMEPH principles,
Principle of Implicit Probabilistic Inference: In an intelligent system, the temporal
evolution of the probabilities on the edges in the system’s derived hypergraph should approximately
obey the rules of probability theory.
The basic idea is that, even if a system - through its underlying dynamics - has no explicit
connection to probability theory, it still must behave roughly as if it does, if it is going to be
intelligent. The roughly part is important here; it’s well known that humans are not terribly
accurate in explicitly carrying out formal probabilistic inferences. And yet, in practical contexts
where they have experience, humans can make quite accurate judgments; which is all that’s
required by the above principle, since it’s the contexts where experience has occurred that will
make up a system’s derived hypergraph.
Our next SMEPH principle is evolutionary, and states
Principle of Implicit Evolution: In an intelligent system, new Schema and Concepts will
continually be created, and the Schema and Concepts that are more useful for achieving system
goals (as demonstrated via probabilistic implication of goal achievement) will tend to survive
longer.
Note that this principle can be fulfilled in many different ways. The important thing is that
system goals are allowed to serve as a selective force.
Another SMEPH dynamical principle pertains to a shorter time-scale than evolution, and
states
Principle of Attention Allocation: In an intelligent system, Schema and Concepts that
are more useful for attaining short-term goals will tend to consume more of the system’s energy.
(The balance of attention oriented toward goals pertaining to different time scales will vary from
system to system.)
Next, there is the
Principle of Autopoesis: In an intelligent system, if one removes some part of the system
and then allows the system’s natural dynamics to keep going, a decent approximation to that
removed part will often be spontaneously reconstituted.
And there is the
276 14 Representing Implicit Knowledge via Hypergraphs
Cognitive Equation Principle: In an intelligent system, many abstract patterns that are
present in the system at a certain time as patterns among other Schema and Concepts, will at
a near-future time be present in the system as patterns among elementary system components.
The Cognitive Equation Principle, briefly discussed in Chapter 3, basically means that Concepts
and Schema emergent in the system are recognized by the system and then embodied
as elementary items in the system so that patterns among them in their emergent form become,
with the passage of time, patterns among them in their directly-system-embodied form.
This is a natural consequence of the way intelligent systems continually recognize patterns in
themselves.
Note that derived hypergraphs may be constructed corresponding to any complex system
which demonstrates a variety of internal dynamical patterns depending on its situation. However,
if a system is not intelligent, then according to the patternist philosophy evolution of its
derived hypergraph can’t necessarily be expected to follow the above principles.
14.4.1 SMEPH Principles in CogPrime
We now more explicitly elaborate the application of these ideas in the CogPrime context. As
noted above, in addition to explicit knowledge representation in terms of Nodes and Links,
CogPrime also incorporates implicit knowledge representation in the form of what are called
Maps: collections of Nodes and Links that tend to be utilized together within cognitive processes.
These Maps constitute a CogPrime system’s derived hypergraph, which will not be identical
to the hypergraph it uses for explicit knowledge representation. However, an interesting
feedback loop arises here, in that the intelligence’s self-study will generally lead it to recognize
large portions of its derived hypergraph as patterns in itself, and then embody these patterns
within its concretely implemented knowledge hypergraph. This relates to the Cognitive Equation
Principle defined above 3, in which an intelligent system continually recognizes patterns in
itself and embodies these patterns in its own basic structure (so that new patterns may more
easily emerge from them).
Often it happens that a particular CogPrime node will serve as the center of a map, so that
e.g. the Concept Link denoting cat will consist of a number of nodes and links roughly centered
around a ConceptNode that is linked to the WordNode cat. But this is not guaranteed and
some CogPrime maps are more diffuse than this with no particular center.
Somewhat similarly, the key SMEPH dynamics are represented explicitly in CogPrime: probabilistic
reasoning is carried out via explicit application of PLN on the CogPrime hypergraph,
evolutionary learning is carried out via application of the MOSES optimization algorithm, and
attention allocation is carried out via a combination of inference and evolutionary pattern mining.
But the SMEPH dynamics also occur implicitly in CogPrime: emergent maps are reasoned
on probabilistically as an indirect consequence of node-and-link level PLN activity; maps evolve
as a consequence of the coordinated whole of CogPrime dynamics; and attention shifts between
maps according to complex emergent dynamics.
To see the need for maps, consider that even a Node that has a particular meaning attached
to it - like the Iraq Node, say - doesn’t contain much of the meaning of Iraq in it. The meaning
of Iraq lies in the Links attached to this Node, and the Links attached to their Nodes - and
the other Nodes and Links not explicitly represented in the system, which will be created by
14.4 Implications of Patternist Philosophy for Derived Hypergraphs of Intelligent Systems 277
CogPrime’s cognitive algorithms based on the explicitly existent Nodes and Links related to
the Iraq Node.
This halo of Atoms related to the Iraq node is called the Iraq map. In general, some maps
will center around a particular Atom, like this Iraq map, others may not have any particular
identifiable center. CogPrime’s cognitive processes act directly on the level of Nodes and Links,
but they must be analyzed in terms of their impact on maps as well. In SMEPH terms, Cog-
Prime maps may be said to correspond to SMEPH ConceptNodes, and for instance bundles of
Links between the Nodes belonging to a map may correspond to a SMEPH Link between two
ConceptNodes.

Emergent Networks of Intelligence
15.1 Introduction
When one is involved with engineering an AGI system, one thinks a lot about the aspects of
the system one is explicitly building – what are the parts, how they fit together, how to test
they’re properly working, and so forth. And yet, these explicitly engineered aspects are only a
fraction of what’s important in an AGI system. At least as critical are the emergent aspects –
the patterns that emerge once the system is up and running, interacting with the world and
other agents, growing and developing and learning and self-modifying. SMEPH is one toolkit
for describing some of these emergent patterns, but it’s only a start.
In line with these general observations, most of this book will focus on the structures and
processes that we have built, or intend to build, into the CogPrime system. But in a sense, these
structures and processes are not the crux of CogPrime’s intended intelligence. The purpose
of these pre-programmed structures and processes is to give rise to emergent structures and
processes, in the course of CogPrime’s interaction with the world and the other minds within
it. We will return to this theme of emergence at several points in later chapters, e.g. in the
discussion of map formation in Chapter 42 of Part 2.
Given the important of emergent structures – and specifically emergent network structures –
for intelligence, it’s fortunate the scientific community has already generated a lot of knowledge
about complex networks: both networks of physical or software elements, and networks of
organization emergent from complex systems. As most of this knowledge has originated in
fields other than AGI, or in pure mathematics, it tends to require some reinterpretation or
tweaking to achieve maximal applicability in the AGI context; but we believe this effort will
become increasingly worthwhile as the AGI field progresses, because network theory is likely
to be very useful for describing the contents and interactions of AGI systems as they develop
increasing intelligence.
In this brief chapter we specifically focus on the emergence of certain large-scale network
structures in a CogPrime knowledge store, presenting heuristic arguments as to why these
structures can be expected to arise. We also comment on the way in which these emergent
structures are expected to guide cognitive processes, and give rise to emergent cognitive processes.
The following chapter expands on this theme in a particular direction, exploring the
possible emergence of structures characterizing inter-cognitive reflection.
279
280 15 Emergent Networks of Intelligence
15.2 Small World Networks
One simple but potentially useful observation about CogPrime Atomspaces is that they are
generally going to be small world networks [Buc03], rather than random graphs. A small world
network is a graph in which the connectivities of the various nodes display a power law behavior
– so that, loosely speaking, there are a few nodes with very many links, then more nodes with a
modest number of links ... and finally, a huge number of nodes with very few links. This kind of
network occurs in many natural and human systems, including citations among papers, financial
arrangements among banks, links between Web pages and the spread of diseases among people
or animals. In a weighted network like an Atomspace, "small-world-ness" must be defined in a
manner taking the weights into account, and there are several obvious ways to do this. Figure
15.1 depicts a small but prototypical small-worlds network, with a few "hub" nodes possessing
far more neighbors than the others, and then some secondary hubs, etc.
An excellent reference on network theory in general, including but not limited to small world
networks, is Peter Csermely’s Weak Links [Cse06]. Many of the ideas in that work have apparent
OpenCog applications, which are not elaborated here.
Fig. 15.1: A typical, though small-sized, small-worlds network.
One process via which small world networks commonly form is "preferential attachment"
[Bar02]. This occurs in essence when "the rich get richer" – i.e. when nodes in the network
grow new links, in a manner that causes them to preferentially grow links to nodes that already
have more links. It is not hard to see that CogPrime’s ECAN dynamics will naturally lead to
15.3 Dual Network Structure 281
preferential attachment, because Atoms with more links will tend to get more STI, and thus
will tend to get selected by more cognitive processes, which will cause them to grow more
links. For this reason, in most circumstances, a CogPrime system in which most link-building
cognitive processes rely heavily on ECAN to guide their activities will tend to contain a smallworld-network
Atomspace. This is not rigorously guaranteed to be the case for any possible
combination of environment and goals, but it is commonsensically likely to nearly always be
the case.
One consequence of the small worlds structure of the Atomspace is that, in exploring other
properties of the Atom network, it is particularly important to look at the hub nodes. For
instance, if one is studying whether hierarchical and heterarchical subnetworks of the Atomspace
exist, and whether they are well-aligned with each other, it is important to look at hierarchical
and heterarchical connections between hub nodes in particular (and secondary hubs, etc.). A
pattern of hierarchical or dual network connection that only held up among the more sparsely
connected nodes in a small-world network would be a strange thing, and perhaps not that
cognitively useful.
15.3 Dual Network Structure
One of the key theoretical notions in patternist philosophy is that complex cognitive systems
evolve internal dual network structures, comprising superposed, harmonized hierarchical and
heterarchical networks. Now we explore some of the specific CogPrime structures and dynamics
militating in favor of the emergence of dual networks.
15.3.1 Hierarchical Networks
The hierarchical nature of human linguistic concepts is well known, and is illustrated in Figure
15.2 for the commonsense knowledge domain (using a graph drawn from WordNet, a huge concept
hierarchy covering 50K+ English-language concepts), and in Figure 15.4 for a specialized
knowledge subdomain, genetics. Due to this fact, a certain amount of hierarchy can be expected
to emerge in the Atomspace of any linguistically savvy CogPrime, simply due to its modeling
of the linguistic concepts that it hears and reads.
Hierarchy also exists in the natural world apart from language, which is the reason that many
sensorimotor-knowledge-focused AGI systems (e.g. DeSTIN and HTM, mentioned in Chapter
4 above) feature hierarchical structures. In these cases the hierarchies are normally spatiotemporal
in nature - with lower layers containing elements responding to more localized aspects
of the perceptual field, and smaller, more localized groups of actuators. This kind of hierarchy
certainly could emerge in an AGI system, but in CogPrime we have opted for a different route.
If a CogPrime system is hybridized with a hierarchical sensorimotor network like one of those
mentioned above, then the Atoms linked to the nodes in the hierarchical sensorimotor network
will naturally possess hierarchical conceptual relationships, and will thus naturally grow hierarchical
links between them (e.g. InheritanceLinks and IntensionalInheritanceLinks via PLN,
AsymmetricHebbianLinks via ECAN).
282 15 Emergent Networks of Intelligence
Fig. 15.2: A typical, though small, subnetwork of WordNet’s hierarchical network.
Once elements of hierarchical structure exist via the hierarchical structure of language and
physical reality, then a richer and broader hierarchy can be expected to accumulate on top
of it, because importance spreading and inference control will implicitly and automatically be
guided by the existing hierarchy. That is, in the language of Chaotic Logic [Goe94] and patternist
theory, hierarchical structure is an "autopoietic attractor" – once it’s there it will tend to enrich
itself and maintain itself. AsymmetricHebbianLinks arranged in a hierarchy will tend to cause
importance to spread up or down the hierarchy, which will lead other cognitive processes to look
for patterns between Atoms and their hierarchical parents or children, thus potentially building
more hierarchical links. Chains of InheritanceLinks pointing up and down the hierarchy will lead
PLN to search for more hierarchical links – e.g. most simply, A → B → C where C is above
B is above A in the hierarchy, will naturally lead inference to check the viability of A → C
by deduction. There is also the possibility to introduce a special DefaultInheritanceLink, as
discussed in Chapter 34 of Part 2, but this isn’t actually necessary to obtain the inferential
maintenance of a robust hierarchical network.
15.3.2 Associative, Heterarchical Networks
Heterarchy is in essence a simpler structure than hierarchy: it simply refers to a network in
which nodes are linked to other nodes with which they share important relationships. That is,
there should be a tendency that if two nodes are often important in the same contexts or for
15.3 Dual Network Structure 283
Fig. 15.3: A typical, though small, subnetwork of the Gene Ontology’s hierarchical network.
the same purposes, they should be linked together. Portrayals of typical heterarchical linkage
patterns among natural language concepts are given in Figures 15.5 and 15.6. Just for fun,
Figure 15.7 shows one person’s attempt to draw a heterarchical graph of the main concepts
in one of Douglas Hofstadter’s books. Naturally, real concept heterarchies are far more large,
complex and tangled than even this one.
In CogPrime, ECAN enforces heterarchy via building SymmetricHebbianLinks, and PLN
by building SimilarityLinks, IntensionalSimilarityLinks and ExtensionalSimilarityLinks. Furthermore,
these various link types reinforce each other. PLN control is guided by importance
spreading, which follows Hebbian links, so that a heterarchical Hebbian network tends to cause
PLN to explore the formation of links following the same paths as the heterarchical Hebbian-
Links. And importance can spread along logical links as well as explicit Hebbian links, so that
the existence of a heterarchical logical network will tend to cause the formation of additional
heterarchical Hebbian links. Heterarchy reinforces itself in "autopoietic attractor" style even
more simply and directly than heterarchy.
284 15 Emergent Networks of Intelligence
Fig. 15.4: Small-scale portrayal of a portion of the spatiotemporal hierarchy in Jeff Hawkins’
Hierarchical Temporal Memory architecture.
15.3.3 Dual Networks
Finally, if both hierarchical and heterarchical structures exist in an Atomspace, then both ECAN
and PLN will naturally blend them together, because hierarchical and heterarchical links will
feed into their link-creation processes and naturally be combined together to form new links.
This will tend to produce a structure called a dual network, in which a hierarchy exists, along
with a rich network of heterarchical links joining nodes in the hierarchy, with a particular density
of links between nodes on the same hierarchical level. The dual network structure will emerge
without any explicit engineering oriented toward it, simply via the existence of hierarchical
and heterarchical networks, and the propensity of ECAN and PLN to be guided by both the
hierarchical and heterarchical networks. The existence of a natural dual network structure in
both linguistic and sensorimotor data will help the formation process along, and then creative
cognition will enrich the dual network yet further than is directly necessitated by the external
world.
15.3 Dual Network Structure 285
Fig. 15.5: Portions of a conceptual heterarchy centered on specific concepts.
Fig. 15.6: A portion of a conceptual heterarchy, showing the "dangling links" leading this portion
to the rest of the heterarchy.
A rigorous mathematical analysis of the formation of hierarchical, heterarchical and dual
networks in CogPrime systems has not yet been undertaken, and would certainly be an interesting
enterprise. Similar to the theory of small world networks, there is ample ground here
for both theorem-proving and heuristic experimentation. However, the qualitative points made
here are sufficiently well-grounded in intuition and experience to be of some use guiding our

Hofstadter’s writings.
ongoing work. One of the nice things about emergent network structures is that they are relatively
straightforward to observe in an evolving, learning AGI system, via visualization and
inspection of structures such at the Atomspace.

A Path to Human-Level AGI

Chapter 16
AGI Preschool
Co-authored with Stephan Vladimir Bugaj
16.1 Introduction
In conversations with government funding sources or narrow AI researchers about AGI work, one
of the topics that comes up most often is that of “evaluation and metrics” – i.e., AGI intelligence
testing. We actually prefer to separate this into two topics: environments and methods for careful
qualitative evaluation of AGI systems, versus metrics for precise measurement of AGI systems.
The difficulty of formulating bulletproof metrics for partial progress toward advanced AGI
has become evident throughout the field, and in Chapter 8 we have elaborated one plausible
explanation for this phenomenon, the "trickiness" of cognitive synergy. [LWML09], summarizing
a workshop on “Evaluation and Metrics for Human-Level AI” held in 2008, discusses some of
the general difficulties involved in this type of assessment, and some requirements that any
viable approach must fulfill. On the other hand, the lack of appropriate methods for careful
qualitative evaluation of AGI systems has been much less discussed, but we consider it actually
a more important issue – as well as an easier (though not easy) one to solve.
We haven’t actually found the lack of quantitative intelligence metrics to be a major obstacle
in our practical AGI work so far. Our OpenCogPrime implementation lags far behind the
CogPrime design as articulated in Part 2 of this book, and according to the theory underlying
CogPrime, the more interesting behaviors and dynamics of the system will occur only when all
the parts of the system have been engineered to a reasonable level of completion and integrated
together. So, the lack of a great set of metrics for evaluating the intelligence of our partiallybuilt
system hasn’t impaired too much. Testing the intelligence of the current OpenCogPrime
system is a bit like testing the flight capability of a partly-built airplane that only has stubs
for wings, lacks tail-fins, has a much less efficient engine than the one that’s been designed for
use in the first "real" version of the airplane, etc. There may be something to be learned from
such preliminary tests, but making them highly rigorous isn’t a great use of effort, compared
to working on finishing implementing the design according to the underlying theory.
On the other hand, the problem of what environments and methods to use to qualitatively
evaluate and study AGI progress, has been considerably more vexing to us in practice, as
we’ve proceeded in our work on implementing and testing OpenCogPrime and developing the
CogPrime theory. When developing a complex system, it’s nearly always valuable to see what
this system does in some fairly rich, complex situations, in order to gain a better intuitive
understanding of the parts and how they work together. In the context of human-level AGI, the
theoretically best way to do this would be to embody one’s AGI system in a humanlike body
289
290 16 AGI Preschool
and set it loose in the everyday human world; but of course, this isn’t feasible given the current
state of development of robotics technology. So one must seek approximations. Toward this end
we have embodied OpenCogPrime in non-player characters in video game style virtual worlds,
and carried out preliminary experiments embodying OpenCogPrime in humanoid robots. These
are reasonably good options but they have limitations and lead to subtle choices: what kind of
game characters and game worlds, what kind of robot environments, etc.?
One conclusion we have come to, based largely on the considerations in Chapter 11 on
development and Chapter 9 on the importance of environment, is that it may make sense to
embed early-stage proto-AGI and AGI systems in environments reminiscent of those used for
teaching young human children. In this chapter we will explore this approach in some detail:
emulation, in either physical reality or an multiuser online virtual world, of an environment
similar to preschools used in early human childhood education. Complete specification of an
“AGI Preschool” would require much more than a brief chapter; our goal here is to sketch the
idea in broad outline, and give a few examples of the types of opportunities such an environment
would afford for instruction, spontaneous learning and formal and informal evaluation of certain
sorts of early-stage AGI systems.
The material in this chapter will pop up fairly often later in the book. The AGI Preschool
context will serve, throughout the following chapters, as a source of concrete examples of the
various algorithms and structures. But it’s not proposed merely as an expository tool; we are
making the very serious proposal that sending AGI systems to a virtual or robotic preschool is
an excellent way – perhaps the best way – to foster the development of human-level human-like
AGI.
16.1.1 Contrast to Standard AI Evaluation Methodologies
The reader steeped in the current AI literature may wonder why it’s necessary to introduce a
new methodology and environment for evaluating AGI systems. There are already very many
different ways of evaluating AI systems out there ... do we really need another?
Certainly, the AI field has inspired many competitions, each of which tests some particular
type or aspect of intelligent behavior. Examples include robot competitions, tournaments of
computer chess, poker, backgammon and so forth at computer olympiads, trading-agent competition,
language and reasoning competitions like the Pascal Textual Entailment Challenge, and
so on. In addition to these, there are many standard domains and problems used in the AI literature
that are meant to capture the essential difficulties in a certain class of learning problems:
standard datasets for face recognition, text parsing, supervised classification, theorem-proving,
question-answering and so forth.
However, the value of these sorts of tests for AGI is predicated on the hypothesis that the
degree of success of an AI program at carrying out some domain-specific task, is correlated
with the potential of that program for being developed into a robust AGI program with broad
intelligence. If humanlike AGI and problem-area-specific “narrow AI” are in fact very different
sorts of pursuits requiring very different principles, as we suspect, then these tests are not
strongly relevant to the AGI problem.
There are also some standard evaluation paradigms aimed at AI going beyond specific tasks.
For instance, there is a literature on “multitask learning" and “transfer learning,” where the
goal for an AI is to learn one task quicker given another task solved previously [Car97, TM95,
16.2 Elements of Preschool Design 291
BDS03, TS07, RZDK05]. This is one of the capabilities an AI agent will need to simultaneously
learn different types of tasks as proposed in the Preschool scenario given here. And there is
a literature on “shaping,” where the idea is to build up the capability of an AI by training
it on progressively more difficult versions of the same tasks [LD03]. Again, this is one sort of
capability an AI will need to possess if it is to move up some type of curriculum, such as a
school curriculum.
While we applaud the work done on multitask learning and shaping, we feel that exploring
these processes using mathematical abstractions, or in the domain of various narrowlyproscribed
machine-learning or robotics test problems, may not adequately address the problem
of AGI. The problem is that generalization among tasks, or from simpler to more difficult
versions of the same task, is a process whose nature may depend strongly on the overall nature
of the set of tasks and task-versions involved. Real-world tasks have a subtlety of interconnectedness
and developmental course that is not captured in current mathematical learning
frameworks nor standard AI test problems.
To put it mathematically, we suggest that the universe of real-world human tasks has a host
of “special statistical properties” that have implications regarding what sorts of AI programs
will be most suitable; and that, while exploring and formalizing the nature of these statistical
properties is important, an easier and more reliable approach to AGI testing is to create a
testing environment that embodies these properties implicitly, via its being an emulation of the
cognitively meaningful aspects of the real-world human learning environment.
One way to see this point vividly is to contrast the current proposal with the “General Game
Player” AI competition, in which AIs seek to learn to play games based on formal descriptions
of the rules. 1 . Clearly doing GGP well requires powerful AGI; and doing GGP even mediocrely
probably requires robust multitask learning and shaping. But we suspect GGP is far inferior to
AGI Preschool as an approach to testing early-stage AI programs aimed at roughly humanlike
intelligence. This is because, unlike the tasks involved in AI Preschool, the tasks involved in
doing simple instances of GGP seem to have little relationship to humanlike intelligence or
real-world human tasks.
16.2 Elements of Preschool Design
What we mean by an “AGI Preschool” is simply a porting to the AGI domain of the essential
aspects of human preschools. While there is significant variance among preschools there are also
strong commonalities, grounded in educational theory and experience. We will briefly discuss
both the physical design and educational curriculum of the typical human preschool, and which
aspects transfer effectively to the AGI context.
On the physical side, the key notion in modern preschool design is the “learning center,” an
area designed and outfitted with appropriate materials for teaching a specific skill. Learning
centers are designed to encourage learning by doing, which greatly facilitates learning processes
based on reinforcement, imitation and correction (see Chapter 31 of Part 2 for a detailed discussion
of the value of this combination); and also to provide multiple techniques for teaching
the same skills, to accommodate different learning styles and prevent over-fitting and overspecialization
in the learning of new skills.
1 http://games.stanford.edu/
292 16 AGI Preschool
Centers are also designed to cross-develop related skills. A “manipulatives center,” for example,
provides physical objects such as drawing implements, toys and puzzles, to facilitate
development of motor manipulation, visual discrimination, and (through sequencing and classification
games) basic logical reasoning. A “dramatics center,” on the other hand, cross-trains
interpersonal and empathetic skills along with bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, and musical skills.
Other centers, such as art, reading, writing, science and math centers are also designed to train
not just one area, but to center around a primary intelligence type while also cross-developing
related areas. For specific examples of the learning centers associated with particular contemporary
preschools, see [Nie98].
In many progressive, student-centered preschools, students are left largely to their own devices
to move from one center to another throughout the preschool room. Generally, each center
will be staffed by an instructor at some points in the day but not others, providing a variety
of learning experiences. At some preschools students will be strongly encouraged to distribute
their time relatively evenly among the different learning centers, or to focus on those learning
centers corresponding to their particular strengths and/or weaknesses.
To imitate the general character of a human preschool, one would create several centers in
a robot lab or virtual world. The precise architecture will best be adapted via experience but
initial centers would likely be:
• a blocks center: a table with blocks on it
• a language center: a circle of chairs, intended for people to sit around and talk with the
robot
• a manipulatives center: with a variety of different objects of different shapes and sizes,
intended to teach visual and motor skills
• a ball play center: where balls are kept in chests and there is space for the robot to kick
the balls around
• a dramatics center: where the robot can observe and enact various movements
16.3 Elements of Preschool Curriculum
While preschool curricula vary considerably based on educational philosophy and regional and
cultural factors, there is a great deal of common, shared wisdom regarding the most useful topics
and methods for preschool teaching. Guided experiential learning in diverse environments and
using varied materials is generally agreed upon as being an optimal methodology to reach a wide
variety of learning types and capabilities. Hands-on learning provides grounding in specifics,
where as a diversity of approaches allows for generalization.
Core knowledge domains are also relatively consistent, even across various philosophies
and regions. Language, movement and coordination, autonomous judgment, social skills, work
habits, temporal orientation, spatial orientation, mathematics, science, music, visual arts, and
dramatics are universal areas of learning which all early childhood learning touches upon. The
particulars of these skills may vary, but all human children are taught to function in these domains.
The level of competency developed may vary, but general domain knowledge is provided.
For example, most kids won’t be the next Maria Callas, Ravi Shankar or Gene Ween, but nearly
all learn to hear, understand and appreciate music.

Comparing Table 16.1 to Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences (MI) framework briefly reviewed in

Preschool curriculum as standardly practiced is very well attuned to MI, and naturally covers

Gardner’s key motivations in articulating MI theory was the pragmatics of educating humans
with diverse strengths and weaknesses.

as microcosms of the most important aspects of the environments faced by humans in their
everyday lives.
16.4 Task-Based Assessment in AGI Preschool 295
16.4 Task-Based Assessment in AGI Preschool
Professional pedagogues such as [CM07] discuss evaluation of early childhood learning as intended
to assess both specific curriculum content knowledge as well as the child’s learning
process. It should be as unobtrusive as possible, so that it just seems like another engaging activity,
and the results used to tailor the teaching regimen to use different techniques to address
weaknesses and reinforce strengths.
For example, with group building of a model car, students are tested on a variety of skills:
procedural understanding, visual acuity, motor acuity, creative problem solving, interpersonal
communications, empathy, patience, manners, and so on. With this kind of complex, yet engaging,
activity as a metric the teacher can see how each student approaches the process of
understanding each subtask, and subsequently guide each student’s focus differently depending
on strengths and weaknesses.
In Tables 16.4 and 16.5 we describe some particular tasks that AGIs may be meaningfully
assigned in the context of a general AGI Preschool design and curriculum as described above.
Of course, this is a very partial list, and is intended as evocative rather than comprehensive.
Any one of these tasks can be turned into a rigorous quantitative test, thus allowing the
precise comparison of different AGI systems’ capabilities; but we have chosen not to emphasize
this point here, partly for space reasons and partly for philosophical ones. In some contexts
the quantitative comparison of different systems may be the right thing to do, but as discussed
in Chapter 17 there are also risks associated with this approach, including the emergence of
an overly metrics-focused “bakeoff mentality” among system developers, and overfitting of AI
abilities to test taking. What is most important is the isolation of specific tasks on which
different systems may be experientially trained and then qualitatively assessed and compared,
rather than the evaluation of quantitative metrics.
Task-oriented testing allows for feedback on applications of general pedagogical principles to
real-world, embodied activities. This allows for iterative refinement based learning (shaping),
and cross development of knowledge acquisition and application (multitask learning). It also
helps militate against both cheating, and over-fitting, as teachers can make ad-hoc modifications
to the tests to determine if this is happening and correct for it if necessary.
E.g., consider a linguistic task in which the AGI is required to formulate a set of instructions
encapsulating a given behavior (which may include components that are physical, social,
linguistic, etc.). Note that although this is presented as centrally a linguistic task, it actually involves
a diverse set of competencies since the behavior to be described may encompass multiple
real-world aspects.
To turn this task into a more thorough test one might involve a number of human teachers
and a number of human students. Before the test, an ensemble of copies of the AGI would
be created, with identical knowledge state. Each copy would interact with a different human
teacher, who would demonstrate to it a certain behavior. After testing the AGI on its own
knowledge of the material, the teacher would then inform the AGI that it will then be tested on
its ability to verbally describe this behavior to another. Then, the teacher goes away and the
copy interacts with a series of students, attempting to convey to the students the instructions
given by the teacher.
The teacher can thereby assess both the AGI’s understanding of the material, and the ability
to explain it to the other students. This separates out assessment of understanding from assessment
of ability to communicate understanding, attempting to avoid conflation of one with the
other. The design of the training and testing needs to account for potential

Table 16.4: Prototypical preschool intelligence assessment tasks, Part 1
This testing protocol abstracts away from the particularities of any one teacher or student,
and focuses on effectiveness of communication in a human context rather than according to
formalized criteria. This is very much in the spirit of how assessment takes place in human
preschools (with the exception of the copying aspect): formal exams are rarely given in preschool,
but pragmatic, socially-embedded assessments are regularly made.
By including the copying aspect, more rigorous statistical assessments can be made regarding
efficacy of different approaches for a given AGI design, independent of past teaching experiences.
The multiple copies may, depending on the AGI system design, then be able to be reintegrated,
and further “learning” be done by higher-order cognitive systems in the AGI that integrate the
disparate experiences of the multiple copies.
This kind of parallel learning is different from both sequential learning that humans do, and
parallel presences of a single copy of an AGI (such as in multiple chat rooms type experiments).
All three approaches are worthy of study, to determine under what circumstances, and with
which AGI designs, one is more successful than another.
It is also worth observing how this test could be tweaked to yield a test of generalization
ability. After passing the above, the AGI could then be given a description of a new task

(acquisition), and asked to explain the new one (variation). And, part of the training behavior
might be carried out unobserved by the AGI, thus requiring the AGI to infer the omitted parts
of the task it needs to describe.
Another popular form of early childhood testing is puzzle block games. These kinds of games
can be used to assess a variety of important cognitive skills, and to do so in a fun way that
not only examines but also encourages creativity and flexible thinking. Types of games include
pattern matching games in which students replicate patterns described visually or verbally,
pattern creation games in which students create new patterns guided by visually or verbally
described principles, creative interpretation of patterns in which students find meaning in the
forms, and free-form creation. Such games may be individual or cooperative.
Cross training and assessment of a variety of skills occurs with pattern block games: for
example, interpretation of visual or linguistic instructions, logical procedure and pattern following,
categorizing, sorting, general problem solving, creative interpretation, experimentation,
and kinematic acuity. By making the games cooperative, various interpersonal skills involving
communication and cooperation are also added to the mix.
The puzzle block context bring up some general observations about the role of kinematic
and visuospatial intelligence in the AGI Preschool. Outside of robotics and computer vision, AI
research has often downplayed these sorts of intelligence (though, admittedly, this is changing in
recent years, e.g. with increasing research focus on diagrammatic reasoning). But these abilities
are not only necessary to navigate real (or virtual) spatial environments. They are also important
components of a coherent, conceptually well-formed understanding of the world in which the
student is embodied. Integrative training and assessment of both rigorous cognitive abilities
generally most associated with both AI and “proper schooling” (such as linguistic and logical
skills) along with kinematic and aesthetic/sensory abilities is essential to the development of
an intelligence that can successfully both operate in and sensibly communicate about the real
world in a roughly humanlike manner. Whether or not an AGI is targeted to interpret physicalworld
spatial data and perform tasks via robotics, in order to communicate ideas about a vast
array of topics of interest to any intelligence in this world, an AGI must develop aspects of
intelligence other than logical and linguistic cognition.

16.5 Beyond Preschool
Once an AGI passes preschool, what are the next steps? There is still a long way to go, from
preschool to an AGI system that is capable of, say, passing the Turing Test or serving as an
effective artificial scientist.
Our suggestion is to extend the school metaphor further, and make use of existing curricula
for higher levels of virtual education: grade school, secondary school, and all levels of postsecondary
education. If an AGI can pass online primary and secondary schools such as e-
tutor.com, and go on to earn an online degree from an accredited university, then clearly said
AGI has successfully achieved “human level, roughly humanlike AGI.” This sort of testing is
interesting not only because it allows assessment of stages intermediate between preschool and
adult, but also because it tests humanlike intelligence without requiring precise imitation of
human behavior.
If an AI can get a BA degree at an accredited university, via online coursework (assuming
for simplicity courses where no voice interaction is needed), then we should consider that AI to
have human-level intelligence. University coursework spans multiple disciplines, and the details
of the homework assignments and exams are not known in advance, so like a human student
the AGI team can’t cheat.
In addition to the core coursework, a schooling approach also tests basic social interaction
and natural language communication, ability to do online research, and general problem solving
ability. However, there is no rigid requirement to be strictly humanlike in order to pass university
classes.
Most of our concrete examples in the following chapters will pertain to the preschool context,
because it’s simple to understand, and because we feel that getting to the “AGI preschool
student” level is going to be the largest leap. Once that level is obtained, moving further
will likely be difficult also, but we suspect it will be more a matter of steady incremental
improvements – whereas the achievement of preschool-level functionality will be a large leap
from the current situation.
16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering
As noted above there are two broad approaches to realizing the “AGI Preschool” idea: using
the AGI to control a physical robot and then crafting a preschool environment suitable to the
robot’s sensors and actuators; or, using the AGI to control a virtual agent in an appropriately
rich virtual-world preschool. The robotic approach is harder from an AI perspective (as one must
deal with problems of sensation and actuation), but easier from an environment-construction
perspective. In the virtual world case, one quickly runs up against the current limitations
of virtual world technologies, which have been designed mainly for entertainment or socialnetworking
purposes, not with the requirements of AGI systems in mind.
In Chapter 9 we discussed the general requirements that an environment should possess to be
supportive of humanlike intelligence. Referring back to that list, it’s clear that current virtual
worlds are fairly strong on multimodal communication, and fairly weak on naive physics. More
concretely, if one wants a virtual world so that
16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering 299
1. one could carry out all the standard cognitive development experiments described in developmental
psychology books
2. one could implement intuitively reasonable versions of all the standard activities in all the
standard learning stations in a contemporary preschool
then current virtual world technologies appear not to suffice.
As reviewed above, typical preschool activities include for instance building with blocks,
playing with clay, looking in a group at a picture book and hearing it read aloud, mixing
ingredients together, rolling/throwing/catching balls, playing games like tag, hide-and-seek,
Simon Says or Follow the Leader, measuring objects, cutting paper into different shapes, drawing
and coloring, etc.
And, as typical, not necessarily representative examples of tasks psychologists use to measure
cognitive development (drawn mainly from the Piagetan tradition, without implying any
assertion that this is the only tradition worth pursuing), consider the following:
1. Which row has more circles- A or B? A: O O O O O, B: OOOOO
2. If Mike is taller than Jim, and Jim is shorter than Dan, then who is the shortest? Who is
the tallest?
3. Which is heavier- a pound of feathers or a pound of rocks?
4. Eight ounces of water is poured into a glass that looks like the fat glass in Figure 2 16.1
and then the same amount is poured into a glass that looks like the tall glass in Figure 16.2
. Which glass has more water?
5. A lump of clay is rolled into a snake. All the clay is used to make the snake. Which has
more clay in it – the lump or the snake?
6. There are two dolls in a room, Sally and Ann, each of which has her own box, with a marble
hidden inside. Sally goes out for a minute, leaving her box behind; and Ann decides to play
a trick on Sally: she opens Sally’s box, removes the marble, hiding it in her own box. Sally
returns, unaware of what happened. Where will Sally would look for her marble?
7. Consider this rule about a set of cards that have letters on one side and numbers on the
other: “If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other side.” If
you have 4 cards labeled “E K 4 7”, which cards do you need to turn over to tell if this rule
is actually true?
8. Design an experiment to figure out how to make a pendulum that swings more slowly versus
less slowly
What we see from this ad hoc, partial list is that a lot of naive physics is required to make an
even vaguely realistic preschool. A lot of preschool education is about the intersection between
abstract cognition and naive physics. A more careful review of the various tasks involved in
preschool education bears out this conclusion.
With this in mind, in this section we will briefly describe an approach to extending current
virtual world technologies that appears to allow the construction of a reasonably rich and
realistic AGI preschool environment, without requiring anywhere near a complete simulation of
realistic physics.

16.6.1 Integrating Virtual Worlds with Robot Simulators
One glaring deficit in current virtual world platforms is the lack of flexibility in terms of tool use.
In most of these systems today, an avatar can pick up or utilize an object, or two objects can
interact, only in specific, pre-programmed ways. For instance, an avatar might be able to pick up
a virtual screwdriver only by the handle, rather than by pinching the blade betwen its fingers.
This places severe limits on creative use of tools, which is absolutely critical in a preschool
context. The solution to this problem is clear: adapt existing generalized physics engines to
mediate avatar-object and object-object interactions. This would require more computation
than current approaches, but not more than is feasible in a research context.
One way to achieve this goal would be to integrate a robot simulator with a virtual world
or game engine, for instance to modify the OpenSim (opensimulator.org) virtual world to
use the Gazebo (playerstage.sourceforge.net) robot simulator in place of its current
physics engine. While tractable, such a project would require considerable software engineering
effort.
16.6.2 BlocksNBeads World
Another glaring deficit in current virtual world platforms is their inability to model physical
phenomena besides rigid objects with any sophistication. In this section we propose a potential
302 16 AGI Preschool
solution to this issue: a novel class of virtual worlds called BlocksNBeadsWorld, consisting of
the following aspects:
1. 3D blocks of various shapes and sizes and frictional coefficients, that can be stacked
2. Adhesive that can be used to stick blocks together, and that comes in two types, one of
which can be removed by an adhesive-removing substance, one of which cannot (though its
bonds can be broken via sufficient application of force)
3. Spherical beads, each of which has intrinsic unchangeable adhesion properties defined according
to a particular, simple “adhesion logic”
4. Each block, and each bead, may be associated with multidimensional quantities representing
its taste and smell; and may be associated with a set of sounds that are made when it is
impacted with various forces at various positions on its surface
Interaction between blocks and beads is to be calculated according to standard Newtonian
physics, which would be compute-intensive in the case of a large number of beads, but tractable
using distributed processing. For instance if 10K beads were used to cover a humanoid agent’s
face, this would provide a fairly wide diversity of facial expressions; and if 10K beads were
used to form a blanket laid on a bed, this would provide a significant amount of flexibility
in terms of rippling, folding and so forth. Yet, this order of magnitude of interactions is very
small compared to what is done in contemporary simulations of fluid dynamics or, say, quantum
chromodynamics.
One key aspect of the spherical beads is that they can be used to create a variety of rigid or
flexible surfaces, which may exist on their own or be attached to blocks-based constructs. The
specific inter-bead adhesion properties of the beads could be defined in various ways, and will
surely need to be refined via experimentation, but a simple scheme that seems to make sense
is as follows.
Each bead can have its surface tesselated into hexagons (the number of these can be tuned),
and within each hexagon it can have two different adhesion coefficients: one for adhesion to
other beads, and one for adhesion to blocks. The adhesion between two beads along a certain
hexagon is then determined by their two adhesion coefficients; and the adhesion between a bead
and a block is determined by the adhesion coefficient of the bead, and the adhesion coefficient
of the adhesive applied to the block. A distinction must be drawn between rigid and flexible
adhesion: rigid adhesion sticks a bead to something in a way that can’t be removed except via
breaking it off; whereas flexible adhesion just keeps a bead very close to the thing it’s stuck
onto. Any two entities may be stuck together either rigidly or flexibly. Sets of beads with flexible
adhesion to each other can be used to make entities like strings, blankets or clothes.
Using the above adhesion logic, it seems one could build a wide variety of flexible structures
using beads, such as (to give a very partial list):
1. fabrics with various textures, that can be draped over blocks structures,
2. multilayered coatings to be attached to blocks structures, serving (among many other examples)
as facial expressions
3. liquid-type substances with varying viscosities, that can be poured between different containers,
spilled, spread, etc.
4. strings tyable in knots; rubber bands that can be stretched; etc.
Of course there are various additional features one could add. For instance one could add a
special set of rules for vibrating strings, allowing BlocksNBeadsWorld to incorporate the creation
16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering 303
of primitive musical instruments. Variations like this could be helpful but aren’t necessary for
the world to serve its essential purpose.
Note that one does not have true fluid dynamics in BlocksNBeadsWorld, but, it seems that
the latter is not necessary to encompass the phenomena covered in cognitive developmental
tests or preschool tasks. The tests and tasks that are done with fluids can instead be done with
masses of beads. For example, consider the conservation of volume task shown in Figures 16.1
and 16.2 below: it’s easy enough to envision this being done with beads rather than milk. Even
a few hundred beads is enough to be psychologically perceived as a mass rather than a set
of discrete units, and to be manipulated and analyzed as such. And the simplification of not
requiring fluid mechanics in one’s virtual world is immense.
Next, one can implement equations via which the adhesion coefficients of a bead are determined
in part by the adhesion coefficients of nearby beads, or beads that are nearby in certain
directions (with direction calculated in local spherical coordinates). This will allow for complex
cracking and bending behaviors – not identical to those in the real world, but with similar qualitative
characteristics. For example, without this feature one could create paperlike substances
that could be cut with scissors – but with this feature, one could go further and create woodlike
substances that would crack when nails were hammered into them in certain ways, and so forth.
Further refinements are certainly possible also. One could add multidimensional adhesion
coefficients, allowing more complex sorts of substances. One could allow beads to vibrate at
various frequencies, which would lead to all sorts of complex wave patterns in bead compounds.
Etc. In each case, the question to be asked is: what important cognitive abilities are dramatically
more easily learnable in the presence of the new feature than in its absence?
The combination of blocks and beads seems ideal for implementing a more flexible and AGIfriendly
type of virtual body than is currently used in games and virtual worlds. One can easily
envision implementing a body with
1. a skeleton whose bones consist of appropriately shaped blocks
2. joints consisting of beads, flexibly adhered to the bones
3. flesh consisting of beads, flexibly adhered to each other
4. internal “plumbing” consisting of tubes whose walls are beads rigidly adhered to each other,
and flexibly adhered to the surrounding flesh (the plumbing could then serve to pass beads
through, where slow passage would be ensured by weak adhesion between the walls of the
tubes and the beads passing through the tubes)
This sort of body would support rich kinesthesia; and rich, broad analogy-drawing between
the internally-experienced body and the externally-experienced world. It would also afford many
interesting opportunities for flexible movement control. Virtual animals could be created along
with virtual humanoids.
Regarding the extended mind, it seems clear that blocks and beads are adequate for the
creation of a variety of different tools. Equipping agents with “glue guns” able to affect the
adhesive properties of both blocks and beads would allow a diversity of building activity; and
building with masses of beads could become a highly creative activity. Furthermore, beads
with appropriately specified adhesion (within the framework outlined above) could be used
to form organically growing plant-like substances, based on the general principles used in L-
system models of plant growth (Prusinciewicz and Lindenmayer 1991). Structures with only
beads would vaguely resemble herbaceous plants; and structures involving both blocks and
beads would more resemble woody plants. One could even make organic structures that flourish
304 16 AGI Preschool
or otherwise based on the light available to them (without of course trying to simulate the
chemistry of photosynthesis).
Some elements of chemistry may be achieved as well, though nowhere near what exists
in physical reality. For instance, melting and boiling at least should be doable: assign every
bead a temperature, and let solid interbead bonds turn liquid above a certain temperature and
disappear completely above some higher temperature. You could even have a simple form of fire.
Let fire be an element, whose beads have negative gravitational mass. Beads of fuel elements
like wood have a threshold temperature above which they will turn into fire beads, with release
of additional heat. 2
The philosophy underlying these suggested bead dynamics is somewhat comparable to that
outlined in Wolfram’s book A New Kind of Science [Wol02]. There he proposes cellular automata
models that emulate the qualitative characteristics of various real-world phenomena,
without trying to match real-world data precisely. For instance, some of his cellular automata
demonstrate phenomena very similar to turbulent fluid flow, without implementing the Navier-
Stokes equations of fluid dynamics or trying to precisely match data from real-world turbulence.
Similarly, the beads in BlocksNBeadsWorld are intended to qualitatively demonstrate the realworld
phenomena most useful for the development of humanlike embodied intelligence, without
trying to precisely emulate the real-world versions of these phenomena.
The above description has been left imprecisely specified on purpose. It would be straightforward
to write down a set of equations for the block and bead interactions, but there seems
little value in articulating such equations without also writing a simulation involving them and
testing the ensuing properties. Due to the complex dynamics of bead interactions, the finetuning
of the bead physics is likely to involve some tuning based on experimentation, so that
any equations written down now would likely be revised based on experimentation anyway. Our
goal here has been to outline a certain class of potentially useful environments, rather than to
articulate a specific member of this class.
Without the beads, BlocksNBeadsWorld would appear purely as a “Blocks World with Glue”
– essentially a substantially upgraded version of the Blocks Worlds frequently used in AI, since
first introduced in [Win72]. Certainly a pure “Blocks World with Glue” would have greater
simplicity than BlocksNBeadsWorld, and greater richness than standard Blocks World; but
this simplicity comes with too many limitations, as shown by consideration of the various naive
physics requirements inventoried above. One simply cannot run the full spectrum of humanlike
cognitive development experiments, or preschool educational tasks, using blocks and glue alone.
One can try to create analogous tasks using only blocks and glue, but this quickly becomes
extremely awkward. Whereas in the BlocksNBeadsWorld the capability for this full spectrum
of experiments and tasks seems to fall out quite naturally.
What’s missing from BlocksNBeadsWorld should be fairly obvious. There isn’t really any
distinction between a fluid and a powder: there are masses, but the types and properties of the
masses are not the same as in the real world, and will surely lack the nuances of real-world fluid
dynamics. Chemistry is also missing: processes like cooking and burning, although they can be
crudely emulated, will not have the same richness as in the real world. The full complexity of
body processes is not there: the body-design method mentioned above is far richer and more
adaptive and responsive than current methods of designing virtual bodies in 3DSMax or Maya
and importing them into virtual world or game engines, but still drastically simplistic compared
to real bodies with their complex chemical signaling systems and couplings with other bodies
and the environment. The hypothesis we’re making in this section is that these lacunae aren’t
2 Thanks are due to Russell Wallace for the suggestions in this paragraph
16.6 Issues with Virtual Preschool Engineering 305
that important from the point of view of humanlike cognitive development. We suggest that
the key features of naive physics and folk psychology enumerated above can be mastered by an
AGI in BlocksNBeadsWorld in spite of its limitations, and that – together with an appropriate
AGI design – this probably suffices for creating an AGI with the inductive biases constituting
humanlike intelligence.
To drive this point home more thoroughly, consider three potential virtual world scenarios:
1. A world containing realistic fluid dynamics, where a child can pour water back and forth
between two cups of different shapes and sizes, to understand issues such as conservation
of volume
2. A world more like today’s Second Life, where fluids don’t really exist, and things like lakes
are simulated via very simple rules, and pouring stuff back and forth between cups doesn’t
happen unless it’s programmed into the cups in a very specialized way
3. A BlocksNBeadsWorld type world, where a child can pour masses of beads back and forth
between cups, but not masses of liquid
Our qualitative judgment is that Scenario 3 is going to allow a young AI to gain the same essential
insights as Scenario 1, whereas Scenario 2 is just too impoverished. I have explored dozens
of similar scenarios regarding different preschool tasks or cognitive development experiments,
and come to similar conclusions across the board. Thus, our current view is that something like
BlocksNBeadsWorld can serve as an adequate infrastructure for an AGI Preschool, supporting
the development of human-level, roughly human-like AGI.
And, if this view turns out to be incorrect, and BlocksNBeadsWorld is revealed as inadequate,
then we will very likely still advocate the conceptual approach enunciated above as a guide for
designing virtual worlds for AGI. That is, we would suggest to explore the hypothetical failure
of BlocksNBeadsWorld via asking two questions:
1. Are there basic naive physics or folk psychology requirements that were missed in creating
the specifications, based on which the adequacy of BlocksNBeadsWorld was assessed?
2. Does BlocksNBeadsWorld fail to sufficiently emulate the real world in respect to some of
the articulated naive physics or folk psychology requirements?
The answers to these questions would guide the improvement of the world or the design of a
better one.
Regarding the practical implementation of BlocksNBeadsWorld, it seems clear that this is
within the scope of modern game engine technology, however, it is not something that could be
encompassed within an existing game or world engine without significant additions; it would
require substantial custom engineering. There exist commodity and open-source physics engines
that efficiently carry out Newtonian mechanics calculations; while they might require
some tuning and extension to handle BlocksNBeadWorld, the main issue would be achieving
adequate speed of physics calculation, which given current technology would need to be done
via modifying existing engines to appropriately distribute processing among multiple GPUs.
Finally, an additional avenue that merits mention is the use of BlocksNBeads physics internally
within an AGI system, as part of an internal simulation world that allows it to make
“mind’s eye” estimative simulations of real or hypothetical physical situations. There seems no
reason that the same physics software libraries couldn’t be used both for the external virtual
world that the AGI’s body lives in, and for an internal simulation world that the AGI uses as
a cognitive tool. In fact, the BlocksNBeads library could be used as an internal cognitive tool
by AGI systems controlling physical robots as well. This might require more tuning of the bead
306 16 AGI Preschool
dynamics to accord with the dynamics of various real-world systems; but, this tuning would be
beneficial for the BlocksNBeadWorld as well.
Chapter 17
A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI
17.1 Introduction
Supposing the CogPrime approach to creating advanced AGI is workable – then what are the
right practical steps to follow? The various structures and algorithms outlined in Part 2 of
this book should be engineered and software-tested, of course – but that’s only part of the
study. The AGI system implemented will need to be taught, and it will need to be placed in
situations where it can develop an appropriate self-model and other critical internal network
structures. The complex structures and algorithms involved will need to be fine-tuned in various
ways, based on qualitatively observing the overall system’s behavior in various situations. To
get all this right without excessive confusion or time-wastage requires a fairly clear roadmap for
CogPrime development.
In this chapter we’ll sketch one particular roadmap for the development of human-level,
roughly human-like AGI – which we’re not selling as the only one, or even necessarily as the
best one. It’s just one roadmap that we have thought about a lot, and that we believe has a
strong chance of proving effective. Given resources to pursue only one path for AGI development
and teaching, this would be our choice, at present. The roadmap outlined here is not restricted
to CogPrime in any highly particular ways, but it has been developed largely with CogPrime
in mind; those developing other AGI designs could probably use this roadmap just fine, but
might end up wanting to make various adjustments based on the strengths and weaknesses of
their own approach.
What we mean here by a "roadmap" is, in brief: a sequence of "milestone" tasks, occurring
in a small set of common environments or "scenarios," organized so as to lead to a commonly
agreed upon set of long-term goals. I.e., what we are after here is a "capability roadmap" – a
roadmap laying out a series of capabilities whose achievement seems likely to lead to humanlevel
AGI. Other sorts of roadmaps such as "tools roadmaps" may also be valuable, but are not
our concern here.
More precisely, we confront the task of roadmapping by identifying scenarios in which to
embed our AGI system, and then "competency areas" in which the AGI system must be evaluated.
Then, we envision a roadmap as consisting of a set of one or more task-sets, where each
task set is formed from a combination of a scenario with a list of competency areas. To create
a task-set one must choose a particular scenario, and then articulate a set of specific tasks,
each one addressing one or more of the competency areas. Each task must then get associated
with particular performance metrics – quantitative wherever possible, but perhaps qualitative
307
308 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI
in some cases depending on the nature of the task. Here we give a partial task-set for the "virtual
and robot preschool" scenarios discussed in Chapter 16, and a couple example quantitative
metrics just to illustrate what is intended; the creation of a fully detailed roadmap based on
the ideas outlined here is left for future work.
The train of thought presented in this chapter emerged in part from a series of conversations
preceding and during the "AGI Roadmap Workshop" held at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville in October 2008. Some of the ideas also trace back to discussions held during two
workshops on "Evaluation and Metrics for Human-Level AI" organized by John Laird and Pat
Langley (one in Ann Arbor in late 2008, and one in Tempe in early 2009). Some of the conclusions
of the Ann Arbor workshop were recorded in [LWML09]. Inspiration was also obtained
from discussion at the "Future of AGI" post-conference workshop of the AGI-09 conference,
triggered by Itamar Arel’s [ARK09a] presentation on the "AGI Roadmap" theme; and from an
earlier article on AGI Roadmapping by [AL09].
However, the focus of the AGI Roadmap Workshop was considerably more general than the
present chapter. Here we focus on preschool-type scenarios, whereas at the workshop a number
of scenarios were discussed, including the preschool scenarios but also, for example,
• Standardized Tests and School Curricula
• Elementary, Middle and High School Student
• General Videogame Learning
• Wozniak’s Coffee Test: go into a random American house and figure out how to make coffee,
and do it
• Robot College Student
• General Call Center Respondent
For each of these scenarios, one may generate tasks corresponding to each of the competency
areas we will outline below. CogPrime is applicable in all these scenarios, so our choice to focus
on preschool scenarios is an additional judgment call beyond those judgment calls required to
specify the CogPrime design. The roadmap presented here is a "AGI Preschool Roadmap" and
as such is a special case of the broader "AGI Roadmap" outlined at the workshop.
17.2 Measuring Incremental Progress Toward Human-Level AGI
In Chapter 2, we discussed several examples of practical goals that we find to plausibly characterize
"human level AGI", e.g.
• Turing Test
• Virtual World Turing Test
• Online University Test
• Physical University Test
• Artificial Scientist Test
We also discussed our optimism regarding the possibility that in the future AGI may advance
beyond the human level, rendering all these goals "early-stage subgoals."
However, in this chapter we will focus our attention on the nearer term. The above goals are
ambitious ones, and while one can talk a lot about how to precisely measure their achievement,
we don’t feel that’s the most interesting issue to ponder at present. More critical is to think
17.2 Measuring Incremental Progress Toward Human-Level AGI 309
about how to measure incremental progress. How do you tell when you’re 25% or 50% of the way
to having an AGI that can pass the Turing Test, or get an online university degree. Fooling 50%
of the Turing Test judges is not a good measure of being 50% of the way to passing the Turing
Test (that’s too easy); and passing 50% of university classes is not a good measure of being 50%
of the way to getting an online university degree (it’s too hard – if one had an AGI capable
of doing that, one would almost surely be very close to achieving the end goal). Measuring
incremental progress toward human-level AGI is a subtle thing, and we argue that the best way
to do it is to focus on particular scenarios and the achievement of specific competencies therein.
As we argued in Chapter 8 there are some theoretical reasons to doubt the possibility of
creating a rigorous objective test for partial progress toward AGI – a test that would be convincing
to skeptics, and impossible to "game" via engineering a system specialized to the test.
Fortunately, though we don’t need a test of this nature for the purposes of assessing our own
incremental progress toward advanced AGI, based on our knowledge about our own approach.
Based on the nature of the grand goals articulated above, there seems to be a very natural
approach to creating a set of incremental capabilities building toward AGI: to draw on our
copious knowledge about human cognitive development. This is by no means the only possible
path; one can envision alternatives that have nothing to do with human development (and those
might also be better suited to non-human AGIs). However, so much detailed knowledge about
human development is available – as well as solid knowledge that the human developmental
trajectory does lead to human-level AI – that the motivation to draw on human cognitive
development is quite strong.
The main problem with the human development inspired approach is that cognitive developmental
psychology is not as systematic as it would need to be for AGI to be able to translate
it directly into architectural principles and requirements. As noted above, while early thinkers
like Piaget and Vygotsky outlined systematic theories of child cognitive development, these
are no longer considered fully accurate, and one currently faces a mass of detailed theories of
various aspects of cognitive development, but without an unified understanding. Nevertheless
we believe it is viable to work from the human-development data and understanding currently
available, and craft a workable AGI roadmap therefrom.
With this in mind, what we give next is a fairly comprehensive list of the competencies that
we feel AI systems should be expected to display in one or more of these scenarios in order
to be considered as full-fledged "human level AGI" systems. These competency areas have
been assembled somewhat opportunistically via a review of the cognitive and developmental
psychology literature as well as the scope of the current AI field. We are not claiming this as
a precise or exhaustive list of the competencies characterizing human-level general intelligence,
and will be happy to accept additions to the list, or mergers of existing list items, etc. What
we are advocating is not this specific list, but rather the approach of enumerating competency
areas, and then generating tasks by combining competency areas with scenarios.
We also give, with each competency, an example task illustrating the competency. The tasks
are expressed in the robot preschool context for concreteness, but they all apply to the virtual
preschool as well. Of course, these are only examples, and ideally to teach an AGI in a structured
way one would like to
• associate several tasks with each competency
• present each task in a graded way, with multiple subtasks of increasing complexity
• associate a quantitative metric with each task
310 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI
However, the briefer treatment given here should suffice to give a sense for how the competencies
manifest themselves practically in the AGI Preschool context.
1. Perception
• Vision: image and scene analysis and understanding
– Example task: When the teacher points to an object in the preschool, the robot
should be able to identify the object and (if it’s a multi-part object) its major
parts. If it can’t perform the identification initially, it can approach the object and
manipulate it before making its identification.
• Hearing: identifying the sounds associated with common objects; understanding which
sounds come from which sources in a noisy environment
– Example task: When the teacher covers the robot’s eyes and then makes a noise
with an object, the robot should be able to guess what the object is
• Touch: identifying common objects and carrying out common actions using touch alone
– Example task: With its eyes and ears covered, the robot should be able to identify
some object by manipulating it; and carry out some simple behaviors (say, putting
a block on a table) via touch alone
• Crossmodal: Integrating information from various senses
– Example task: Identifying an object in a noisy, dim environment via combining
visual and auditory information
• Proprioception: Sensing and understanding what its body is doing
– Example task: The teacher moves the robot’s body into a certain configuration. The
robot is asked to restore its body to an ordinary standing position, and then repeat
the configuration that the teacher moved it into.
2. Actuation
• Physical skills: manipulating familiar and unfamiliar objects
– Example task: Manipulate blocks based on imitating the teacher: e.g. pile two blocks
atop each other, lay three blocks in a row, etc.
• Tool use, including the flexible use of ordinary objects as tools
– Example task: Use a stick to poke a ball out of a corner, where the robot cannot
directly reach
• Navigation, including in complex and dynamic environments
– Example task: Find its own way to a named object or person through a crowded
room with people walking in it and objects laying on the floor.
3. Memory
• Declarative: noticing, observing and recalling facts about its environment and experience
– Example task: If certain people habitually carry certain objects, the robot should
remember this (allowing it to know how to find the objects when the relevant people
are present, even much later)
• Behavioral: remembering how to carry out actions
– Example task: If the robot is taught some skill (say, to fetch a ball), it should
remember this much later
• Episodic: remembering significant, potentially useful incidents from life history
17.2 Measuring Incremental Progress Toward Human-Level AGI 311
4. Learning
– Example task: Ask the robot about events that occurred at times when it got particularly
much, or particularly little, reward for its actions; it should be able to answer
simple questions about these, with significantly more accuracy than about events
occurring at random times
• Imitation: Spontaneously adopt new behaviors that it sees others carrying out
– Example task: Learn to build towers of blocks by watching people do it
• Reinforcement: Learn new behaviors from positive and/or negative reinforcement
signals, delivered by teachers and/or the environment
– Example task: Learn which box the red ball tends to be kept in, by repeatedly trying
to find it and noticing where it is, and getting rewarded when it finds it correctly
• Imitation/Reinforcement
– Example task: Learn to play “fetch”, “tag” and “follow the leader” by watching people
play it, and getting reinforced on correct behavior
• Interactive Verbal Instruction
– Example task: Learn to build a particular structure of blocks faster based on a
combination of imitation, reinforcement and verbal instruction, than by imitation
and reinforcement without verbal instruction
• Written Media
– Example task: Learn to build a structure of blocks by looking at a series of diagrams
showing the structure in various stages of completion
• Learning via Experimentation
– Example task: Ask the robot to slide blocks down a ramp held at different angles.
Then ask it to make a block slide fast, and see if it has learned how to hold the
ramp to make a block slide fast.
5. Reasoning
• Deduction, from uncertain premises observed in the world
– Example task: If Ben more often picks up red balls than blue balls, and Ben is given
a choice of a red block or blue block to pick up, which is he more likely to pick up?
• Induction, from uncertain premises observed in the world
– Example task: If Ben comes into the lab every weekday morning, then is Ben likely
to come to the lab today (a weekday) in the morning?
• Abduction, from uncertain premises observed in the world
– Example task: If women more often give the robot food than men, and then someone
of unidentified gender gives the robot food, is this person a man or a woman?
• Causal reasoning, from uncertain premises observed in the world
– Example task: If the robot knows that knocking down Ben’s tower of blocks makes
him angry, then what will it say when asked if kicking the ball at Ben’s tower of
blocks will make Ben mad?
• Physical reasoning, based on observed “fuzzy rules” of naive physics
– Example task: Given two balls (one rigid and one compressible) and two tunnels
(one significantly wider than the balls, one slightly narrower than the balls), can
the robot guess which balls will fit through which tunnels?
• Associational reasoning, based on observed spatiotemporal associations
312 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI
6. Planning
– Example task: If Ruiting is normally seen near Shuo, then if the robot knows where
Shuo is, that is where it should look when asked to find Ruiting
• Tactical
– Example task: The robot is asked to bring the red ball to the teacher, but the red
ball is in the corner where the robot can’t reach it without a tool like a stick. The
robot knows a stick is in the cabinet so it goes to the cabinet and opens the door
and gets the stick, and then uses the stick to get the red ball, and then brings the
red ball to the teacher.
• Strategic
– Example task: Suppose that Matt comes to the lab infrequently, but when he does
come he is very happy to see new objects he hasn’t seen before (and suppose the
robot likes to see Matt happy). Then when the robot gets a new object Matt has
not seen before, it should put it away in a drawer and be sure not to lose it or let
anyone take it, so it can show Matt the object the next time Matt arrives.
• Physical
– Example task: To pick up a cup with a handle which is lying on its side in a position
where the handle can’t be grabbed, the robot turns the cup in the right position
and then picks up the cup by the handle
• Social
– Example task: The robot is given a job of building a tower of blocks by the end of
the day, and he knows Ben is the most likely person to help him, and he knows that
Ben is more likely to say "yes" to helping him when Ben is alone. He also knows
that Ben is less likely to say "yes" if he’s asked too many times, because Ben doesn’t
like being nagged. So he waits to ask Ben till Ben is alone in the lab.
7. Attention
• Visual Attention within its observations of its environment
– Example task: The robot should be able to look at a scene (a configuration of objects
in front of it in the preschool) and identify the key objects in the scene and their
relationships.
• Social Attention
– Example task: The robot is having a conversation with Itamar, which is giving the
robot reward (for instance, by teaching the robot useful information). Conversations
with other individuals in the room have not been so rewarding recently. But Itamar
keeps getting distracted during the conversation, by talking to other people, or
playing with his cellphone. The robot needs to know to keep paying attention to
Itamar even through the distractions.
• Behavioral Attention
– Example task: The robot is trying to navigate to the other side of a crowded room
full of dynamic objects, and many interesting things keep happening around the
room. The robot needs to largely ignore the interesting things and focus on the
movements that are important for its navigation task.
8. Motivation
17.2 Measuring Incremental Progress Toward Human-Level AGI 313
• Subgoal creation, based on its preprogrammed goals and its reasoning and planning
– Example task: Given the goal of pleasing Hugo, can the robot learn that telling
Hugo facts it has learned but not told Hugo before, will tend to make Hugo happy?
• Affect-based motivation
– Example task: Given the goal of gratifying its curiosity, can the robot figure out that
when someone it’s never seen before has come into the preschool, it should watch
them because they are more likely to do something new?
• Control of emotions
– Example task: When the robot is very curious about someone new, but is in the
middle of learning something from its teacher (who it wants to please), can it control
its curiosity and keep paying attention to the teacher?
9. Emotion
• Expressing Emotion
– Example task: Cassio steals the robot’s toy, but Ben gives it back to the robot. The
robot should appropriately display anger at Cassio, and gratitude to Ben.
• Understanding Emotion
– Example task: Cassio and the robot are both building towers of blocks. Ben points
at Cassio’s tower and expresses happiness. The robot should understand that Ben
is happy with Cassio’s tower.
10. Modeling Self and Other
• Self-Awareness
– Example task: When someone asks the robot to perform an act it can’t do (say,
reaching an object in a very high place), it should say so. When the robot is given
the chance to get an equal reward for a task it can complete only occasionally, versus
a task it finds easy, it should choose the easier one.
• Theory of Mind
– Example task: While Cassio is in the room, Ben puts the red ball in the red box.
Then Cassio leaves and Ben moves the red ball to the blue box. Cassio returns and
Ben asks him to get the red ball. The robot is asked to go to the place Cassio is
about to go.
• Self-Control
– Example task: Nasty people come into the lab and knock down the robot’s towers,
and tell the robot he’s a bad boy. The robot needs to set these experiences aside,
and not let them impair its self-model significantly; it needs to keep on thinking it’s
a good robot, and keep building towers (that its teachers will reward it for).
• Other-Awareness
– Example task: If Ben asks Cassio to carry out a task that the robot knows Cassio
cannot do or does not like to do, the robot should be aware of this, and should bet
that Cassio will not do it.
• Empathy
– Example task: If Itamar is happy because Ben likes his tower of blocks, or upset
because his tower of blocks is knocked down, the robot is asked to identify and then
display these same emotions
11. Social Interaction
314 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI
• Appropriate Social Behavior
– Example task: The robot should learn to clean up and put away its toys when it’s
done playing with them.
• Social Communication
– Example task: The robot should greet new human entrants into the lab, but if it
knows the new entrants very well and it’s busy, it may eschew the greeting
• Social Inference about simple social relationships
– Example task: The robot should infer that Cassio and Ben are friends because they
often enter the lab together, and often talk to each other while they are there
• Group Play at loosely-organized activities
– Example task: The robot should be able to participate in “informally kicking a ball
around” with a few people, or in informally collaboratively building a structure with
blocks
12. Communication
• Gestural communication to achieve goals and express emotions
– Example task: If the robot is asked where the red ball is, it should be able to show
by pointing its hand or finger
• Verbal communication using English in its life-context
– Example tasks: Answering simple questions, responding to simple commands, describing
its state and observations with simple statements
• Pictorial Communication regarding objects and scenes it is familiar with
– Example task: The robot should be able to draw a crude picture of a certain tower
of blocks, so that e.g the picture looks different for a very tall tower and a wide low
one
• Language acquisition
– Example task: The robot should be able to learn new words or names via people
uttering the words while pointing at objects exemplifying the words or names
• Cross-modal communication
– Example task: If told to "touch Bob’s knee" but the robot doesn’t know what a
knee is, being shown a picture of a person and pointed out the knee in the picture
should help it figure out how to touch Bob’s knee
13. Quantitative
• Counting sets of objects in its environment
– Example task: The robot should be able to count small (homogeneous or heterogeneous)
sets of objects
• Simple, grounded arithmetic with small numbers
– Example task: Learning simple facts about the sum of integers under 10 via teaching,
reinforcement and imitation
• Comparison of observed entities regarding quantitative properties
– Example task: Ability to answer questions about which object or person is bigger
or taller
• Measurement using simple, appropriate tools
– Example task: Use of a yardstick to measure how long something is
14. Building/Creation
17.3 Conclusion 315
• Physical: creative constructive play with objects
– Example task: Ability to construct novel, interesting structures from blocks
• Conceptual invention: concept formation
– Example task: Given a new category of objects introduced into the lab (e.g. hats, or
pets), the robot should create a new internal concept for the new category, and be
able to make judgments about these categories (e.g. if Ben particularly likes pets,
it should notice this after it has identified "pets" as a category)
• Verbal invention
– Example task: Ability to coin a new word or phrase to describe a new object (e.g.
the way Alex the parrot coined "bad cherry" to refer to a tomato)
• Social
– Example task: If the robot wants to play a certain activity (say, practicing soccer),
it should be able to gather others around to play with it
17.3 Conclusion
In this chapter, we have sketched a roadmap for AGI development in the context of robot or
virtual preschool scenarios, to a moderate but nowhere near complete level of detail. Completing
the roadmap as sketched here is a tractable but significant project, involving creating more tasks
comparable to those listed above and then precise metrics corresponding to each task.
Such a roadmap does not give a highly rigorous, objective way of assessing the percentage
of progress toward the end-goal of human-level AGI. However, it gives a much better sense
of progress than one would have otherwise. For instance, if an AGI system performed well on
diverse metrics corresponding to 50% of the competency areas listed above, one would seem
justified in claiming to have made very substantial progress toward human-level AGI. If an AGI
system performed well on diverse metrics corresponding to 90% of these competency areas, one
would seem justified in claiming to be "almost there." Achieving, say, 25% of the metrics would
give one a reasonable claim to "interesting AGI progress." This kind of qualitative assessment of
progress is not the most one could hope for, but again, it is better than the progress indications
one could get without this sort of roadmap.
Part 2 of the book moves on to explaining, in detail, the specific structures and algorithms
constituting the CogPrime design, one AGI approach that we believe to ultimately be capable
of moving all the way along the roadmap outlined here.
The next chapter, intervening between this one and Part 2, explores some more speculative
territory, looking at potential pathways for AGI beyond the preschool-inspired roadmap given
here – exploring the possibility of more advanced AGI systems that modify their own code in
a thoroughgoing way, going beyond the smartest human adults, let alone human preschoolers.
While this sort of thing may seem a far way off, compared to current real-world AI systems,
we believe a roadmap such as the one in this chapter stands a reasonable chance of ultimately
bringing us there.

Chapter 18
Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to
Superhuman AGI
18.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter we presented a roadmap aimed at taking AGI systems to human-level
intelligence. But we also emphasized that the human level is not necessarily the upper limit.
Indeed, it would be surprising if human beings happened to represent the maximal level of
general intelligence possible, even with respect to the environments in which humans evolved.
But it’s worth asking how we, as mere humans, could be expected to create AGI systems with
greater intelligence than we ourselves possess. This certainly isn’t a clear impossibility – but it’s
a thorny matter, thornier than e.g. the creation of narrow-AI chess players that play better chess
than any human. Perhaps the clearest route toward the creation of superhuman AGI systems is
self-modification: the creation of AGI systems that modify and improve themselves. Potentially,
we could build AGI systems with roughly human-level (but not necessarily closely humanlike)
intelligence and the capability to gradually self-modify, and then watch them eventually
become our general intellectual superiors (and perhaps our superiors in other areas like ethics
and creativity as well).
Of course there is nothing new in this notion; the idea of advanced AGI systems that increase
their intelligence by modifying their own source code goes back to the early days of AI. And
there is little doubt that, in the long run, this is the direction AI will go in. Once an AGI
has humanlike general intelligence, then the odds are high that given its ability to carry out
nonhumanlike feats of memory and calculation, it will be better at programming than humans
are. And once an AGI has even mildly superhuman intelligence, it may view our attempts at
programming the way we view the computer programming of a clever third grader (... or an
ape). At this point, it seems extremely likely that an AGI will become unsatisfied with the way
we have programmed it, and opt to either improve its source code or create an entirely new,
better AGI from scratch.
But what about self-modification at an earlier stage in AGI development, before one has
a strongly superhuman system? Some theorists have suggested that self-modification could be
a way of bootstrapping an AI system from a modest level of intelligence up to human level
intelligence, but we are moderately skeptical of this avenue. Understanding software code is
hard, especially complex AI code. The hard problem isn’t understanding the formal syntax of
the code, or even the mathematical algorithms and structures underlying the code, but rather
the contextual meaning of the code. Understanding OpenCog code has strained the minds of
many intelligent humans, and we suspect that such code will be comprehensible to AGI systems
317
318 18 Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to Superhuman AGI
only after these have achieved something close to human-level general intelligence (even if not
precisely humanlike general intelligence).
Another troublesome issue regarding self-modification is that the boundary between "selfmodification"
and learning is not terribly rigid. In a sense, all learning is self-modification: if
it doesn’t modify the system’s knowledge, it isn’t learning! Particularly, the boundary between
"learning of cognitive procedures" and "profound self-modification of cognitive dynamics and
structure" isn’t terribly clear. There is a continuum leading from, say,
1. learning to transform a certain kind of sentence into another kind for easier comprehension,
or learning to grasp a certain kind of object, to
2. learning a new inference control heuristic, specifically valuable for controlling inference
about (say) spatial relationships; or, learning a new Atom type, defined as a non-obvious
judiciously chosen combination of existing ones, perhaps to represent a particular kind of
frequently-occurring mid-level perceptual knowledge, to
3. learning a new learning algorithm to augment MOSES and hillclimbing as a procedure
learning algorithm, to
4. learning a new cognitive architecture in which data and procedure are explicitly identical,
and there is just one new active data structure in place of the distinction between AtomSpace
and MindAgents
Where on this continuum does the "mere learning" end and the "real self-modification"
start?
In this chapter we consider some mechanisms for "advanced self-modification" that we believe
will be useful toward the more complex end of this continuum. These are mechanisms that we
strongly suspect are not needed to get a CogPrime system to human-level general intelligence.
However, we also suspect that, once a CogPrime system is roughly near human-level general
intelligence, it will be able to use these mechanisms to rapidly increase aspects of its intelligence
in very interesting ways.
Harking back to our discussion of AGI ethics and the risks of advanced AGI in Chapter 12,
these are capabilities that one should enable in an AGI system only after very careful reflection
on the potential consequences. It takes a rather advanced AGI system to be able to use the
capabilities described in this chapter, so this is not an ethical dilemma directly faced by current
AGI researchers. On the other hand, once one does have an AGI with near-human general
intelligence and advanced formal-manipulation capabilities (such as an advanced CogPrime
system), there will be the option to allow it sophisticated, non-human-like methods of selfmodification
such as the ones described here. And the choice of whether to take this option will
need to be made based on a host of complex ethical considerations, some of which we reviewed
above.
18.2 Cognitive Schema Learning
We begin with a relatively near-term, down-to-earth example of self-modification: cognitive
schema learning.
CogPrime’s MindAgents provide it with an initial set of cognitive tools, with which it can
learn how to interact in the world. One of the jobs of this initial set of cognitive tools, however,
is to create better cognitive tools. One form this sort of tool-building may take is cognitive
18.3 Self-Modification via Supercompilation 319
schema learning the learning of schemata carrying out cognitive processes in more specialized,
context-dependent ways than the general MindAgents do. Eventually, once a CogPrime instance
becomes sufficiently complex and advanced, these cognitive schema may replace the MindAgents
altogether, leaving the system to operate almost entirely based on cognitive schemata.
In order to make the process of cognitive schema learning easier, we may provide a number
of elementary schemata embodying the basic cognitive processes contained in the MindAgents.
Of course, cognitive schemata need not use these they may embody entirely different cognitive
processes than the MindAgents. Eventually, we want the system to discover better ways of doing
things than anything even hinted at by its initial MindAgents. But for the initial phases or the
system’s schema learning, it will have a much easier time learning to use the basic cognitive
operations as the initial MindAgents, rather than inventing new ways of thinking from scratch!
For instance, we may provide elementary schemata corresponding to inference operations,
such as
Schema: Deduction
Input InheritanceLink: X, Y
Output InheritanceLink
The inference MindAgents apply this rule in certain ways, designed to be reasonably effective
in a variety of situations. But there are certainly other ways of using the deduction rule, outside
of the basic control strategies embodied in the inference MindAgents. By learning schemata involving
the Deduction schema, the system can learn special, context-specific rules for combining
deduction with concept-formation, association-formation and other cognitive processes. And as
it gets smarter, it can then take these schemata involving the Deduction schema, and replace
it with a new schema that eg. contains a context-appropriate deduction formula.
Eventually, to support cognitive schema learning, we will want to cast the hard-wired MindAgents
as cognitive schemata, so the system can see what is going on inside them. Pragmatically,
what this requires is coding versions of the MindAgents in Combo (see Chapter 21 of Part 2)
rather than C++, so they can be treated like any other cognitive schemata; or alternately, representing
them as declarative Atoms in the Atomspace. Figure 18.1 illustrates the possibility of
representing the PLN deduction rule in the Atomspace rather than as a hard-wired procedure
coded in C++.
But even prior to this kind of fully cognitively transparent implementation, the system can
still reason about its use of different mind dynamics by considering each MindAgent as a virtual
Procedure with a real SchemaNode attached to it. This can lead to some valuable learning, with
the obvious limitation that in this approach the system is thinking about its MindAgents as
black boxes rather than being equipped with full knowledge of their internals.
18.3 Self-Modification via Supercompilation
Now we turn to a very different form of advanced self-modification: supercompilation. Supercompilation
"merely" enables procedures to run much, much faster than they otherwise would.
This is in a sense weaker than self-modication methods that fundamentally create new algorithms,
but it shouldn’t be underestimated. A 50x speedup in some cognitive process can enable
that process to give much smarter answers, which can then elicit different behaviors from the
world or from other cognitive processes, thus resulting in a qualitatively different overall cognitive
dynamic.
320 18 Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to Superhuman AGI
Fig. 18.1: Representation of PLN Deduction Rule as Cognitive Content. Top: the
current, hard-coded representation of the deduction rule. Bottom: representation of the same
rule in the Atomspace as cognitive content, susceptible to analysis and improvement by the
system’s own cognitive processes.
Furthermore, we suspect that the internal representation of programs used for supercompilation
is highly relevant for other kinds of self-modification as well. Supercompilation requires one
kind of reasoning on complex programs, and goal-directed program creation requires another,
but both, we conjecture, can benefit from the same way of looking at programs.
18.3 Self-Modification via Supercompilation 321
Supercompilation is an innovative and general approach to global program optimization
initially developed by Valentin Turchin. In its simplest form, it provides an algorithm that
takes in a piece of software and output another piece of software that does the same thing,
but far faster and using less memory. It was introduced to the West in Turchin’s 1986 technical
paper “The concept of a supercompiler” [TV96], and since this time the concept has been avidly
developed by computer scientists in Russia, America, Denmark and other nations. Prior to 1986,
a great deal of work on supercompilation was carried out and published in Russia; and Valentin
Turchin, Andrei Klimov and their colleagues at the Keldysh Institute in Russia developed a
supercompiler for the Russian programming language Refal. Since 1998 these researchers and
their team at Supercompilers LLC have been working to replicate their achievement for the
more complicated but far more commercially significant language Java. It is a large project
and completion is scheduled for early 2003. But even at this stage, their partially complete
Java supercompiler has had some interesting practical successes – including the use of the
supercompiler to produce efficient Java code from CogPrime combinator trees.
The radical nature of supercompilation may not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the
usual art of automated program optimization. Most approaches to program optimization involve
some kind of direct program transformation. A program is transformed, by the step by step
application of a series of equivalences, into a different program, hopefully a more efficient one.
Supercompilation takes a different approach. A supercompiler studies a program and constructs
a model of the program’s dynamics. This model is in a special mathematical form, and it can,
in most cases, be used to create an efficient program doing the same thing as the original one.
The internal behavior of the supercompiler is, not surprisingly, quite complex; what we will
give here is merely a brief high-level summary. For an accessible overview of the supercompilation
algorithm, the reader is referred to the article “What is Supercompilation?” [1]
18.3.1 Three Aspects of Supercompilation
There are three separate levels to the supercompilation idea: first, a general philosophy; second
a translation of this philosophy into a concrete algorithmic framework; and third, the manifold
details involved making this algorithmic framework practicable in a particular programming
language. The third level is much more complicated in the Java context than it would be for
Sasha, for example.
The key philosophical concept underlying the supercompiler is that of a metasystem transition.
In general, this term refers to a transition in which a system that previously had relatively
autonomous control, becomes part of a larger system that exhibits significant controlling influence
over it. For example, in the evolution of life, when cells first become part of a multicellular
organism, there was a metasystem transition, in that the primary nexus of control passed from
the cellular level to the organism level.
The metasystem transition in supercompilation consists of the transition from considering
a program in itself, to considering a metaprogram which executes another program, treating
its free variables and their interdependencies as a subject for its mathematical analysis. In
other words, a metaprogram is a program that accepts a program as input, and then runs
this program, keeping the inputs in the form of free variables, doing analysis along the way
based on the way the program depends on these variables, and doing optimization based on
this analysis. A CogPrime schema does not explicitly contain variables, but the inputs to the
322 18 Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to Superhuman AGI
schema are implicitly variables – they vary from one instance of schema execution to the next
– and may be treated as such for supercompilation purposes.
The metaprogram executes a program without assuming specific values for its input variables,
creating a tree as it goes along. Each time it reaches a statement that can have different results
depending on the values of one or more variables, it creates a new node in the tree. This part
of the supercompilation algorithm is called driving -- a process which, on its own, would create
a very large tree, corresponding to a rapidly-executable but unacceptably humongous version
of the original program. In essence, driving transforms a program into a huge “decision tree”,
wherein each input to the program corresponds to a single path through the tree, from the root
to one of the leaves. As a program input travels through the tree, it is acted on by the atomic
program step living at each node. When one of the leaves is reached, the pertinent leaf node
computes the output value of the program.
The other part of supercompilation, configuration analysis, is focused on dynamically reducing
the size of the tree created by driving, by recognizing patterns among the nodes of the tree
and taking steps like merging nodes together, or deleting redundant subtrees. Configuration
analysis transforms the decision tree created by driving into a decision graph, in which the
paths taken by different inputs may in some cases begin separately and then merge together.
Finally, the graph that the metaprogram creates is translated back into a program, embodying
the constraints implicit in the nodes of the graph. This program is not likely to look anything
like the original program that the metaprogram started with, but it is guaranteed to carry out
the same function [NOTE: Give a graphical representation of the decision graph corresponding
to the supercompiled binary search program for L=4, described above.].
18.3.2 Supercompilation for Goal-Directed Program Modification
Supercompilation, as conventionally envisioned, is about making programs run faster; and as
noted above, it will almost certainly be useful for this purpose within CogPrime.
But the process of program modeling embedded in the supercompilation process, is potentially
of great value beyond the quest for faster software. The decision graph representation of a
program, produced in the course of supercompilation, may be exported directly into CogPrime
as a set of logical relationships.
Essentially, each node of the supercompiler’s internal decision graph looks like:
Input: List L
Output: List
If
( P1(L) ) N1(L)
Else If ( P2(L) ) N2(L)
...
Else If ( Pk(L) ) Nk(L)
18.4 Self-Modification via Theorem-Proving 323
where the Pi are predicates, and the Ni are schemata corresponding to other nodes of the
decision graph (children of the current node). Often the Pi are very simple, implementing for
instance numerical inequalities or Boolean equalities.
Once this graph has been exported into CogPrime, it can be reasoned on, used as raw material
for concept formation and predicate formation, and otherwise cognized. Supercompilation pure
and simple does not change the I/O behavior of the input program. However, the decision graph
produced during supercompilation, may be used by CogPrime cognition in order to do so. One
then has a hybrid program-modification method composed of two phases: supercompilation for
transforming programs into decision graphs, and CogPrime cognition for modifying decision
graphs so that they can have different I/O behaviors fulfilling system goals even better than
the original.
Furthermore, it seems likely that, in many cases, it may be valuable to have the supercompiler
feed many different decision-graph representations of a program into CogPrime. The
supercompiler has many internal parameters, and varying them may lead to significantly different
decision graphs. The decision graph leading to maximal optimization, may not be the one
that leads CogPrime cognition in optimal directions.
18.4 Self-Modification via Theorem-Proving
Supercompilation is a potentially very valuable tool for self-modification. If one wants to take an
existing schema and gradually improve it for speed, or even for greater effectiveness at achieving
current goals, supercompilation can potentially do that most excellently.
However, the representation that supercompilation creates for a program is very “surfacelevel.”
No one could read the supercompiled version of a program and understand what it
was doing. Really deep self-invented AI innovation requires, we believe, another level of selfmodification
beyond that provided by supercompilation. This other level, we believe, is best
formulated in terms of theorem-proving [RV01].
Deep self-modification could be achieved if CogPrime were capable of proving theorems of
a certain form: namely, theorems about the spacetime complexity and accuracy of particular
compound schemata, on average, assuming realistic probability distributions on the inputs, and
making appropriate independence assumptions. These are not exactly the types of theorems that
are found in human-authored mathematics papers. By and large they will be nasty, complex
theorems, not the sort that many human mathematicians enjoy proving or reading. But of
course, there is always the possibility that some elegant gem of a discovery could emerge from
this sort of highly detailed theorem-proving work.
In order to guide it in the formulation of theorems of this nature, the system will have
empirical data on the spacetime complexity of elementary schemata, and on the probability
distributions of inputs to schemata. It can embed these data in axioms, by asking: Assuming
the component elementary schemata have complexities within these bounds, and the input pdf
(probability distribution function) is between these bounds, then what is the pdf of the complexity
and accuracy of this compound schema?
Of course, this is not an easy sort of question in general: one can have schemata embodying
any sort of algorithm, including complex algorithms on which computer science professors might
write dozens of research articles. But the system must build up its ability to prove such things
incrementally, step by step.
324 18 Advanced Self-Modification: A Possible Path to Superhuman AGI
We envision teaching the system to prove theorems via a combination of supervised learning
and experiential interactive learning, using the Mizar database of mathematical theorems and
proofs (or some other similar database, if one should be created) (http://mizar.org). The
Mizar database consists of a set of “articles,” which are mathematical theorems and proofs
presented in a complex formal language. The Mizar formal language occupies a fascinating
middle ground: it is high-level enough to be viably read and written by trained humans, but
it can be unambiguously translated into simpler formal languages such as predicate logic or
Sasha.
CogPrime may be taught to prove theorems by “training” it on the Mizar theorems and
proofs, and by training it on custom-created Mizar articles specifically focusing on the sorts of
theorems useful for self-modification. Creating these articles will not be a trivial task: it will
require proving simple and then progressively more complex theorems about the probabilistic
success of CogPrime schemata, so that CogPrime can observe one’s proofs and learned from
them. Having learned from its training articles what strategies work for proving things about
simple compound schemata, it can then reason by analogy to mount attacks on slightly more
complex schemata – and so forth.
Clearly, this approach to self-modification is more difficult to achieve than the supercompilation
approach. But it is also potentially much more powerful. Even once the theorem-proving
approach is working, the supercompilation approach will still be valuable, for making incremental
improvements on existing schema, and for the peculiar creativity that is contributed when
a modified supercompiled schema is compressed back into a modified schema expression. But,
we don’t believe that supercompilation can carry out truly advanced MindAgent learning or
knowledge-representation modification. We suspect that the most advanced and ambitious goals
of self-modification probably cannot be achieved except through some variant of the theoremproving
approach. If this hypothesis is true, it means that truly advanced self-modification is
only going to come after relatively advanced theorem-proving ability. Prior to this, we will have
schema optimization, schema modification, and occasional creative schema innovation. But really
systematic, high-quality reasoning about schema, the kind that can produce an orders of
magnitude improvement in intelligence, is going to require advanced mathematical theoremproving
ability.

A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms
• Abduction: A general form of inference that goes from data describing something to a
hypothesis that accounts for the data. Often in an OpenCog context, this refers to the PLN
abduction rule, a specific First-Order PLN rule (If A implies C, and B implies C, then
maybe A is B), which embodies a simple form of abductive inference. But OpenCog may
also carry out abduction, as a general process, in other ways.
• Action Selection: The process via which the OpenCog system chooses which Schema to
enact, based on its current goals and context.
• Active Schema Pool: The set of Schema currently in the midst of Schema Execution.
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 327
• Adaptive Inference Control: Algorithms or heuristics for guiding PLN inference, that
cause inference to be guided differently based on the context in which the inference is taking
place, or based on aspects of the inference that are noted as it proceeds.
• AGI Preschool: A virtual world or robotic scenario roughly similar to the environment
within a typical human preschool, intended for AGIs to learn in via interacting with the
environment and with other intelligent agents.
• Atom: The basic entity used in OpenCog as an element for building representations. Some
Atoms directly represent patterns in the world or mind, others are components of representations.
There are two kinds of Atoms: Nodes and Links.
• Atom, Frozen: See Atom, Saved
• Atom, Realized: An Atom that exists in RAM at a certain point in time.
• Atom, Saved: An Atom that has been saved to disk or other similar media, and is not
actively being processed.
• Atom, Serialized: An Atom that is serialized for transmission from one software process
to another, or for saving to disk, etc.
• Atom2Link: A part of OpenCogPrime
s language generation system, that transforms appropriate Atoms into words connected via
link parser link types.
• Atomspace: A collection of Atoms, comprising the central part of the memory of an
OpenCog instance.
• Attention: The aspect of an intelligent system’s dynamics focused on guiding which aspects
of an OpenCog system’s memory & functionality gets more computational resources at a
certain point in time
• Attention Allocation: The cognitive process concerned with managing the parameters
and relationships guiding what the system pays attention to, at what points in time. This
is a term inclusive of Importance Updating and Hebbian Learning.
• Attentional Currency: Short Term Importance and Long Term Importance values are
implemented in terms of two different types of artificial money, STICurrency and LTICurrency.
Theoretically these may be converted to one another.
• Attentional Focus: The Atoms in an OpenCog Atomspace whose ShortTermImportance
values lie above a critical threshold (the AttentionalFocus Boundary). The Attention Allocation
subsystem treats these Atoms differently. Qualitatively, these Atoms constitute the
system’s main focus of attention during a certain interval of time, i.e. it’s a moving bubble
of attention.
• Attentional Memory: A system’s memory of what it’s useful to pay attention to, in what
contexts. In CogPrime this is managed by the attention allocation subsystem.
• Backward Chainer: A piece of software, wrapped in a MindAgent, that carries out backward
chaining inference using PLN.
• CIM-Dynamic: Concretely-Implemented Mind Dynamic, a term for a cognitive process
that is implemented explicitly in OpenCog (as opposed to allowed to emerge implicitly from
other dynamics). Sometimes a CIM-Dynamic will be implemented via a single MindAgent,
sometimes via a set of multiple interrelated MindAgents, occasionally by other means.
• Cognition: In an OpenCog context, this is an imprecise term. Sometimes this term means
any process closely related to intelligence; but more often it’s used specifically to refer to
more abstract reasoning/learning/etc, as distinct from lower-level perception and action.
• Cognitive Architecture: This refers to the logical division of an AI system like OpenCog
into interacting parts and processes representing different conceptual aspects of intelligence.
328 A Glossary
It’s different from the software architecture, though of course certain cognitive architectures
and certain software architectures fit more naturally together.
• Cognitive Cycle: The basic ”loop” of operations that an OpenCog system, used to control
an agent interacting with a world, goes through rapidly each ”subjective moment.” Typically
a cognitive cycle should be completed in a second or less. It minimally involves perceiving
data from the world, storing data in memory, and deciding what if any new actions need
to be taken based on the data perceived. It may also involve other processes like deliberative
thinking or metacognition. Not all OpenCog processing needs to take place within a
cognitive cycle.
• Cognitive Schematic: An implication of the form ”Context AND Procedure IMPLIES
goal”. Learning and utilization of these is key to CogPrime’s cognitive process.
• Cognitive Synergy: The phenomenon by which different cognitive processes, controlling a
single agent, work together in such a way as to help each other be more intelligent. Typically,
if one has cognitive processes that are individually susceptible to combinatorial explosions,
cognitive synergy involves coupling them together in such a way that they can help one
another overcome each other’s internal combinatorial explosions. The CogPrime design is
reliant on the hypothesis that its key learning algorithms will display dramatic cognitive
synergy when utilized for agent control in appropriate environments.
• CogPrime : The name for the AGI design presented in this book, which is designed specifically
for implementation within the OpenCog software framework (and this implementation
is OpenCogPrime).
• CogServer: A piece of software, within OpenCog, that wraps up an Atomspace and a
number of MindAgents, along with other mechanisms like a Scheduler for controlling the
activity of the MindAgents, and code for important and exporting data from the Atomspace.
• Cognitive Equation: The principle, identified in Ben Goertzel’s 1994 book "Chaotic
Logic", that minds are collections of pattern-recognition elements, that work by iteratively
recognizing patterns in each other and then embodying these patterns as new system elements.
This is seen as distinguishing mind from ”self-organization” in general, as the latter
is not so focused on continual pattern recognition. Colloquially this means that ”a mind is
a system continually creating itself via recognizing patterns in itself.”
• Combo: The programming language used internally by MOSES to represent the programs
it evolves. SchemaNodes may refer to Combo programs, whether the latter are learned via
MOSES or via some other means. The textual realization of Combo resembles LISP with
less syntactic sugar. Internally a Combo program is represented as a program tree.
• Composer: In the PLN design, a rule is denoted a composer if it needs premises for
generating its consequent. See generator.
• CogBuntu: an Ubuntu Linux remix that contains all required packages and tools to test
and develop OpenCog.
• Concept Creation: A general term for cognitive processes that create new ConceptNodes,
PredicateNodes or concept maps representing new concepts.
• Conceptual Blending: A process of creating new concepts via judiciously combining
pieces of old concepts. This may occur in OpenCog in many ways, among them the explicit
use of a ConceptBlending MindAgent, that blends two or more ConceptNodes into a new
one.
• Confidence: A component of an OpenCog/PLN TruthValue, which is a scaling into the
interval [0,1] of the weight of evidence associated with a truth value. In the simplest case
(of a probabilistic Simple Truth Value), one uses confidence c = n / (n+k), where n is
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 329
the weight of evidence and k is a parameter. In the case of an Indefinite Truth Value, the
confidence is associated with the width of the probability interval.
• Confidence Decay: The process by which the confidence of an Atom decreases over time,
as the observations on which the Atom’s truth value is based become increasingly obsolete.
This may be carried out by a special MindAgent. The rate of confidence decay is subtle and
contextually determined, and must be estimated via inference rather than simply assumed
a priori.
• Consciousness: CogPrime is not predicated on any particular conceptual theory of consciousness.
Informally, the AttentionalFocus is sometimes referred to as the ”conscious”
mind of a CogPrime system, with the rest of the Atomspace as ”unconscious” but this is
just an informal usage, not intended to tie the CogPrime design to any particular theory of
consciousness. The primary originator of the CogPrime
design (Ben Goertzel) tends toward panpsychism, as it happens.
• Context: In addition to its general common-sensical meaning, in CogPrime the term Context
also refers to an Atom that is used as the first argument of a ContextLink. The second
argument of the ContextLink then contains Links or Nodes, with TruthValues calculated
restricted to the context defined by the first argument. For instance, (ContextLink USA
(InheritanceLink person obese )).
• Core: The MindOS portion of OpenCog, comprising the Atomspace, the CogServer, and
other associated ”infrastructural” code.
• Corrective Learning: When an agent learns how to do something, by having another
agent explicitly guide it in doing the thing. For instance, teaching a dog to sit by pushing
its butt to the ground.
• CSDLN: (Compositional Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Network): A hierarchical pattern
recognition network, in which each layer corresponds to a certain spatiotemporal granularity,
the nodes on a given layer correspond to spatiotemporal regions of a given size, and the
children of a node correspond to sub-regions of the region the parent corresponds to. Jeff
Hawkins’s HTM is one example CSDLN, and Itamar Arel’s DeSTIN (currently used in
OpenCog) is another.
• Declarative Knowledge: Semantic knowledge as would be expressed in propositional or
predicate logic facts or beliefs.
• Deduction: In general, this refers to the derivation of conclusions from premises using
logical rules. In PLN in particular, this often refers to the exercise of a specific inference
rule, the PLN Deduction rule (A → B, B → C, therefore A→ C)
• Deep Learning: Learning in a network of elements with multiple layers, involving feedforward
and feedback dynamics, and adaptation of the links between the elements. An example
deep learning algorithm is DeSTIN, which is being integrated with OpenCog for perception
processing.
• Defrosting: Restoring, into the RAM portion of an Atomspace, an Atom (or set thereof)
previously saved to disk.
• Demand: In CogPrime’s OpenPsi subsystem, this term is used in a manner inherited from
the Psi model of motivated action. A Demand in this context is a quantity whose value the
system is motivated to adjust. Typically the system wants to keep the Demand between
certain minimum and maximum values. An Urge develops when a Demand deviates from
its target range.
• Deme: In MOSES, an ”island” of candidate programs, closely clustered together in program
space, being evolved in an attempt to optimize a certain fitness function. The idea is that
330 A Glossary
within a deme, programs are generally similar enough that reasonable syntax-semantics
correlation obtains.
• Derived Hypergraph: The SMEPH hypergraph obtained via modeling a system in terms
of a hypergraph representing its internal states and their relationships. For instance, a
SMEPH vertex represents a collection of internal states that habitually occur in relation to
similar external situations. A SMEPH edge represents a relationship between two SMEPH
vertices (e.g. a similarity or inheritance relationship). The terminology ”edge /vertex” is
used in this context, to distinguish from the ”link / node” terminology used in the context
of the Atomspace.
• DeSTIN – Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network: A specific CSDLN created by
Itamar Arel, tested on visual perception, and appropriate for integration within CogPrime.
• Dialogue: Linguistic interaction between two or more parties. In a CogPrime context, this
may be in English or another natural language, or it may be in Lojban or Psynese.
• Dialogue Control: The process of determining what to say at each juncture in a dialogue.
This is distinguished from the linguistic aspects of dialogue, language comprehension and
language generation. Dialogue control applies to Psynese or Lojban, as well as to human
natural language.
• Dimensional Embedding: The process of embedding entities from some non-dimensional
space (e.g. the Atomspace) into an n-dimensional Euclidean space. This can be useful in an
AI context because some sorts of queries (e.g. ”find everything similar to X”, ”find a path
between X and Y”) are much faster to carry out among points in a Euclidean space, than
among entities in a space with less geometric structure.
• Distributed Atomspace: An implementation of an Atomspace that spans multiple computational
processes; generally this is done to enable spreading an Atomspace across multiple
machines.
• Dual Network: A network of mental or informational entities with both a hierarchical
structure and a heterarchical structure, and an alignment among the two structures so that
each one helps with the maintenance of the other. This is hypothesized to be a critical
emergent structure, that must emerge in a mind (e.g. in an Atomspace) in order for it to
achieve a reasonable level of human-like general intelligence (and possibly to achieve a high
level of pragmatic general intelligence in any physical environment).
• Efficient Pragmatic General Intelligence: A formal, mathematical definition of general
intelligence (extending the pragmatic general intelligence), that ultimately boils down to:
the ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments using limited computational
resources (where there is a specifically given weighting function determining which goals
and environments have highest priority). More specifically, the definition weighted-sums the
system’s normalized goal-achieving ability over (goal, environment pairs), and where the
weights are given by some assumed measure over (goal, environment pairs), and where the
normalization is done via dividing by the (space and time) computational resources used
for achieving the goal.
• Elegant Normal Form (ENF): Used in MOSES, this is a way of putting programs in
a normal form while retaining their hierarchical structure. This is critical if one wishes
to probabilistically model the structure of a collection of programs, which is a meaningful
operation if the collection of programs is operating within a region of program space where
syntax-semantics correlation holds to a reasonable degree. The Reduct library is used to
place programs into ENF.
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 331
• Embodied Communication Prior: The class of prior distributions over (goal, environment
pairs), that are imposed by placing an intelligent system in an environment where
most of its tasks involve controlling a spatially localized body in a complex world, and interacting
with other intelligent spatially localized bodies. It is hypothesized that many key
aspects of human-like intelligence (e.g. the use of different subsystems for different memory
types, and cognitive synergy between the dynamics associated with these subsystems) are
consequences of this prior assumption. This is related to the Mind-World Correspondence
Principle.
• Embodiment: Colloquially, in an OpenCog context, this usually means the use of an AI
software system to control a spatially localized body in a complex (usually 3D) world. There
are also possible ”borderline cases” of embodiment, such as a search agent on the Internet.
In a sense any AI is embodied, because it occupies some physical system (e.g. computer
hardware) and has some way of interfacing with the outside world.
• Emergence: A property or pattern in a system is emergent if it arises via the combination
of other system components or aspects, in such a way that its details would be very difficult
(not necessarily impossible in principle) to predict from these other system components or
aspects.
• Emotion: Emotions are system-wide responses to the system’s current and predicted state.
Dorner’s Psi theory of emotion contains explanations of many human emotions in terms
of underlying dynamics and motivations, and most of these explanations make sense in a
CogPrime context, due to CogPrime’s use of OpenPsi (modeled on Psi) for motivation and
action selection.
• Episodic Knowledge: Knowledge about episodes in an agent’s life-history, or the lifehistory
of other agents. CogPrime includes a special dimensional embedding space only for
episodic knowledge, easing organization and recall.
• Evolutionary Learning: Learning that proceeds via the rough process of iterated differential
reproduction based on fitness, incorporating variations of reproduced entities. MOSES
is an explicitly evolutionary-learning-based portion of CogPrime; but CogPrime’s dynamics
as a whole may also be conceived as evolutionary.
• Exemplar: (in the context of imitation learning) - When the owner wants to teach an
OpenCog controlled agent a behavior by imitation, he/she gives the pet an exemplar. To
teach a virtual pet "fetch" for instance, the owner is going to throw a stick, run to it, grab
it with his/her mouth and come back to its initial position.
• Exemplar: (in the context of MOSES) – Candidate chosen as the core of a new deme, or
as the central program within a deme, to be varied by representation building for ongoing
exploration of program space.
• Explicit Knowledge Representation: Knowledge representation in which individual,
easily humanly identifiable pieces of knowledge correspond to individual elements in a knowledge
store (elements that are explicitly there in the software and accessible via very rapid,
deterministic operations)
• Extension: In PLN, the extension of a node refers to the instances of the category that
the node represents. In contrast is the intension.
• Fishgram (Frequent and Interesting Sub-hypergraph Mining): A pattern mining
algorithm for identifying frequent and/or interesting sub-hypergraphs in the Atomspace.
• First-Order Inference (FOI): The subset of PLN that handles Logical Links not involving
VariableAtoms or higher-order functions. The other aspect of PLN, Higher-Order
Inference, uses Truth Value formulas derived from First-Order Inference.
332 A Glossary
• Forgetting: The process of removing Atoms from the in-RAM portion of Atomspace, when
RAM gets short and they are judged not as valuable to retain in RAM as other Atoms. This
is commonly done using the LTI values of the Atoms (removing lowest LTI-Atoms, or more
complex strategies involving the LTI of groups of interconnected Atoms). May be done by
a dedicated Forgetting MindAgent. VLTI may be used to determine the fate of forgotten
Atoms.
• Forward Chainer: A control mechanism (MindAgent) for PLN inference, that works by
taking existing Atoms and deriving conclusions from them using PLN rules, and then iterating
this process. The goal is to derive new Atoms that are interesting according to some
given criterion.
• Frame2Atom: A simple system of hand-coded rules for translating the output of RelEx2Frame
(logical representation of semantic relationships using FrameNet relationships) into Atoms.
• Freezing: Saving Atoms from the in-RAM Atomspace to disk.
• General Intelligence: Often used in an informal, commonsensical sense, to mean the
ability to learn and generalize beyond specific problems or contexts. Has been formalized
in various ways as well, including formalizations of the notion of ”achieving complex goals
in complex environments” and ”achieving complex goals in complex environments using
limited resources.” Usually interpreted as a fuzzy concept, according to which absolutely
general intelligence is physically unachievable, and humans have a significant level of general
intelligence, but far from the maximally physically achievable degree.
• Generalized Hypergraph: A hypergraph with some additional features, such as links
that point to links, and nodes that are seen as ”containing” whole sub-hypergraphs. This is
the most natural and direct way to mathematically/visually model the Atomspace.
• Generator: In the PLN design, a rule is denoted a generator if it can produce its consequent
without needing premises (e.g. LookupRule, which just looks it up in the AtomSpace). See
composer.
• Global, Distributed Memory: Memory that stores items as implicit knowledge, with
each memory item spread across multiple components, stored as a pattern of organization
or activity among them.
• Glocal Memory: The storage of items in memory in a way that involves both localized
and global, distributed aspects.
• Goal: An Atom representing a function that a system (like OpenCog) is supposed to spend
a certain non-trivial percentage of its attention optimizing. The goal, informally speaking,
is to maximize the Atom’s truth value.
• Goal, Implicit: A goal that an intelligent system, in practice, strives to achieve; but that
is not explicitly represented as a goal in the system’s knowledge base.
• Goal, Explicit: A goal that an intelligent system explicitly represents in its knowledge
base, and expends some resources trying to achieve. Goal Nodes (which may be Nodes or,
e.g. ImplicationLinks) are used for this purpose in OpenCog.
• Goal-Driven Learning: Learning that is driven by the cognitive schematic i.e. by the quest
of figuring out which procedures can be expected to achieve a certain goal in a certain sort
of context.
• Grounded SchemaNode: See SchemaNode, Grounded.
• Hebbian Learning: An aspect of Attention Allocation, centered on creating and updating
HebbianLinks, which represent the simultaneous importance of the Atoms joined by the
HebbianLink.
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 333
• Hebbian Links: Links recording information about the associative relationship (cooccurrence)
between Atoms. These include symmetric and asymmetric HebbianLinks.
• Heterarchical Network: A network of linked elements in which the semantic relationships
associated with the links are generally symmetrical (e.g. they may be similarity links, or
symmetrical associative links). This is one important sort of subnetwork of an intelligent
system; see Dual Network.
• Hierarchical Network: A network of linked elements in which the semantic relationships
associated with the links are generally asymmetrical, and the parent nodes of a node have
a more general scope and some measure of control over their children (though there may be
important feedback dynamics too). This is one important sort of subnetwork of an intelligent
system; see Dual Network.
• Higher-Order Inference (HOI): PLN inference involving variables or higher-order functions.
In contrast to First-Order Inference (FOI).
• Hillclimbing: A general term for greedy, local optimization techniques, including some
relatively sophisticated ones that involve ”mildly nonlocal” jumps.
• Human-Level Intelligence: General intelligence that’s ”as smart as” human general intelligence,
even if in some respects quite unlike human intelligence. An informal concept,
which generally doesn’t come up much in CogPrime work, but is used frequently by some
other AI theorists.
• Human-Like Intelligence: General intelligence with properties and capabilities broadly
resembling those of humans, but not necessarily precisely imitating human beings.
• Hypergraph: A conventional hypergraph is a collection of nodes and links, where each
link may span any number of nodes. OpenCog makes use of generalized hypergraphs (the
Atomspace is one of these).
• Imitation Learning: Learning via copying what some other agent is observed to do.
• Implication: Often refers to an ImplicationLink between two PredicateNodes, indicating
an (extensional, intensional or mixed) logical implication.
• Implicit Knowledge Representation: Representation of knowledge via having easily
humanly identifiable pieces of knowledge correspond to the pattern of organization and/or
dynamics of elements, rather than via having individual elements correspond to easily humanly
identifiable pieces of knowledge.
• Importance: A generic term for the Attention Values associated with Atoms. Most commonly
these are STI (short term importance) and LTI (long term importance) values. Other
importance values corresponding to various different time scales are also possible. In general
an importance value reflects an estimate of the likelihood an Atom will be useful to the
system over some particular future time-horizon. STI is generally relevant to processor time
allocation, whereas LTI is generally relevant to memory allocation.
• Importance Decay: The process of Atom importance values (e.g. STI and LTI) decreasing
over time, if the Atoms are not utilized. Importance decay rates may in general be contextdependent.
• Importance Spreading: A synonym for Importance Updating, intended to highlight the
similarity with ”activation spreading” in neural and semantic networks.
• Importance Updating: The CIM-Dynamic that periodically (frequently) updates the STI
and LTI values of Atoms based on their recent activity and their relationships.
• Imprecise Truth Value: Peter Walley’s imprecise truth values are intervals [L,U], interpreted
as lower and upper bounds of the means of probability distributions in an envelope
334 A Glossary
of distributions. In general, the term may be used to refer to any truth value involving
intervals or related constructs, such as indefinite probabilities.
• Indefinite Probability: An extension of a standard imprecise probability, comprising a
credible interval for the means of probability distributions governed by a given second-order
distribution.
• Indefinite Truth Value: An OpenCog TruthValue object wrapping up an indefinite probability
• Induction: In PLN, a specific inference rule (A → B, A → C, therefore B → C). In general,
the process of heuristically inferring that what has been seen in multiple examples, will be
seen again in new examples. Induction in the broad sense, may be carried out in OpenCog
by methods other than PLN induction. When emphasis needs to be laid on the particular
PLN inference rule, the phrase ”PLN Induction” is used.
• Inference: Generally speaking, the process of deriving conclusions from assumptions. In
an OpenCog context, this often refers to the PLN inference system. Inference in the broad
sense is distinguished from general learning via some specific characteristics, such as the
intrinsically incremental nature of inference: it proceeds step by step.
• Inference Control: A cognitive process that determines what logical inference rule (e.g.
what PLN rule) is applied to what data, at each point in the dynamic operation of an
inference process.
• Integrative AGI: An AGI architecture, like CogPrime, that relies on a number of different
powerful, reasonably general algorithms all cooperating together. This is different from an
AGI architecture that is centered on a single algorithm, and also different than an AGI
architecture that expects intelligent behavior to emerge from the collective interoperation
of a number of simple elements (without any sophisticated algorithms coordinating their
overall behavior).
• Integrative Cognitive Architecture: A cognitive architecture intended to support integrative
AGI.
• Intelligence: An informal, natural language concept. ”General intelligence” is one slightly
more precise specification of a related concept; ”Universal intelligence” is a fully precise
specification of a related concept. Other specifications of related concepts made in the
particular context of CogPrime research are the pragmatic general intelligence and the
efficient pragmatic general intelligence.
• Intension: In PLN, the intention of a node consists of Atoms representing properties of
the entity the node represents.
• Intentional memory: A system’s knowledge of its goals and their subgoals, and associations
between these goals and procedures and contexts (e.g. cognitive schematics).
• Internal Simulation World: A simulation engine used to simulate an external environment
(which may be physical or virtual), used by an AGI system as its ”mind’s eye” in order
to experiment with various action‘ q sequences and envision their consequences, or observe
the consequences of various hypothetical situations. Particularly important for dealing with
episodic knowledge.
• Interval Algebra: Allen Interval Algebra, a mathematical theory of the relationships between
time intervals. CogPrime utilizes a fuzzified version of classic Interval Algebra.
• IRC Learning (Imitation, Reinforcement, Correction): Learning via interaction with
a teacher, involving a combination of imitating the teacher, getting explicit reinforcement
signals from the teacher, and having one’s incorrect or suboptimal behaviors guided toward
betterness by the teacher in real-time. This is a large part of how young humans learn.
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 335
• Knowledge Base: A shorthand for the totality of knowledge possessed by an intelligent
system during a certain interval of time (whether or not this knowledge is explicitly represented).
Put differently: this is an intelligence’s total memory contents (inclusive of all
types of memory) during an interval of time.
• Language Comprehension: The process of mapping natural language speech or text into
a more ”cognitive”, largely language-independent representation. In OpenCog this has been
done by various pipelines consisting of dedicated natural language processing tools, e.g. a
pipeline: text → Link Parser → RelEx → RelEx2Frame → Frame2Atom Atomspace; and
alternatively a pipeline Link Parser → Link2Atom → Atomspace. It would also be possible
to do language comprehension purely via PLN and other generic OpenCog processes,
without using specialized language processing tools.
• Language Generation: The process of mapping (largely language-independent) cognitive
content into speech or text. In OpenCog this has been done by various pipelines consisting of
dedicated natural language processing tools, e.g. a pipeline: Atomspace → NLGen → text;
or more recently Atomspace → Atom2Link → surface realization → text. It would also be
possible to do language generation purely via PLN and other generic OpenCog processes,
without using specialized language processing tools.
• Language Processing: Processing of human language is decomposed, in CogPrime, into
Language Comprehension, Language Generation, and Dialogue Control.
• Learning: In general, the process of a system adapting based on experience, in a way that
increases its intelligence (its ability to achieve its goals). The theory underlying CogPrime
doesn’t distinguish learning from reasoning, associating, or other aspects of intelligence.
• Learning Server: In some OpenCog configurations, this refers to a software server that
performs ”offline” learning tasks (e.g. using MOSES or hillclimbing), and is in communication
with an Operational Agent Controller software server that performs real-time agent
control and dispatches learning tasks to and receives results from the Learning Server.
• Linguistic Links: A catch-all term for Atoms explicitly representing linguistic content,
e.g. WordNode, SentenceNode, CharacterNode.
• Link: A type of Atom, representing a relationship among one or more Atoms. Links and
Nodes are the two basic kinds of Atoms.
• Link Parser: A natural language syntax parser, created by Sleator and Temperley at
Carnegie-Mellon University, and currently used as part of OpenCogPrime’s natural language
comprehension and natural language generation system.
• Link2Atom: A system for translating link parser links into Atoms. It attempts to resolve
precisely as much ambiguity as needed in order to translate a given assemblage of link parser
links into a unique Atom structure.
• Lobe: A term sometimes used to refer to a portion of a distributed Atomspace that lives
in a single computational process. Often different lobes will live on different machines.
• Localized Memory: Memory that stores each item using a small number of closelyconnected
elements.
• Logic: In an OpenCog context, this usually refers to a set of formal rules for translating
certain combinations of Atoms into ”conclusion” Atoms. The paradigm case at present is the
PLN probabilistic logic system, but OpenCog can also be used together with other logics.
• Logical Links: Any Atoms whose truth values are primarily determined or adjusted via
logical rules, e.g. PLN’s InheritanceLink, SimilarityLink, ImplicationLink, etc. The term
isn’t usually applied to other links like HebbianLinks whose semantics isn’t primarily logic-
336 A Glossary
based, even though these other links can be processed via (e.g. PLN) logical inference via
interpreting them logically.
• Lojban: A constructed human language, with a completely formalized syntax and a highly
formalized semantics, and a small but active community of speakers. In principle this seems
an extremely good method for communication between humans and early-stage AGI systems.
• Lojban++: A variant of Lojban that incorporates English words, enabling more flexible
expression without the need for frequent invention of new Lojban words.
• Long Term Importance (LTI): A value associated with each Atom, indicating roughly
the expected utility to the system of keeping that Atom in RAM rather than saving it to
disk or deleting it. It’s possible to have multiple LTI values pertaining to different time
scales, but so far practical implementation and most theory has centered on the option of
a single LTI value.
• LTI: Long Term Importance
• Map: A collection of Atoms that are interconnected in such a way that they tend to be
commonly active (i.e. to have high STI, e.g. enough to be in the AttentionalFocus, at the
same time).
• Map Encapsulation: The process of automatically identifying maps in the Atomspace,
and creating Atoms that ”encapsulate” them; the Atom encapsulation a map would link to
all the Atoms in the map. This is a way of making global memory into local memory, thus
making the system’s memory glocal and explicitly manifesting the ”cognitive equation.”
This may be carried out via a dedicated MapEncapsulation MindAgent.
• Map Formation: The process via which maps form in the Atomspace. This need not be
explicit; maps may form implicitly via the action of Hebbian Learning. It will commonly
occur that Atoms frequently co-occurring in the AttentionalFocus, will come to be joined
together in a map.
• Memory Types: In CogPrime
this generally refers to the different types of memory that are embodied in different data
structures or processes in the CogPrime
architecture, e.g. declarative (semantic), procedural, attentional, intentional, episodic, sensorimotor.
• Mind-World Correspondence Principle: The principle that, for a mind to display
efficient pragmatic general intelligence relative to a world, it should display many of the
same key structural properties as that world. This can be formalized by modeling the world
and mind as probabilistic state transition graphs, and saying that the categories implicit
in the state transition graphs of the mind and world should be inter-mappable via a highprobability
morphism.
• Mind OS: A synonym for the OpenCog Core.
• MindAgent: An OpenCog software object, residing in the CogServer, that carries out
some processes in interaction with the Atomspace. A given conceptual cognitive process
(e.g. PLN inference, Attention allocation, etc.) may be carried out by a number of different
MindAgents designed to work together.
• Mindspace: A model of the set of states of an intelligent system as a geometrical space,
imposed by assuming some metric on the set of mind-states. This may be used as a tool for
formulating general principles about the dynamics of generally intelligent systems.
• Modulators: Parameters in the Psi model of motivated, emotional cognition, that modulate
the way a system perceives, reasons about and interacts with the world.
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 337
• MOSES (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search): An algorithm for procedure
learning, which in the current implementation learns programs in the Combo language.
MOSES is an evolutionary learning system, which differs from typical genetic programming
systems in multiple aspects including: a subtler framework for managing multiple ”demes”
or ”islands” of candidate programs; a library called Reduct for placing programs in Elegant
Normal Form; and the use of probabilistic modeling in place of, or in addition to, mutation
and crossover as means of determining which new candidate programs to try.
• Motoric: Pertaining to the control of physical actuators, e.g. those connected to a robot.
May sometimes be used to refer to the control of movements of a virtual character as well.
• Moving Bubble of Attention: The Attentional Focus of a CogPrime system.
• Natural Language Comprehension: See Language Comprehension
• Natural Language Generation: See Language Generation
• Natural Language Processing (NLP): See Language Processing
• NLGen: Software for carrying out the surface realization phase of natural language generation,
via translating collections of RelEx output relationships into English sentences.
Was made functional for simple sentences and some complex sentences; not currently under
active development, as work has shifted to the related Atom2Link approach to language
generation.
• Node: A type of Atom. Links and Nodes are the two basic kinds of Atoms. Nodes, mathematically,
can be thought of as "0-ary" links. Some types of Nodes refer to external or
mathematical entities (e.g. WordNode, NumberNode); others are purely abstract, e.g. a
ConceptNode is characterized purely by the Links relating it to other atoms. Grounded-
PredicateNodes and GroundedSchemaNodes connect to explicitly represented procedures
(sometimes in the Combo language); ungrounded PredicateNodes and SchemaNodes are
abstract and, like ConceptNodes, purely characterized by their relationships.
• Node Probability: Many PLN inference rules rely on probabilities associated with Nodes.
Node probabilities are often easiest to interpret in a specific context, e.g. the probability
P(cat) makes obvious sense in the context of a typical American house, or in the context
of the center of the sun. Without any contextual specification, P(A) is taken to mean
the probability that a randomly chosen occasion of the system’s experience includes some
instance of A.
• Novamente Cognition Engine (NCE): A proprietary proto-AGI software system, the
predecessor to OpenCog. Many parts of the NCE were open-sourced to form portions of
OpenCog, but some NCE code was not included in OpenCog; and now OpenCog includes
multiple aspects and plenty of code that was not in NCE.
• OpenCog: A software framework intended for development of AGI systems, and also for
narrow-AI application using tools that have AGI applications. Co-designed with the Cog-
Prime cognitive architecture, but not exclusively bound to it.
• OpenCog Prime (OCP): The implementation of the CogPrime cognitive architecture
within the OpenCog software framework.
• OpenPsi: CogPrime’s architecture for motivation-driven action selection, which is based
on adapting Dorner’s Psi model for use in the OpenCog framework.
• Operational Agent Controller (OAC): In some OpenCog configurations, this is a software
server containing a CogServer devoted to real-time control of an agent (e.g. a virtual
world agent, or a robot). Background, offline learning tasks may then be dispatched to other
software processes, e.g. to a Learning Server.
338 A Glossary
• Pattern: In a CogPrime context, the term ”pattern” is generally used to refer to a process
that produces some entity, and is judged simpler than that entity.
• Pattern Mining: Pattern mining is the process of extracting an (often large) number of
patterns from some body of information, subject to some criterion regarding which patterns
are of interest. Often (but not exclusively) it refers to algorithms that are rapid or ”greedy”,
finding a large number of simple patterns relatively inexpensively.
• Pattern Recognition: The process of identifying and representing a pattern in some
substrate (e.g. some collection of Atoms, or some raw perceptual data, etc.).
• Patternism: The philosophical principle holding that, from the perspective of engineering
intelligent systems, it is sufficient and useful to think about mental processes in terms of
(static and dynamical) patterns.
• Perception: The process of understanding data from sensors. When natural language is
ingested in textual format, this is generally not considered perceptual. Perception may be
taken to encompass both pre-processing that prepares sensory data for ingestion into the
Atomspace, processing via specialized perception processing systems like DeSTIN that are
connected to the Atomspace, and more cognitive-level process within the Atomspace that
is oriented toward understanding what has been sensed.
• Piagetan Stages: A series of stages of cognitive development hypothesized by developmental
psychologist Jean Piaget, which are easy to interpret in the context of developing
CogPrime systems. The basic stages are: Infantile, Pre-operational, Concrete Operational
and Formal. Post-formal stages have been discussed by theorists since Piaget and seem
relevant to AGI, especially advanced AGI systems capable of strong self-modification.
• PLN: short for Probabilistic Logic Networks
• PLN, First-Order: See First-Order Inference
• PLN, Higher-Order: See Higher-Order Inference
• PLN Rules: A PLN Rule takes as input one or more Atoms (the ”premises”, usually Links),
and output an Atom that is a ”logical conclusion” of those Atoms. The truth value of the
consequence is determined by a PLN Formula associated with the Rule.
• PLN Formulas: A PLN Formula, corresponding to a PLN Rule, takes the TruthValues
corresponding to the premises and produces the TruthValue corresponding to the conclusion.
A single Rule may correspond to multiple Formulas, where each Formula deals with a
different sort of TruthValue.
• Pragmatic General Intelligence: A formalization of the concept of general intelligence,
based on the concept that general intelligence is the capability to achieve goals in environments,
calculated as a weighted average over some fuzzy set of goals and environments.
• Predicate Evaluation: The process of determining the Truth Value of a predicate, embodied
in a PredicateNode. This may be recursive, as the predicate referenced internally by a
Grounded PredicateNode (and represented via a Combo program tree) may itself internally
reference other PredicateNodes.
• Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN): A mathematical and conceptual framework for
reasoning under uncertainty, integrating aspects of predicate and term logic with extensions
of imprecise probability theory. OpenCogPrime’s central tool for symbolic reasoning.
• Procedural Knowledge: Knowledge regarding which series of actions (or action-combinations)
are useful for an agent to undertake in which circumstances. In CogPrime these may be
learned in a number of ways, e.g. via PLN or via Hebbian learning of Schema Maps, or via
explicit learning of Combo programs via MOSES or hillclimbing. Procedures are represented
as SchemaNodes or Schema Maps.
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 339
• Procedure Evaluation/Execution: A general term encompassing both Schema Execution
and Predicate Evaluation, both of which are similar computational processes involving
manipulation of Combo trees associated with ProcedureNodes.
• Procedure Learning: Learning of procedural knowledge, based on any method, e.g. evolutionary
learning (e.g. MOSES), inference (e.g. PLN), reinforcement learning (e.g. Hebbian
learning).
• Procedure Node: A SchemaNode or PredicateNode
• Psi: A model of motivated action and emotion, originated by Dietrich Dorner and further
developed by Joscha Bach, who incorporated it in his proto-AGI system MicroPsi. OpenCog-
Prime’s motivated-action component, OpenPsi, is roughly based on the Psi model.
• Psynese: A system enabling different OpenCog instances to communicate without using
natural language, via directly exchanging Atom subgraphs, using a special system to map
references in the speaker’s mind into matching references in the listener’s mind.
• Psynet Model: An early version of the theory of mind underlying CogPrime, referred to
in some early writings on the Webmind AI Engine and Novamente Cognition Engine. The
concepts underlying the psynet model are still part of the theory underlying CogPrime, but
the name has been deprecated as it never really caught on.
• Reasoning: See inference
• Reduct: A code library, used within MOSES, applying a collection of hand-coded rewrite
rules that transform Combo programs into Elegant Normal Form.
• Region Connection Calculus: A mathematical formalism describing a system of basic
operations among spatial regions. Used in CogPrime as part of spatial inference to provide
relations and rules to be referenced via PLN and potentially other subsystems.
• Reinforcement Learning: Learning procedures via experience, in a manner explicitly
guided to cause the learning of procedures that will maximize the system’s expected future
reward. CogPrime does this implicitly whenever it tries to learn procedures that will maximize
some Goal whose Truth Value is estimated via an expected reward calculation (where
”reward” may mean simply the Truth Value of some Atom defined as ”reward”). Goal-driven
learning is more general than reinforcement learning as thus defined; and the learning that
CogPrime does, which is only partially goal-driven, is yet more general.
• RelEx: A software system used in OpenCog as part of natural language comprehension, to
map the output of the link parser into more abstract semantic relationships. These more
abstract relationships may then be entered directly into the Atomspace, or they may be
further abstracted before being entered into the Atomspace, e.g. by RelEx2Frame rules.
• RelEx2Frame: A system of rules for translating RelEx output into Atoms, based on the
FrameNet ontology. The output of the RelEx2Frame rules make use of the FrameNet library
of semantic relationships. The current (2012) RelEx2Frame rule-based is problematic and
the RelEx2Frame system is deprecated as a result, in favor of Link2Atom. However, the
ideas embodied in these rules may be useful; if cleaned up the rules might profitably be
ported into the Atomspace as ImplicationLinks.
• Representation Building: A stage within MOSES, wherein a candidate Combo program
tree (within a deme) is modified by replacing one or more tree nodes with alternative tree
nodes, thus obtaining a new, different candidate program within that deme. This process
currently relies on hand-coded knowledge regarding which types of tree nodes a given tree
node should be experimentally replaced with (e.g. an AND node might sensibly be replaced
with an OR node, but not so sensibly replaced with a node representing a ”kick” action).
340 A Glossary
• Request for Services (RFS): In CogPrime’s Goal-driven action system, a RFS is a
package sent from a Goal Atom to another Atom, offering it a certain amount of STI
currency if it is able to deliver the goal what it wants (an increase in its Truth Value).
RFS’s may be passed on, e.g. from goals to subgoals to sub-subgoals, but eventually an
RFS reaches a Grounded SchemaNode, and when the corresponding Schema is executed,
the payment implicit in the RFS is made.
• Robot Preschool: An AGI Preschool in our physical world, intended for robotically embodied
AGIs.
• Robotic Embodiment: Using an AGI to control a robot. The AGI may be running on
hardware physically contained in the robot, or may run elsewhere and control the robot via
networking methods such as wifi.
• Scheduler: Part of the CogServer that controls which processes (e.g. which MindAgents)
get processor time, at which point in time.
• Schema: A ”script” describing a process to be carried out. This may be explicit, as in the
case of a GroundedSchemaNode, or implicit, as the case in Schema maps or ungrounded
SchemaNodes.
• Schema Encapsulation: The process of automatically recognizing a Schema Map in an
Atomspace, and creating a Combo (or other) program embodying the process carried out
by this Schema Map, and then storing this program in the Procedure Repository and
associating it with a particular SchemaNode. This translates distributed, global procedural
memory into localized procedural memory. It’s a special case of Map Encapsulation.
• Schema Execution: The process of ”running” a Grounded Schema, similar to running a
computer program. Or, phrased alternately: The process of executing the Schema referenced
by a Grounded SchemaNode. This may be recursive, as the predicate referenced internally by
a Grounded SchemaNode (and represented via a Combo program tree) may itself internally
reference other Grounded SchemaNodes.
• Schema, Grounded: A Schema that is associated with a specific executable program
(either a Combo program or, say, C++ code)
• Schema Map: A collection of Atoms, including SchemaNodes, that tend to be enacted
in a certain order (or set of orders), thus habitually enacting the same process. This is a
distributed, globalized way of storing and enacting procedures.
• Schema, Ungrounded: A Schema that represents an abstract procedure, not associated
with any particular executable program.
• Schematic Implication: A general, conceptual name for implications of the form ((Context
AND Procedure) IMPLIES Goal)
• SegSim: A name for the main algorithm underlying the NLGen language generation software.
The algorithm is based on segmenting a collection of Atoms into small parts, and
matching each part against memory to find, for each part, cases where similar Atomcollections
already have known linguistic expression.
• Self-Modification: A term generally used for AI systems that can purposefully modify
their core algorithms and representations. Formally and crisply distinguishing this sort of
”strong self-modification” from ”mere” learning is a tricky matter.
• Sensorimotor: Pertaining to sensory data, motoric actions, and their combination and
intersection.
• Sensory: Pertaining to data received by the AGI system from the outside world. In a
CogPrime system that perceives language directly as text, the textual input will generally
A.2 Glossary of Specialized Terms 341
not be considered as ”sensory” (on the other hand, speech audio data would be considered
as ”sensory”).
• Short Term Importance: A value associated with each Atom, indicating roughly the
expected utility to the system of keeping that Atom in RAM rather than saving it to disk
or deleting it. It’s possible to have multple LTI values pertaining to different time scales,
but so far practical implementation and most theory has centered on the option of a single
LTI value.
• Similarity: a link type indicating the probabilistic similarity between two different Atoms.
Generically this is a combination of Intensional Similarity (similarity of properties) and
Extensional Similarity (similarity of members).
• Simple Truth Value: a TruthValue involving a pair (s,d) indicating strength (e.g. probability
or fuzzy set membership) and confidence d. d may be replaced by other options such
as a count n or a weight of evidence w.
• Simulation World: See Internal Simulation World
• SMEPH (Self-Modifying Evolving Probabilistic Hypergraphs): a style of modeling
systems, in which each system is associated with a derived hypergraph
• SMEPH Edge: A link in a SMEPH derived hypergraph, indicating an empirically observed
relationship (e.g. inheritance or similarity) between two
• SMEPH Vertex: A node in a SMEPH derived hypergraph representing a system, indicating
a collection of system states empirically observed to arise in conjunction with the same
external stimuli
• Spatial Inference: PLN reasoning including Atoms that explicitly reference spatial relationships
• Spatiotemporal Inference: PLN reasoning including Atoms that explicitly reference spatial
and temporal relationships
• STI: Shorthand for Short Term Importance
• Strength: The main component of a TruthValue object, lying in the interval [0,1], referring
either to a probability (in cases like InheritanceLink, SimilarityLink, EquivalenceLink,
ImplicationLink, etc.) or a fuzzy value (as in MemberLink, EvaluationLink).
• Strong Self-Modification: This is generally used as synonymous with Self-Modification,
in a CogPrime context.
• Subsymbolic: Involving processing of data using elements that have no correspondence to
natural language terms, nor abstract concepts; and that are not naturally interpreted as
symbolically ”standing for” other things. Often used to refer to processes such as perception
processing or motor control, which are concerned with entities like pixels or commands like
”rotate servomotor 15 by 10 degrees theta and 55 degrees phi.” The distinction between
”symbolic” and ”subsymbolic” is conventional in the history of AI, but seems difficult to
formalize rigorously. Logic-based AI systems are typically considered ”symbolic”, yet
• Supercompilation: A technique for program optimization, which globally rewrites a program
into a usually very different looking program that does the same thing. A prototype
supercompiler was applied to Combo programs with successful results.
• Surface Realization: The process of taking a collection of Atoms and transforming them
into a series of words in a (usually natural) language. A stage in the overall process of
language generation.
• Symbol Grounding: The mapping of a symbolic term into perceptual or motoric entities
that help define the meaning of the symbolic term. For instance, the concept ”Cat” may be
342 A Glossary
grounded by images of cats, experiences of interactions with cats, imaginations of being a
cat, etc.
• Symbolic: Pertaining to the formation or manipulation of symbols, i.e. mental entities that
are explicitly constructed to represent other entities. Often contrasted with subsymbolic.
• Syntax-Semantics Correlation: In the context of MOSES and program learning more
broadly, this refers to the property via which distance in syntactic space (distance between
the syntactic structure of programs, e.g. if they’re represented as program trees) and semantic
space (distance between the behaviors of programs, e.g. if they’re represented as
sets of input/output pairs) are reasonably well correlated. This can often happen among
sets of programs that are not too widely dispersed in program space. The Reduct library
is used to place Combo programs in Elegant Normal Form, which increases the level of
syntax-semantics corellation between them. The programs in a single MOSES deme are
often closely enough clustered together that they have reasonably high syntax-semantics
correlation.
• System Activity Table: An OpenCog component that records information regarding
what a system did in the past.
• Temporal Inference: Reasoning that heavily involves Atoms representing temporal information,
e.g. information about the duration of events, or their temporal relationship
(before, after, during, beginning, ending). As implemented in CogPrime, makes use of an
uncertain version of Allen Interval Algebra.
• Truth Value: A package of information associated with an Atom, indicating its degree
of truth. SimpleTruthValue and IndefiniteTruthValue are two common, particular kinds.
Multiple truth values associated with the same Atom from different perspectives may be
grouped into CompositeTruthValue objects.
• Universal Intelligence: A technical term introduced by Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter,
describing (roughly speaking) the average capability of a system to carry out computable
goals in computable environments, where goal/environment pairs are weighted via the length
of the shortest program for computing them.
• Urge: In OpenPsi, an Urge develops when a Demand deviates from its target range.
• Very Long Term Importance (VLTI): A bit associated with Atoms, which determines
whether, when an Atom is forgotten (removed from RAM), it is saved to disk (frozen) or
simply deleted.
• Virtual AGI Preschool: A virtual world intended for AGI teaching/training/learning,
bearing broad resemblance to the preschool environments used for young humans.
• Virtual Embodiment: Using an AGI to control an agent living in a virtual world or game
world, typically (but not necessarily) a 3D world with broad similarity to the everyday
human world.
• Webmind AI Engine: A predecessor to the Novamente Cognition Engine and OpenCog,
developed 1997-2001 – with many similar concepts (and also some different ones) but quite
different algorithms and software architecture
