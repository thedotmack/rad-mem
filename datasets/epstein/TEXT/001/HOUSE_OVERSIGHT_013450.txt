Winner Woody Allen may have missed Hollywood’s
biggest lovefest, but intrepid über movie publicist
Peggy Siegal was there for
every single party and every single
step of the red carpet way. This
year, her exclusive Oscar diary
chronicles close encounters with
Michelle Williams, Meryl Streep,
Harvey Weinstein, Nancy Reagan,
Elizabeth Olsen, George Clooney
and his French doppelganger
Jean Dujardin and, of course, Uggie.

N
avigating our presidential
campaign was a piece of cake
compared to understanding the
nuances of the 2011 Oscar race for the
most revered artistic honor in the world.
This is how nine films fell into the big
picture.
Three premiered in Cannes mid-May,
a distant nine months ago, creating an
Oscar campaign as long as any human
pregnancy. At the Palais, the first inkling
of Oscar buzz was born as the reclusive
Woody Allen premiered Midnight in
Paris. PBS later aired a documentary of
Woody discussing his forty-four films
showing the astonishing depth of his
talent that made you want to immediately
hand him the Oscar for Best Picture.
Academy rules and Woody forbade
marketing this gem.
Woody is not a member of the
Academy becase he doesn’t feel that films
should be in competition. He told me, “A
statue does not change your life. You still
get a cold. You can’t get a date. You still
have everyday things to worry about.”
The Academy learned to love him from
a distance and gave him Best Original
Screenplay as a consolation.
Terrence Malick’s long-awaited,
esoteric The Tree of Life was unveiled at
Cannes and won the coveted Palme D’Or,
positioning it for a nomination.
The Artist, created by the French, shot
in Hollywood and about Hollywood was
the festival surprise. This charming and
oddly original black-and-white silent
entry was introduced by the ringmaster
himself, Harvey Weinstein. No one
could pronounce or spell director Michel
Hazanavicius’s name. Jean Dujardin
could not speak a word of English and
neither could his 10-year-old co-star, the
Jack Russell Uggie who had been rescued
from the pound after two adopters found
him too wild. Tragically Uggie developed
an undisclosed neurological disorder
during production, forcing him to retire
at the height of his popularity.
No slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in
Cannes. Any future film could easily win.
DreamWorks’ The Help premiered
in LA in August and distributor Disney
began propelling the politically correct and
socially significant film to box office heaven
of $200 million. Viola Davis and Octavia
Spencer were forecast to win Oscars.
In September, the Toronto and New
York Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight
presented Alexander Payne’s Hawaiian
family saga, The Descendants, which broke
out of the pack with whispers of winning.
Beloved George Clooney, playing a
father for the first time was hailed as a
shoo-in for best actor. Directing Ides of
March added momentum.
Also at New York’s festival Marty
Scorsese and Paramount sneaked an
unfinished cut of Hugo in Alice Tully
Hall, built for concerts but converted into
a 3-D theater. Marty was christened the
visionary genius of an innovative, costly
3-D masterpiece.
Director Bennett Miller’s highly
anticipated Moneyball for Sony hit a
grand slam at its west coast premiere in
58 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012
Oakland putting the film, its heart throb star
Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and seasoned writers
Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin in play.
Spielberg’s epic War Horse for DreamWorks
came thundering down the pike with a huge
premiere back at Alice Tully Hall, with
posters of Lincoln Center’s Tony winning
theatrical version and their indelible puppets
in the background. Steven paid homage to
legends John Ford and David Lean and the
country fell in love with a horse named Joey
and his 14 stand-ins.
Studios worked their stars to the bone.
Ironically, Harvey Weinstein’s independent
French talent who lived in Paris were not
as available as their competitors, therefore
Uggie became a superstar igniting a pet war.
Christopher Plummer, who had Best
Supporting Actor in the bag promoted his
Jack Russell, Cosmo. Diminutive Scorsese
was seen on TV on a small couch with his
large Doberman, Blackie, drooling on his
suit. Spielberg never got a chance to trot
out his lead horse Joey, previously seen in
Seabiscuit because his ravishing reddish coat
was now darkened for another role.
By December, as film critics bestowed
their own awards upon many films, Stephen
Daldry struggled to finish Extremely Loud
and Incredibly Close with a new score. There
was buzz Daldry could be editing the winner.
Producer Scott Rudin juggled his astounding
three films in one year from Daldry, Miller
and David Fincher directing Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo.
Daldry has received three consecutive
directing nominations. In January, for
his fourth film, he received a Best Picture
nomination, for a boy’s emotional journey
dealing with 9/11, and the nine films were
officially off and running. Forty-five film and
media groups handed out awards leading up
to Oscar night.

My airplane seatmate to LAX was
Sony Classics Michael Barker. The night
before Woody Allen had shown Michael
To Rome With Love, his new film
shot in Rome and rumored to be his
best. When Woody won the Oscar
Sunday night, for a record breaking
23rd overall nomination, he had just
finished pasta at Sette Mezzo on
Lexington Avenue with art dealer
Lorinda Ash and Soon-Yi. He went
home and watched the N.B.A. All-Star
game. Soon-Yi watched the awards
show on a TiVo delay in another room.
Brad Pitt and
Angelina Jolie
David and
Victoria
Beckham
Jane Fonda and Richard Perry
By the time Woody won, he had fallen
asleep and Soon-Yi didn’t want to wake him.
The next morning he went to the breakfast
table alone and read in The New York Times
that he had won. He had to think it was a
good omen and he would not catch a cold
that day.
Before Michael and I flattened our
recliner chairs for the big sleep, I told him
I felt confident his Iranian film A Separation
would win Best Foreign Film. He told me The
Artist would take Best Picture and Director.
Actor was a tight race between Brad Pitt,
Jean Dujardin, the “Clooney of France”
and the real George Clooney. George was
essentially running against a version of
himself, which only slightly amused him.
The biggest dilemma was Viola vs. Meryl.
Michael picked Meryl as New Yorkers did.

Johansson
Salma Hayek
Billy Crystal
Meryl’s publicist
Leslee Dart
whispered to me.
“She is dressed like
an Oscar. What do
we do if she loses?”

The Help had taken on a life of its own lead
by vivacious Viola in LA. The Iron Lady, a
much criticized film, showcased Meryl’s
tour-de-force performance. Few knew at
the last minute, on President’s weekend,
Harvey’s shout out, “She hasn’t won in 29
years!” resonated.
An androgynous driver named Monica
greeted me at the airport in a black
tuxedo that would make Albert Nobbs
weep for joy, prompting me to devilishly
think of her as “Nobbs” all weekend.
She barely recognized me sporting a new
Sally Hershberger hairdo, “the yenta with
the dragon tattoo.”
Checking into the Beverly Hills Hotel I
bumped into Best Actress nominee, Golden
Globe and Spirit Award winner Michelle
Williams with her daughter Matilda Ledger
headed to the swimming pool. Innocently
standing there with no makeup she was
remarkably the antithesis of Marilyn
Monroe. I told her she so deserved the
Oscar for her mesmerizing transformation
which did not cheer her up knowing the
gold was going to Viola or Meryl.
This year there seemed to be more parties
than ever. Vanity Fair publisher Edward
Menicheschi staged a staggering six
nights of “CAMPAIGN HOLLYWOOD.”
Ermenegildo Zenga and Colin and
Livia Firth hosted an intimate dinner at
the Chateau Marmont to benefit Oxfam
America, Colin’s pet charity. Editor
Graydon Carter and Edward greeted
Cameron Diaz, Kristin Davis, Gary and
Alexandra Oldman and Mia Wasikowska.
In addition, Livia spoke about her ‘Green
Carpet Challenge’ which uses eco-friendly
fabrics for “wear it once” gowns at awards
shows. Get it? Go green on red.
Thursday, February 23
Thursday night boasted 15 events
causing party panic. Here is a brief
rundown of seven.
At The Hollywood Reporter’s Nominee
Night, editor Janice Min and publisher
Lynne Segall greeted the power brokers.
With ballots in, competing studios
cordially mingled in the Mayor’s
backyard. Owen Wilson slipped in the
back door and hung with Michael Sheen
and producer Letty Aronson. Producers
Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall
chatted with DreamWorks’ partner Stacey
Snyder, producer Graham King and Emily
Mortimer. Fox’s Tom Rothman and Jim
Gianopulos compared notes with Focus’
James Shamus. Young directors Drake
Doremus (Like Crazy), Sean Durkin (Martha
Marcy May Marlene) and Oscar nominee
and Spirit Award winner J.C. Chandor
(Margin Call) drank at the bar. Breakout
directors Nick Jarecki (Arbitrage), Zal
Batmanglij (Sound of My Voice and
The East) and Jay Duplass (Jeff Who
Lives at Home) dreamed about their
future nominations. Aaron Sorkin,
Piers Morgan and Lawrence O’Donnell
handicapped Romney vs. Obama as
Brooklyn Decker sashayed by.
Urs Fisher’s exhibition Beds & Problem
Paintings featured two bed sculptures at
Larry Gagosian’s Gallery followed by his
private dinner at Mr. Chow’s. Art lovers Vera
Wang, Russell Simmons, Steve Martin, Jean
Pigozzi and John Waters attended.
The US-Ireland Alliance honored
nominees Hugo screenwriter John Logan,
Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy and
Michelle Williams at Bad Robot. Logan also
wrote Rango, Coriolanus, 007’s Skyfall and
Jersey Boys for the big screen.

Woody is not a member of the
Academy because he doesn’t feel
that films should be in competition.
He told me, “A statue does not change
your life. You still get a cold. You can’t
get a date. You still have everyday
things to worry about.”
Alfre Woodard hosted a down and
dirty girls night out in a rented house
above Sunset for Viola Davis and Octavia
Spencer.
Universal honcho Ron Meyer hosted a
civilized private buffet at his Malibu home
for Graydon Carter with Tom Cruise,
Leonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand,
Tom Hanks and Michael Douglas.
Stunning socialite Betsey Bloomingdale
gave a seated dinner at her Holmby Hills
home for best friends Nancy Reagan,
Wendy Stark, Bob Colacello, Joan
Collins and fashion icon Lynn Wyatt.
Tobias Meyer, auctioneer for Sotheby’s
and art dealer Mark Fletcher hosted
an open house at their Mulholland
Drive home for American avant-garde
photographer Terry Richardson. This is
the only pre-Oscar party where a guest
dropped his pants and mooned the red
carpet and Terry signed a fans breast.
Art collectors Bill and Maria Bell, Todd
Eberle, rock singer Jack Donahue and
Francesco Clemente schmoozed.
Friday, February 24
At the BHH I ran into David Heyman,
English producer of the Harry Potter
franchise who was honored at the
Publicists Awards lunch at The Beverly
Hilton. “Motion Picture Showman of the
Year” was the consolation prize for being
snubbed by the Academy for visualizing
a publishing miracle for children around
the world.
“Nobbs” whisked me off to the
British Film Reception hosted by
Jeremy Hunt, UK Secretary of State for
Culture and Olympics and the British
Consul-General Dame Barbara Hay,
in her Hancock Park residence. Upon
introduction, I blurted out that my friend
Lord Astor was interested in having
L.A. people get to know his son-in-law,
Prime Minister David Cameron. As an
appointed diplomat she was horrified by
my indiscretion and turned to greet the
next American idiot. I was just making
conversation.
Daldry told Sony’s Sir Howard
Stringer and astute film CEO Michael
Lynton, Kenneth Branagh, Janet McTeer
and Gary Oldman that he, as executive
producer of the Olympics, was headed
back to London to oversee special events,
including the opening ceremony, directed
by Danny Boyle. Victoria Beckham

made a dramatic, sullen, last-minute
appearance looking perfectly skinny in a
dress from her eponymous collection.
At the Women in Film cocktail party
at Cecconi’s, Gwyneth Paltrow, Shailene
Woodley, Selena Gomez and Vanessa
Hudgens networked with Jessica, Octavia
and Viola now of social stamina fame.
Blythe Danner kissed me at the door
as a military-type looked on. I kept saying
to him, “Where have we met?” Nowhere.
He was astronaut Mark E. Kelly who
came with Blythe and is married to
former congresswoman Gabrielle
Giffords, Paltrow’s second cousin. Only
I could mistake an astronaut for a movie
marketing guy.
Vanity Fair fêted Scorsese and The
Film Foundation, which has saved 555
films in 22 years. Cocktails were at the
restored Bel-Air Hotel. Honorary Jewess
Lorraine Bracco ran past me yelling
that she was late for Ronald Perelman’s
Shabbat dinner. Three, three-time Oscar
winners: composer Howard Shore,
costume designer Sandy Powell and editor
Thelma Schoonmaker were honored.
Sir Ben Kingsley, Danny Huston, Patty
Clarkson, Irwin Winkler and Giorgio
Armani’s niece Roberta Armani with
Wanda McDaniels debated best
director: Marty or Michel?
“Nobbs” delivered me to WME’s
Party at kahuna Ari Emanuel’s
Brentwood estate, where NFL
quarterback and new client
Tim Tebow was the toast of
the party, especially to Taylor
Swift who made $35.7 million
this year. Michael Douglas
gave me a kiss… doesn’t
get any better. Longtime
lovebirds Robert Pattinson
and Kristen Stewart made
a rare appearance, glued
to each other’s hips.
They mingled with costar
Taylor Lautner,
Miley Cyrus, and her
Hunger Games beau Liam
Zoe
Saldana
Hemsworth. Meanwhile
Charlize Theron, Jack
Black, Rooney Mara, Ben
Stiller, Barry Sonnenfeld
and Larry David talked
business with moguls Les
Moonves and Viacom’s
Philippe Dauman.
Next was UTA Chairman
Felicity Jones
Brooklyn
Decker
Jim Berkus’ soiree that police almost
shut down because the DJ got carried
away impressing Harrison Ford,
Channing Tatum, Jerry Bruckheimer,
Tom Freston, Disney’s Rich Ross,
SNL’s Lorne Michaels and Oscar show
producer Brian Grazer.
Sunset Tower Hotel owner Jeff Klein
and producer John Goldwyn hosted a
secret dinner for Anna and Graydon
Carter at their Hollywood Hills home
with Tom Ford, Mitch Glazer, Fran
Lebowitz, Vito Schnabel, Denise Hale,
Lisa and Eric Eisner and VF’s Punch
Hutton, who is Tim Hutton’s sister.
Last stop was CAA Byran Lourd’s
“Friday Night Party”. “Nobbs”
was instructed to drop me off at a
neighborhood school where a luxury van
transported guests to the stone and glass
Bel-Air estate situated on a narrow street.
I knew that guests Colin Firth, Penelope
Cruz, Sofia Vergara, Salma Hayek,
Sandra Bullock, and Glee’s Matthew
Morrison did not arrive by bus. Once
inside the playing field leveled out and
pound for pound there was more famous
flesh per square inch than the Oscars
Miley Cyrus
themselves.
I huddled with Meryl on the couch and
we talked about her race. She thought
Viola. I thought Meryl. She didn’t know
about Harvey’s last-minute “29 year”
shout out.
I hugged Bette Midler and flirted
with Jim Sturgess and Bennett Miller.
Universal’s Donna Langley, who is
overseeing Tom Hooper’s production
Les Miserables, mentioned Hugh
Jackman’s impeccable manners should
insure best behavior from Russell Crowe.
I introduced HBO’s Game Change
director Jay Roach, who is an authority
on Hitler, to George Clooney who is
writing a thriller about the Nazis stealing
art. Clooney whispered, “The Frenchman
is winning.”
I thanked Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane
and Richard Lovett, got on the bus and
prayed that I get invited back.
Saturday, February 25
I dragged my tired ass to the Academy,
as foreign film aficionado Mark Johnson
was conducting a symposium on the
nominated films, which included Sony
APRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 63
Colin Firth and Livia Giuggiolo
Natalie
Portman
Classic’s Footnote from Israel and A
Separation from Iran. From the other
side of the world both governments
monitored their directors as the Sony
boys kept the peace.
Michael and Tom Bernard invited me
to the Independent Spirit Awards at the
Santa Monica Pier. Michael hosted his
Take Shelter nominees Jessica Chastain,
Michael Shannon and director J e ff
Nichols. Tom held court at the next
table with the entire Iranian cast of A
Separation, which won. Tom almost had
a heart attack when I threw my arms
around Iranian director Asghar Farhadi,
which in Iran is unacceptable behavior,
especially by a Jewish American Princess.
Tom wished I had gone to the crowded
champagne brunch in honor of Prince
Albert and Princess Charlene at the Bel-
Air Hotel where Montblanc launched
Grace Kelly watches. Simultaneously,
TV producer Gary Pudney hosted
another secretive, lunch which Albert
and Charlene actually attended with
Graydon Carter, Carolina Herrera,
Wallace Annenberg, Bobby Shriver,
Bobby Marx, Kathy and Ricky Hilton
and Lynn Wyatt. Wolfgang Puck
joined them for dessert.
“The French,” as the The
Artist gang was nicknamed, had
won six Césars, France’s version
of the Oscars, in Paris the night
before. They flew all night and
Harvey’s chauffeur arranged a
police escort from LAX just in
time for them to win four Spirit
Awards, cementing the Oscar
win.
Back at the BHH, Spielberg
was the first to arrive at the
tenth annual “Night Before”
fundraiser in support of the
Motion Picture and Television
Fund. Jeffrey Katzenberg had
already secured $200 of a $350
million fundraising goal that
included money from him,
Tom Cruise, Steve Bing,
Casey Wasserman, Clooney
and Spielberg. Every nominee
showed up.
Chanel and Charles Finch
cooked up their chic soiree at
Madeo, where a mariachi band
enthusiastically announced
everyone’s arrival. Bedecked
exclusively in Chanel were Diane
Kruger, Elizabeth Olsen, Rose Byrne,
Ginnifer Goodwin and Rachel Bilson.
Also air kissing were Rachel Zoe,
Rosanna Arquette, Alice Evans and
Ioan Gruffudd, Zachary Quinto, Julia
Ormond and Dustin Hoffman.
My Week With Marilyn’s English
director Simon Curtis insisted we join
Kenneth Branagh at The Weinstein
Olivia Wilde
Company’s bash at the Soho House in
time to hear Tony Bennett sing “Autumn
Leaves” to Harvey’s surprised 86-yearold
mother Miriam, Madonna and
Meryl. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo,
Michel Hazanavicius and producer
Thomas Langmann staggered around
completely jet lagged, too tired to speak
English. Uggie on the other hand was
the absolute star of the evening as his
trainer placed him in everyone’s arms
for photos. W.E’s Andrea Riseborough
and Abbie Cornish sat next to baseball
cap-clad Leonardo DiCaprio as his ex,
Bar Refaeli, kept her distance across
the room. Zoe Saldana walked in
holding hands with Bradley Cooper.
Scarlett Johansson introduced me to
her boyfriend Nate Naylor. Katy Perry,
Felicity Jones and Malin Akerman
circled a refreshed Gerard Butler. The
two daughters of New York slain hero cop
Peter Figoski, Corrine, 14 and Caroline,
16 who had also been Harvey’s guests at
the Super Bowl stood in the middle of
this circus and just fainted.
Sunday, February 26
I met interior designer Nicky Haslam
in the Polo Lounge and found Nancy
Reagan brunching with Bob Colacello
and Carolina Herrera. Nancy knows me
as “The DVD Lady”. I promised to send
her The Iron Lady. I didn’t have the heart
to tell her that her late husband, who was
Margaret Thatcher’s best friend, was
barely mentioned in the film.
In a Marchesa gown, Dennis Basso
fur and Iradj Moini necklace, I collected
Simon Curtis and headed to the
Hollywood & Highland Center. Simon,
who has never been to the Oscars before,
miraculously scored a front row seat
between Michelle Williams and Clooney.
We pulled up to screams of hysteria at the
mother of all red carpets.
Meryl’s publicist Leslee Dart
whispered to me. “She is dressed like
an Oscar. What do we do if she loses?”
Sacha Baron Cohen hilariously guilted
the Academy into letting him wear his
costume from The Dictator and, after
soiling Ryan Seacrest, he went directly
to dinner at Vanity Fair. Gwyneth
Paltrow won the style award in Tom
Ford’s white column and Angelina Jolie
so successfully invented a new one legged
pose in a thigh high slit gown on the red
carpet she repeated it for 39.3 million

I introduced HBO’s Game Change director
Jay Roach, who is an authority on Hitler, to
George Clooney who is writing a thriller
about the Nazis stealing art. Clooney
whispered, “The Frenchman is winning.”
people onstage.
Tickets were so tight that I gave my plus
one to Penelope Ann Miller because she
promoted The Artist every day for four
months. Seated next to us were co-stars
James Cromwell and Missi Pyle.
Billy Crystal made us laugh, Cirque de
Soleil made us gasp and most of the wins
were expected.
Colin Firth crowned Meryl her third
win on a record 17 nominations and
Harvey beamed.
The Academy was so confident The
Artist would win, they invited Uggie,
who waited in the wings and ran out as
Tom Cruise announced the film.
Once the show was off the air, I followed
my seatmates to the stage loaded with
their programs, wraps and handbags and
led the French to the press rooms.
The Governor’s Ball was the next
stop where the winners got their Oscars
engraved. Everyone paid respects to
the Academy’s Tom Sherak and Dawn
Hudson. Stars headed to the Sunset Tower
to Graydon’s glittering Vanity Fair Oscar
bash and their militarized security with
micro chipped cards. If your name was
not on the list and you were carrying an
Oscar, you could walk in. Billy and Janice
Crystal were mobbed with well wishers.
Elton John made $5 million dollars at his
20th AmFar event which also auctioned
off two tickets to Vanity Fair’s party for
$230,000.Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes
were thrilled to talk to George Lucas.
Gwyneth snuggled with Coldplay’s Chris
Martin and Jennifer Lopez brought boy
toy Casper Smart. Every major actor
previously mentioned is standing in the
room. Spotted in a sea of celebrity were
Tina Fey, Glenn Close, Olivia Wilde
and Jason Sudeikis, Terry George, Jane
Fonda, Demian Bichir, Claire Danes,
Meryl’s daughters Mamie Gummer with
husband Ben Walker, Grace Gummer,
Salma Hayek, Brit Marling, Natalie
Portman, Sofia Coppola, Peter Brant,
Stephanie Seymour, Ryan Kavanaugh,
Ingrid Sischy, Sandy Brant and Wendi
Murdoch with Bingbing Li.
George Clooney threw his own
exclusive after party at Craig’s in West
Hollywood for close friends Bryan
Lourd, Grant Heslov, Stan Rosenfield,
Brad and Angelina, Emily Blunt and
John Krasinski, Cindy Crawford,
Jimmy Kimmel, Ryan Seacrest and best
adapted screenplay winner Alexander
Payne.
George and Brad cancelled each
other out with two great performances.
Clooney immediately returned to his best
role as humanitarian, flew to the Sudan,
met with Obama and was dramatically
arrested at a protest.
“The French” threw a wild
celebration at the Chateau
Marmont, poured champagne
down their throats and threw
each other in the pool at 3:00
a.m. Nobody spoke English.
By 4:00 a.m. Harvey
rounded up his artists for a
live broadcast on The Today
Show from The Four Seasons
lobby. In disheveled black tie,
five Oscar winners, all total
unknowns a year ago, made Oscar
history with the first silent film to
win since 1927.
It wasn’t God, but 5,800
Academy voters who said they
won. This had to be the most
exciting night of their lives. The
glory and memories live forever.
The next day they went back
to reality . As Woody says, “A
statue does not really change
your life. You still get a cold.”
Uggie was invited
to the White House
correspondent’s dinner as
a guest of the Washington
Times in April. He hopes to
meet President Obama. ✦
