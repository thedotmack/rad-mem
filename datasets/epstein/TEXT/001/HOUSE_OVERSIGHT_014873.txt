Short interest ratio: catalyst for recovery
Over the past six months Hess has been one of the most volatile stocks in the sector, facing
headwinds from a significant increase in short interest that has exaggerated volatility. From
discussions with investors, the arguments against Hess seem to begin and end with a
combination of declining production and an expanding balance sheet – all part of the
deliberate portfolio choices that favored completing major projects at the expense of short
cycle production. We expect this to end in 2Q17 with a rebound in oil and gas production
starting in 2H17 and critically, an inflection in free cash flow that we expect will return Hess
to free cash flow with the flexibility to re-up investment in the Bakken. We thus would view
Hess as a dangerous ‘short’ for investors seeking to hedge other portfolio risks.
Inflection point on multiple levels right around the corner
We believe Hess’ investment case is approaching an inflection point on multiple levels.
We expect oil and gas production to trough in 2Q17, with a rebound of 60,000 boepd or
22%, by 4Q17 marking the single biggest sequential change in production of any
company in the sector. This is likely to kickstart an extended period of growth in
2018/19 but with the contribution from Guyana driving a step change in Hess’ growth
trajectory through 2025. Near term, we think Hess is also poised for an inflection in free
cash flow that is reasonably $1bn annualized, with $700mm irrespective of oil prices.
Versus consensus operating cash flow of ~$1.9bn in 2017, this stands out as the biggest
swing in free cash of any company in the sector.
Adding Hess to US 1 ‘best ideas’ list
After a year of waiting, we believe the inflection point in Hess’ investment case is just around
the corner, with the broader sector pullback positioning the shares with amongst the highest
upside in the sector as implied by our price objectives. At current levels, Hess ‘discounts’ strip
oil prices. Under our base case, which assumes a rebound in oil prices towards $70 from 2020
fair value is reasonably ~$80 per share. If non-producing asset value from Guyana is included
we estimate this would be closer to $90. BofAML’s US1 list is a collection of the firm’s best
investment ideas managed with the goal of providing superior investment performance over
the long term. For Hess, we believe the combination of catalysts, short interest and absolute
value can drive a period of strong relative outperformance vs peers. For this reason, Hess
replaces DVN as the energy stock on BofAML’s US 1 list.

Oils
Company Description
Hess Corp (HES) is a mid-sized oil and gas
company with 1.0bn boe of proved reserves at the
end of 2015. E&P operations are focused in the US
onshore, deepwater GOM, North Sea, West Africa
oil, and Asian natural gas.
Investment Rationale
Our house view is that oil should rebound long
term to $75 WTI / $80 Brent. Investment case
anchored by exploration prospects led by Guyana.
Added to this, it has a strong balance sheet, low
risk production visibility in the Bakken and a stable
international base. As such, we view HES' valuation
as attractive and maintain our Buy rating.

Adding Hess to BofAML US1 list
Inflection point
Over the past six months Hess has proven to be one of the most volatile stocks in the
sector, facing extraordinary headwinds from a significant increase in short interest that
has exaggerated volatility of what is already one of the more highly levered oil stocks in
the sector. From discussions with investors, the arguments against Hess begin and end
with a combination of declining production and expanding balance sheet – all part of the
deliberate portfolio choices that favored completing major projects at the expense of
short cycle production.
This cycle ends in 2Q17 with an expected rebound in oil and gas production starting in
2H17 and critically, an inflection in free cash flow that by our estimates should return
Hess to free cash flow with the flexibility to re-up investment in the Bakken. We thus
view Hess as a dangerous short for investors seeking to hedge other portfolio positions.

In our view, any meaningful reduction in short interest could drive an outsize response
to the improving operating outlook that we expect to start in 2H17 and can be
summarized as follows:
• By our estimates, oil and gas production troughs in 2Q17 as Bakken production
stabilizes before recovering through year-end. With start-up of the first of two
major projects (NMB 1 ) and incremental production in the US GoM, we
anticipate growth in oil and gas production of ~60,000boepd or 22% between
2Q17 & 4Q17.
• Planned increase in Bakken rig count points to an exit rate of ~105–110
kboepd up from 90-95 kboepd in 1Q17 for an intra-year growth rate of ~16%
underpinned by a step up to 6 rigs from 2 at the start of the year. We expect
Bakken growth to continue in 2018 and 2019 at ~16% yoy with upside from
larger completions.
Management guidance suggests exit rate production in 2017 of ~335,000 boepd; startup
of the second of Hess’ major projects (Stampede) adds 15,000 boepd from 1H18
(est); along with a resumption of growth by resurgent operator Aker BP at Valhall (Hess
64%) we expect top line growth of 15% in 2018 with a FY contribution and continued
Bakken ramp contributing to ~10% growth in 2019 including first oil from Guyana.

In other words, 2Q17 marks the low point in oil and gas production, with
momentum accelerating in 2H17 to kick start a multi-year period of growth.

Critically, Hess has multiple levers to pull that reverse production declines as cash
becomes available from completion of NMB and Stampede.
Planned spending to complete NMB and Stampede is ~$700mm in 2017; with
completion we expect this to drop closer to $200mm in 2018 so that before any
contribution from operating cash flow from these projects we expect Hess ‘apples to
apples’ capex to move lower in 2018 driving an inflection in free cash flow.

Our assumptions include a likely project sanction of the first phase ‘early production
system’ at the Liza discovery in 2Q17. However, based on discovered oil to date that we
believe now easily exceeds 2bn barrels, we believe Hess is on the cusp of a multi-year
period of growth that is material for a company of its size. Critically, we believe most
commentators have not yet included the cash flow contribution from Guyana in Hess’
estimates given visibility that barely looks past 2018. However, with first oil now likely
4 Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017
in 2H19, we view final investment decision (FID) – and an exploration program that
yields one well result every 6-8 weeks as a catalyst to rerate Hess over time.
Liza area moving towards 2bn boe
Operator Exxon recently confirmed the latest exploration test in Guyana 'Snoek' as the
latest discovery in the Liza development area, with ~82ft of net pay and in line with pre
drill expectations we are led to believe is in the 200-300mm boe range. Recall from our
discussions with management, Snoek was characterized as a smaller but distinct target,
updip of Liza, but lower risk.
The well was drilled in 26 days to a depth of ~17,000ft in 5,128ft of water 5 miles south
west of Liza #1, as shown in the graphic below; the Stena Carron drill ship has now
relocated to the next well test, the 'Liza #4' appraisal, where we anticipate results by
end April but with the possibility of a drill stem test in a success case that may push the
well result into mid-May.
Exhibit 5: Liza targeting
Exhibit 6: Exxon operated blocks in Guyana

Source: Exxonmobil
Critically, 'Snoek' reinforces management's prior characterization of the Stabroek block
as moving towards a 'DHI play' meaning the risk profile of incremental exploration
improves - a critical factor for the next well in queue, the Payara #2 appraisal that will
also target a deeper test (Pacuma) scaled with a pre drill target of ~1bn boe. The next
prospect, Liza lookalike named ‘Turbot will likely be spud around mid-year.
From our discussions with Hess and the operator we summarize our understanding as
follows:
• Operator XOM had previously framed the discovered potential in the Liza /
Payara at 1.5bn – 2.0bn boe, subject to completion of two planned additional
appraisal wells. Quoting EVP Mark Albers and CEO Darren Woods
‘The success at Payara combined with the additional oil pay discovered with Liza-3
brings the total discovered resource on the block to somewhere between 1.4 billion oil
equivalent barrels and 2 billion oil equivalent barrels.’
’ to clarify, what we have found – not potential upside, but what we have found is 1.4
billion to 2 billion BOE. The upside is multi-billion barrel unrisked potential’.
Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017 5
• Snoek and with Liza deep previously likely moves recoverable resource closer
to the upper end of this range 2bn boe before Liza #4 and Pacuma, providing
line of sight for at least a 4 FPSO development starting in 2019.
• After Liza 4, the Stena Carron drillship will move back to Payara to drill an
appraisal well which will also test a deeper prospect ‘Pacuma tail’. Where predrill
prospect size is scaled at about 1bn boe. The next prospect (Turbot) will
then be spud south east of Payara. Note is that if Payara 2 is successful, this
would likely add another ‘boat’ with capacity of 150,000 boepd.
The graphics below characterize Hess view of Payara and Snoek. We assume the 1bn
boe Pacuma prospect is the light green area below Payara.

Exhibit 8: Updated characterization suggests a similar footprint to Liza

Again quoting ExxonMobil management:
‘Just as we progressed rapidly at Liza, we'll move quickly to develop Payara if the
delineation well is successful.’
Recall that Hess management has suggested Payara will ‘definitely be commercial’.
However at this early stage we assume no value for Payara in our assessed value of
Hess’ not least as any attempt at precision is obviously premature. But with discussions
with management suggesting scenarios through appraisal where Payara is a lookalike to
Liza, we believe a ‘plus three year’ development scheme is a reasonable basis to frame
option value in a success case.
Under our $70 Brent base case, the theoretical NPV would be around $10/sh. This is on
top of the approximate $12-14/ share value we estimate is reasonable for Hess from
the existing Liza discovery. Note we continue to assume about 400,000 bpd gross
development scenario–reviewed again below to reflect the latest project proposal
submitted to the Guyana Government which now targets first production in 2H19.
Note we assume negligible value for natural gas revenue in this latest iteration, thus the
range of $12-$14 for Liza mentioned above and $22-$24 for Liza / Payara. The table
below assumes gas valued at $1 / mmcfe.

Note that at current strip oil prices of ~$55 Brent, this is closer to $14.4/sh of which
Payara is ~$6/sh or $2.0bn. On a ‘risked’ basis, we believe this is a reasonable
development scenario representative of any incremental discovery that resembles Liza
recalling that the partners have identified over 20 additional drilling prospects. On the
assumption of a ‘plus three year’ development scenario after Liza, the potential impact
on incremental production and cash flow is significant for Hess while the cumulative
impact also becomes significant for XOM.
The charts below show our latest assessment of how a compound timeline for a Liza /
Payara development could look, if Payara as a project does indeed prove to be a look
alike to Liza.

Exhibit 10: Hess net production profile (by phase)

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates
Critically, Guyana is now being described as a ‘DHI play’ meaning seismic and core have
been sufficiently calibrated as to provide direct hydrocarbon indicators and hence derisking
future exploration tests. This appears confirmed again by the latest ‘Snoek’
success.
XOM’s development plan calls for an FPSO (floating production and storage offloading
vessel) with production capacity of about 150,000 boepd for every 450mm barrels of
recoverable reserves, with plateau production extending up to 10 years. We suggest
management’s commentary supports gross production capacity from current discovered
resource of at least 600,000 boepd.
Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017 7
Impact on cash flow
While the impact on production is significant, we suggest the impact on cash flow is
transformational for Hess. Referencing the charts below:
• Under our base case that assumes $70 oil from 2020, we estimate operating
cash flow net to Hess would reach over $2.5bn;
• Net free cash flow peaks at over $2bn with a net cash outflow at any point in
the development of ~$300mm.

While first oil in 2019 is only the early stage of development, it is enough in our view to
provide visibility on multiple compression perceived absent from Hess’ investment case
given its focus on short cycle development. However, after the low point in production
in 2Q17 we suggest Hess has both – short cycle, comprising not only the Bakken but tie
back opportunities across established infrastructure in Norway and the US GoM – and
long cycle in the shape of a transformational opportunity in Guyana, that becomes
tangible with a likely FID in 2Q17.
Impact on valuation
In our view, an imminent inflexion point in free cash flow comes with a step change in
value recognition for Hess. Momentum from a >20% jump in production in the six
months of the second half of 2017 carries growth through 2018, with Guyana
accelerating for a decade from 2019. At our base case we suggest this leaves Hess
‘discounting’ current strip oil prices at current levels of ~$50 / share.
The table below sets our PO at our target mid cycle multiple of 5.5x EV/DACF; note this
does not include any value for non-producing Guyana resource value that we estimate at
~$6/share.

Under our base case, which assumes a rebound in oil prices towards $70 from 2020, we
see fair value as reasonably around $80 per share. If non-producing asset value is

BofAML US 1 list
The BofAML US1 list is a collection of the firm’s best investment ideas managed with
the goal of providing superior investment performance over the long term. Since the
presidential election, the ’trump tax rally’ that has arguably lifted the broader S&P500
on the expectation of lower corporate taxes has left most US oils lagging given the
absence of any benefit from lower taxes. For Hess, we believe the catalysts are still
ahead while the relative performance hurdle associated with the election has passed.
For this reason, Hess replaces DVN as our energy stock on the BofAML US1 list.

Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017 9
Price objective basis & risk
Hess Corp. (HES)
Our price objective of $80 / share is based on a 5-year outlook which assumes a 5.5x
DACF multiple and a commodity deck of $67.50 WTI and $70 Brent to which we add
$10 / sh for Liza in offshore Guyana. The multiple is based on a finite timeline to
delivery which is supported by core NAV.
The risks to our price objective are: 1) the oil and gas price environment, (2) slowdowns
in development drilling that leave production below expectations, and (3) news flow
around HES' exploratory and appraisal drilling activities that could impact the stock.

stock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.
