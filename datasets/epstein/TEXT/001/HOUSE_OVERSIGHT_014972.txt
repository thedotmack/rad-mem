Extract alpha from summer SPX range as policy and positioning “collar” equities
With the Federal Reserve last week appearing more emboldened to normalize monetary
policy, risk asset bears have come out in force. While we agree that a changing Fed
reaction function is likely not supportive of substantial equity upside, we think the
“Yellen put” still exists, albeit with a lower strike. Hence, we see monetary policy as
providing a near-term “collar” (long put/short call) on a US equity market already prone
to getting trapped in record-tight trading ranges. Further impetus for a summer rangetrade
should come from (i) fiscal policy, as gridlock caps equity upside but policy hope
floors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where the risk of continued “fragility events”
(potentially exacerbated by stretched quant fund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up
investors still accustomed to buying dips. As a risk-limited range trade, we like buying
in-the-money down and out puts on the S&P. For example, an SPX Sep 2475 put that
knocks out at 2300 (6% OTM) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451), a 60% discount
to the 2475 / 2300 put spread.

Long EU banks dispersion: Buy Dec17 call on a basket, sell worst-of call
We recommend positioning for greater dispersion in EU bank sector returns via buying a
Dec17 105% call on an equally-weighted basket of Santander, BNP, ING, Intesa and
Deutsche Bank, part-financed by selling a worst-of call on the same basket for 1.8%
(net) indic., as: 1) improving macro/earnings, sensitivity to rates and regulatory
headwinds are likely to lead to greater differentiation within banks, 2) the entry point is
attractive given historically low implied vol (13 th 8y+ percentile) and high implied
correlation (81% bid vs latest 6M realised correl of 66%), 3) historical risk-reward at
current pricing is attractive (avg. P&L of +8.4% when positive vs -1.8% when negative),
and 4) the trade can be considered as a cheap call on EU equities as it has a similar
payoff profile but with greater benefit relative to its cost.
Asia
Buy depressed China vs. US risks through corridor variance spreads
As global central banks have taken on more hawkish tones, the uncertainty surrounding
policy tightening will be more positive for EM volatility than for DM volatility.
Additionally, our strategists have a more bearish outlook for the Chinese banking sector
(which makes up a majority of the HSCEI index) amid rapidly rising leverage, complex
shadow banking, and excessive home price inflation. Since we believe the global
synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX volatility,
we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points, a 3 vol
point discount to a vanilla variance spread. The entry point is attractive as the HSCEI-
SPX 18-month variance swap spread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year
trading range, the trade has a positive carry, and it benefits during China risk-off events.

BofAML GFSI TM X-Asset Risk Landscape
Stress now below normal for all asset classes
The indicator was little changed last week, finishing at -0.23.
• Stress is now in benign territory across all five asset classes: Stress in
across all asset classes (except equity) declined last week. Notably, rates stress
turned negative (benign territory) and stresses across all five asset classes are
now negative.
• Stress in Equity skew rose as ESTX50 and (to a lesser extent) S&P500 skew
steepened; indeed the gain in ESTX50 skew was the greatest across GFSI subcomponents
(Chart 2) and also historically significant (Chart 5).
• Commodity-related stresses fell the most across asset classes (Chart 3), led
by declines in Crude and Gold vol (Chart 2), reversing some of the gains after
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rose in recent weeks.

Volatility in the US
Risk-limited alpha in a “collared” market: SPX ITM KO puts
US equities vulnerable…to a summer range-trade
The Federal Reserve last week appeared more emboldened to normalize monetary
policy, not only raising interest rates by 25bps but also reiterating its intention to hike
four more times by the end of 2018 and stating that it “expects to begin implementing
a balance sheet normalization program this year” - all despite recent softness in
inflation data. Breakeven rates of inflation narrowed following the Fed communications
due to tighter monetary conditions in the face of slowing US economic data, and risk
asset bears responded in force, suggesting that Janet Yellen had “broken up” with
investors and that it would be prudent to sell “before it’s too late”.
We agree that the changing reaction function of the Fed is likely not supportive of
further substantial US equity upside and may be viewed as the Fed now providing a
short call option on the S&P 500. However, in our view, it is premature to conclude
from last week’s developments that the “Yellen put” is dead. We see its strike as
declining but would not underestimate Yellen’s dovish inclinations in a shock or the
capacity for the Fed to still remain credibly on hold as long as the US economy is not
“running hot”.
In short, we see monetary policy as now providing a “collar” (long put / short call) on a
US equity market that has already shown a propensity over the past year for getting
trapped in record tight trading ranges. 1 Other factors may also conspire to create a
summer range-trade for US equities, namely (i) fiscal policy, where gridlock likely caps
equity upside but lingering policy hope floors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where
the risk of continued “fragility events” (potentially exacerbated by stretched quant
fund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying dips.
Tug of war between fragile market/stretched positioning and cashed-up dip-buyers
As we have noted recently, US equities have displayed a historically unusual tendency to
jump rapidly from calm to stress and back (“fragility”), with the recent Tech sell-off and
rebound the latest example. For example, in the past year, the S&P 500 has seen
5sigma declines (3 in total—Brexit, Sep-16, May-17) occur 20x more frequently than
over the prior 90 years or so. The increased frequency of these “fragility events” is in
part due to vol failing to remain high post a spike as equity market participants continue
to aggressively “buy the dip” and in the process reset vol lower.
Historically low vol alongside consistently upward trending equity markets and low cross
asset correlations could be creating stretched positioning across markets. For example,
upward trending equities on historically low vol may be pushing CTA equity positioning
to near record levels (Chart 7). Risk parity portfolios could be increasing their leverage
due to low vol as well as low cross asset correlation (Chart 8). And lastly, inverse VIX
ETPs have seen increased open interest as performance has swelled on the back of
continued declines in vol and attractive term structure risk premia (Chart 9).
Should vol spike again alongside a reversal in equity price momentum and a rise in cross
asset correlations, then unwinds from these strategies could exacerbate market fragility.
However, this must be weighed against an investor base that has plenty of cash on hand
(Chart 10) and their potentially fickle but still-intact tendency to view any equity market
dip as an alpha opportunity.
1
For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in its tightest trading range in over
110 years in Jan-17; this followed a record in the S&P 500 ending Sep-16 for the longest
stretch of trading within a range of 1.77% since 1928.
4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017
Chart 7: A combination of upward trending global equity markets and
very low volatility have conspired to push trend following (CTA) equity
positioning to near record levels. Consequently, the beta of CTA
strategies to global equities is also at extreme levels
Chart 8: Owing to low cross asset vol and strong diversification, the
volatility of risk-balanced multi-asset portfolios has fallen to historically
low levels. Consequently, leverage levels across multi-asset & other
portfolios that target fixed vol have likely hit their caps

Extract risk-limited alpha from SPX range via cheap in-the-money knockout puts
As a risk-limited range trade, we like owning down-and-out puts on SPX that are already
in-the-money. For example, the SPX Sep 2475 put with a 2300 knock-out (continuous
observation) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451) and offers a 60% discount to the
vanilla 2475/2300 put spread, which is itself historically cheap (Chart 12).
If SPX stays above the 2300 barrier at all points in time before expiry, the structure is
equivalent to a 2475 put option. If the barrier is instead breached, the maximum loss
will be equal to the (low) upfront premium. The 2300 barrier is about 6% out-of-themoney,
hence “allows” for the elusive 5% correction not seen since Brexit (on a closing
basis). However, investors can mitigate the risk of breaching the barrier by either
moving it farther down (e.g., a 2245 barrier would indicatively raise the cost from 0.7%
to 1%), or by only observing it on a close-to-close basis (in turn sacrificing part of the
discount).

The trade prices attractively today due to exceptionally steep SPX put skew, which is
near its highs established since 2004 (Chart 11). With steep SPX put skew, the market
is implicitly pricing in a high probability that the option will knock-out during its life, i.e.,
that relatively large drawdowns are more likely. As detailed above, however, we see
many reasons why the most likely near-term scenario for US equities is to remain
range-bound. The structure is short 11% delta at inception and has the same vega
sensitivity as the equivalent put spread (short 6bps).
Chart 11: SPX put skew is near the all-time highs reached since 2002.
Steep skew helps cheapen knockout puts as the market is implying a
relatively high probability of the barrier being breached

Notable trends and dislocations (US)
The Fed turns more hawkish, though vol remains subdued
Last week, unsurprisingly the Fed opted to hike benchmark rates another 25bps.
However, the market was more focused on the FOMC’s unexpectedly hawkish message,
which indicated that it is willing to normalize policy despite weaker-than-desired
inflation. Our economists now think the Fed will announce balance sheet normalization
in September and will hike rates again in December. A more hawkish Fed could result in
higher real rates and a stronger USD, which ultimately should benefit our Growth to
Value rotation trade of long XLF calls versus short QQQ calls (see Chart 15). The S&P
500 was more-or-less flat week-over-week as it gained only 6bps. The tech selloff
continued, however, and the Nasdaq-100 dropped 105bps. Similarly, the Russell 2000
also dropped 105bps. Despite concerns on the Fed, the VIX fell 0.32 vol points to 10.38,
and SPX 1m ATM implied vol declined 0.3 vol points to 7.6%.

On June 9, the Nasdaq dropped nearly 2% as investors unwound
crowded positions, resulting in a sudden selloff from a period of
relative calm. However, despite the volatility among tech names
during the first week of June, the Nasdaq (CCMP) has not seen a
5% drawdown from a prior peak (using closing data) in 150
days. This is the longest such streak in the Nasdaq’s history.
Prior to today, the longest periods of similar calm occurred
during July ’83 and July ’86, when the index did not record a 5%
drawdown from a peak in 136 and 135 days respectively.

move larger than 0.5% in either direction. As a result, 10d
realized vol stood at 3.31% as of 16-Jun.
This is already the fourth time this year that SPX has gone more
than 10 consecutive days without a move greater than +/- 0.5%.
This has historically happened only in ’64, ’65 and ’52. The
longest such stretch this year lasted 15 consecutive trading
sessions and ended on 16-May. For comparison, in ’64 SPX had
8 stretches without such a move with the longest stretch
spanning 43 days.

Last week, we highlighted that investors who want to rotate out
of Growth strategies into Value strategies should take
advantage of elevated tech vol by buying XLF 1m ATM calls
financed by selling QQQ 1m ATM calls. After last week’s FOMC
meeting, the case for such a trade grows even stronger as the
market thinks the Fed has become more hawkish, driving up
real rates and the USD. Amid this backdrop, one could see
outperformance of Value names over Growth names, which tend
to have higher amounts of offshore revenues that would come
under pressure by a stronger dollar.
Additionally, the trade remains attractive at current levels as
pricing has only been better 1% of the time in 5 years. Today,
1.03 XLF calls could be bought for each QQQ call sold, whereas
over the past 5 years, the average number of XLF calls that
could be purchased was only 0.80.

Volatility in Europe
Buy EU banks dispersion: (+) basket call, (-) worst-of calls
Trade: Long Dec17 105% call on an equally weighted basket of SAN, BNP, ING,
ISP & DBK*, short Dec17 ATM worst-of call on the same basket for 1.8% indic.
(correl bid: 81%).
* We pick the top 5 stocks with the largest market cap within the SX7E (EU banks sector
index) corresponding to 5 different countries
We have previously highlighted our preference for vol dispersion trades both in the US
and the EU – with the most recent recommendation being sector dispersion
opportunities within the EU. In a similar vein, we suggest positioning for greater
dispersion within EU banks via buying a call on a basket of Santander, BNP Paribas, ING,
Intesa and Deutsche Bank part-financed by selling a worst-of call on the same basket as:
• Improving macro/earnings, sensitivity to rates and regulatory headwinds likely
to lead to greater differentiation within banks: An improving macro backdrop in
Europe & ongoing improvement in EPS revisions (see Style Cycle) paint a bullish
picture for EU banks as they are seen as leveraged macro plays within the EU.
However, we believe there is a potential for greater differentiation within banks as
our bank analysts have argued before (here and here) that: (i) some banks stand to
benefit more than others based on their earnings power should the uptick in the
earnings cycle continue, (ii) banks’ gearing to interest rate cycles, and therefore
likely impact from a more hawkish ECB, varies between different banks and (iii)
French and Benelux banks are likely to be most impacted under potential Basel IV
regulations.
• Entry point is attractive given historically low implied vols: The structure
benefits from its long vol bias as average 6M implied vol on the basket of 5
European banks is historically low (13 th %-ile since Jan-08, Chart 16).
• High implied correlation beneficial for structure’s short correlation bias: Chart
17 shows the average pairwise 6M and 3M realised correlations between the 5 EU
banks, which are historically low. Despite this recent drop in realised correlations,
implied correlation is priced higher, thus providing an interesting entry point for the
(short-correlation) trade.

• Attractive risk-reward profile at current pricing: As highlighted in Exhibit 1,
historically the trade held to expiry, at current pricing, would have generated an
average P&L of 8.4% when positive and -1.8% when negative. The risk-reward
looks even more attractive in extreme market outcomes as the max P&L of the
trade which is greater than 75% compares to the max loss of only 5.7%. The trade
also provides an effective way to gain long exposure to EU equities with limited
risks, as evident from the call-like payoff in Exhibit 1 (vs the ESTX50). It is worth
noting that, by construction, the maximum loss of the trade is 6.8% with the most
likely loss limited to the upfront premium of 1.8%. We also note that the trade
payoff profile is superior to a SX5E Dec17 ATM call when sized such that: (i) the call
premium is the same as the upfront premium for the dispersion trade (=1.8%, blue
line), as well as (ii) when the call premium is the same as the theoretical maximum
loss for the trade (=6.8%, orange line).

10 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017
Notable trends and dislocations (Europe)
European equities ended the week lower mainly due to a tech-driven sell-off on 12-Jun
during which the SX8P (European tech sector) witnessed its largest 1-day decline since
the UK’s EU referendum. Nevertheless, implied vols across European indices remained
mostly unchanged near 2 year lows.
• European intra-sector correlation continues to decline while inter-sector
correl has hit a floor: The average EU intra-sector 3m correlation is near a 10-
year low currently. In contrast, the average 3m inter-sector correlation reached a
10-year low in Mar-17 driven by post US election reflation trades but is now
rising off its lows likely driven by an unwind of reflation trades.
• SX7E implied-realised correlation near 5-year highs: SX7E 6m implied
correlation fell since Mar-17 but the implied-realised correlation spread remains
in the 88 th 5-year percentile driven by even lower realised correlation.
• ESTX50 3M put skew is near 5 year highs, in stark contrast to SXEP
(European Oil & Gas equity) put skew which is close to 5 year lows.
• The overall seasonality in ESTX50 realised volatility since 1987 has been one of
relatively lower vol during the summer months vs. autumn. In particular, May
stands out as the lowest vol month across most 10 year horizons, and this
also appears to be the case so far this year.
EU Intra-sector correl continues to decline while inter-sector correl is supported
The average European intra-sector 3m correlation is near a 10-year low, partly driven by
divergence within the personal & household goods, utilities, real-estate, autos and
insurance sectors (Chart 18 and Table 3). Interestingly, the average 3m inter-sector
correlation reached a 10-year low on 14-Mar-17 (as the 8-Nov-16 US election led to the
outperformance of sectors sensitive to inflation) but inter-sector correlation now seems
supported likely driven by the unwind of reflation trades (Chart 18).

Volatility in Asia
Long HSCEI-SPX volatility spread via corridor variance
Global synchronized monetary tightening is positive for EM vol
Emerging markets have been the biggest beneficiaries of the central bank-fueled
abundance of liquidity. However, we think the tide may be turning as last week, the Fed,
ECB, and BOE all delivered policy announcements with hawkish tones. How far they
really go to tighten policy when economic data is weakening still remains unknown.
However, we think the uncertainty surrounding tightening will be more positive for EM
volatility than for DM volatility.
Chinese banks: Rapid increase in leverage is a big concern
The HSCEI currently has a 70% weight in the financial sector. Recently, BofAML analyst
Winnie Wu turned very bearish on the sector as (1) leverage has rapidly increased—debt
to GDP rose by 18% in 2016 and may go above 300% by 2019, (2) shadow banking has
become too big, too complicated, and too levered to easily regulate—even at the
highest quality bank, China Merchants, off-balance sheet wealth management products
(WMP) have grown to 40% the size of on-balance sheet assets from just 18% two years
ago, and (3) excessive home price inflation—low and middle-income households are late
to the party and a correction in prices could have a systemic effect as property assets
have been used as collateral in WMPs.
SPX: The Fed is now “collaring” the market
Since the global financial crisis the Fed has been well known for providing a put option
by its willingness to step in during periods of market stress. However, post the Fed
meeting last week, it appears the central bank has decided to cap its monetary support
as some FOMC members seem worried that financial conditions are too loose.
Effectively, the market is now “collared” (more so for the SPX compared to EM) as the
downside is protected by the Fed put (though with a lower strike price) while the upside
is capped by log-jammed fiscal policy and positioning, where the risk of quant funds
selling record equity positions meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buyingthe-dip.
The depressed implied China vs. US risks should reverse
With the steep drop in global risk premium, the HSCEI-SPX 18-month variance swap
spread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range. Since we believe the
global synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX
volatility, we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points,
a 3 vol point discount to vanilla variance spreads. Investors will be exposed to the
realized vol spread between HSCEI and SPX as long as HSCEI stays within 70-110% of
its initial level. Pricing of corridor variance is cheaper than vanilla variance as investors
can avoid paying for the rich HSCEI convexity below the 70% barrier. The trade has a
positive carry and benefits during China risk-off events.
Note that the potential HSCEI index enhancement will reduce the financial weightings in
HSCEI from 70% to 50% and lower realized volatility by 1.8 vol points. However, the
enhancement will be implemented in stages. It will probably start in Dec-17 at the
earliest and will not be fully implemented by the end of 2018, in our view.

Notable trends and dislocations (Asia)
Most regions in Asia reported modest declines last week, led by Hong Kong’s HSCEI,
which lost 2.0% week-over-week. Much of the decline came on Thursday following the
US Fed’s decision to hike rates 25bps. Also in China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)
injected 410bn yuan (about $60bn) into the financial system via reverse-repos, the
largest cash boost since January. The central bank said the funds are meant to ease
concern amid a seasonal funding squeeze. The biggest contributors to the index’s loss
were financials names, including China Life Insurance (2628 HK), which fell 5.7%, Ping
An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318 HK), which dropped 3.7%, Bank of China Ltd
(3988 HK), which declined 1.8%, and China Merchants Bank Co Ltd (3968 HK), which fell
5.7%. We saw a similar decline from Hong Kong’s HSI index, which lost 1.6% percent
last week.
After the HSCEI and HSI, last week’s biggest losers were Korea’s KOSPI and India’s
NIFTY, which each returned -0.8% week-over-week. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.3%. On
Friday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left its monetary policy unchanged—it will continue to
control the yield curve via its negative benchmark rate and its asset purchasing program.
The final region to report a loss last week was Taiwan’s TWSE, which lost 0.4%.
On the other hand, the only region to see a gain last week was Australia, which saw its
ASX 200 benchmark increase 1.7% week-over-week. The biggest contributors to the
gain were Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA AU), which gained 3.4%, Westpac
Banking Corp (WBC AU), which increased 1.9%, and CSL Ltd (CSL AU), which added
2.9%.
10 day realized vol picked up in Asia last week, up 2.0 vol points to 9.6%
• Asian 3m ATM volatility declined on average 0.1 vol point to 12.3% last week, while
10 day realized vol increased on average 2.0 vol points to 9.6%. Notably, the HSI's
realized vol increased 5.4 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the
other hand, the NKY was the only index to see a decline in 10 day realized vol—it
dropped 4.3 vol points week-over-week to 7.2%.
• On average, term structures among Asian indices steepened by 0.2 vol points to
4.2% last week. The TWSE 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing
1.0 vol point to 2.9%. On the other hand, Hong Kong’s HSI saw the only flattening
as its term structure flattened 0.1 vol point to 4.9%.
• Asian 3M 90-110% skews widened 0.5 vol points on average to 3.8%. Taiwan’s
TWSE widened the most, increasing 2.3 vol points to -0.2%.

Calendar puts are attractively priced given the steep term
structure
With the continuous low realized volatility environment, both
NKY and HSCEI 3-month minus 12-month term structures
steepened to -3.7 vol points, which are near multi-year lows.
As our strategists think the Fed now appears concerned about
surging asset prices, investors should consider downside
hedges. Calendar puts, i.e. buying short-dated ATM puts and
selling long-dated OTM puts, are attractively priced given the
steep term structure.
Currently, we still have an open trade on NKY calendar puts (buy
Jul-17 19,500 puts vs sell Dec-17 17,500 puts) to hedge
downside risks.

JGB 10-year yield (Inverted)
The BoJ’s ongoing yield curve control has capped the
Nikkei/Topix ratio and its volatility
Japanese government bond (JGB) yield has been on a downward
trend over the last few years and has negatively impacted bank
earnings. As the Topix has higher weightings in banks than the
Nikkei, the NKY/TPX ratio has been grinding higher.
However, the NKY/TPX ratio appears to have flattened out since
the BoJ’s commitment to maintain the 10-year JGB yield at
around 0% in September 2016. With global central banks
increasingly advocating tighter monetary policies, the market
may start to speculate BoJ’s exit strategy and this may reverse
NKY/TPX’s upward trend. With TPX vol trading below NKY vol,
buying TPX calls funded by NKY calls may perform well in such a
scenario.

Options Risk Statement
Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk
Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.
Investor suitability
The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks
involved with investing in listed options:
