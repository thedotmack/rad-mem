Anne,
I have approved SPR 14-2007 and 5-2008. The Larkin item is OK. The appeal by Brindell re 144 Wells
Road should not be on the agenda. The sod/seed item is an item that Tim Frank is working on but I don't
think it's an agenda item. We need to check with Peter on that one. The infrastructure of large homes is
not an agenda item. Neither is the Trump appeal for 515 North County Road.
Two things that will be added though are: EAR Amendments and Zoning Study Items.
