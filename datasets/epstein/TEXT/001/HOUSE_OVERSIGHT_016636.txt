DESALINATION PLANT OPTION
City Dedicates Seawater Plant for Town
� Town remains a customer of the City of West Palm
Beach
� Additional capital and operational costs to Town of
Palm Beach
� Desalination plant located on City property
secure
reliable
sustainable

WHY LOOK TO THE OCEAN?
� Sustainable drought-proof source of
water
� Concern for availability of fresh
surface water and groundwater
resources = regulatory pressure
� Decreasing costs due to technology
improvements
� Comparable costs to indirect potable
water reuse projects

TAMPA BAY DESALINATION FACILITY
� 25 mgd plant
� Co-located with
power plant
� 8.5-acres for WTP
� Provides 10% water
demand for region

PRE-TREATMENT IS KEY TO SUCCESS
� Protect the Membranes
� Screens remove shells,
creatures, wood and debris
greater than ¼ inch
� Heavier solids settled out via
flocculation and clarification
� Smaller solids filtered via
microfiltration membranes
� Ultraviolet light controls biological
activity and fouling
� Control scale formation by
adjusting pH and using
antiscalants
Fine screens
Clarification Basin
UV units

SPECIALIZED MEMBRANES FOR TREATMENT
� RO membranes allow water
particles (dissolved ions) to pass
through tiny screens, while
blocking salts
� Highly specialized technology
� Large amounts of power required
to “push” water through the
membranes via pressure
� Pre-treatment important to
protect costly membranes

SOLIDS HANDLING REQUIRED
Desalination produces “waste” streams that require
materials to be disposed via landfill.
� Debris removed by screens
(shells, wood, etc) must be
landfilled
� Clarification process &
microfiltration backwash solids
are thickened, dewatered, and
sent to the landfill for disposal
Transportation of solids increase facility operations cost
and result with a larger carbon footprint.

DESALINATION PLANT LAYOUT
DESALINATION PLANT ISSUES
� 25 mgd facility required to produce 10 mgd potable water.
� Approximately 10 acres required ed for infrastructure.
� Complex treatment processes.
� Brine by-product waste disposal via deep injection well
(ocean outfalls no longer permitted for WTPs).
� Dewatered sludge must be disposed at landfill.
� Highly energy intensive to operate.
� N t il t f d d t
� Not necessarily exempt from proposed year-round water
restrictions drafted by SFWMD

FLORIDAN AQUIFER WATER PLANT OPTION
City Dedicates Floridan Plant for Town of Palm Beach
� Town remains a customer of the City of West Palm
Beach
� Additional capital and operational costs to Town of
Palm Beach
� Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis plant located on City
property
secure
reliable
sustainable

WHY LOOK TO THE FLORIDAN AQUIFER?
� Reliable and drought-proof source
located approximately 1,200 feet
below ground surface
� Relatively stable water quality
seasonally, but geographically
variable
� Reduces demands on water for the
Everglades
� Significantly less energy intensive
than desalination processes
� Landfill transportation and disposal
costs not applicable

TREATMENT PROCESSES
� SOURCE
SOURCE - wells can be located near the plant. No
existing users to cause interference (today).
� PRE-TREATMENT
TREATMENT- disposable 5 micron cartridge
filters, pH adjustment, & scale inhibitor.
� MEMBRANES
MEMBRANES – Low Pressure Reverse Osmosis
elements require less power to push water thru screens.
� POST-TREATMENT
TREATMENT – hydrogen sulfide removal with
odor control, disinfection, pH adjustment, blending.
� DISTRIBUTION – connect to existing water main
network without subaqueous crossings.

FLORIDAN PLANT LAYOUT
LOCATION
The Floridan Aquifer wells are not restricted with respect
to specific location in that no other production wells exists
today near the City’s WTP.

FLORIDAN AQUIFER PLANT ISSUES
� Floridan Aquifers can be used for both Aquifer Storage
and Recovery and source water
� Potential increased energy costs associated with lifting i
water and impacts to adjacent users
� Potential for decline in water quality over time
~Some pumping wells become saltier (up-coning of
more saline water from below or laterally along coast)
~ Membrane design and periodic replacement
~Blending with Surficial Aquifer water
� Estimated 125% of raw water to meet treated water
demands
� Concentrate disposal via deep injection well

Fw: WPB/NYC Water Quality Data
Sarah,
We have obtained information about the water supply in NYC as requested. Note that the City of NY
produces about 33 times the amount of water than the City of West Palm Beach. We tried to compile
data that can be comparable. However, NYC act as their own State agency and track different
parameters than the State of Florida. See below for additional information.

Please let know if you want any changes made. NCY produces 1.1 billion mgd per day.
Below is what they say about their treatment process:
Water Treatment
All surface water and groundwater entering New York
City’s distribution system is treated with chlorine, fluoride,
food grade phosphoric acid and, in some cases, sodium
hydroxide. New York City uses chlorine to meet the New
York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water
Act (SDWA) disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a
concentration of one part per million, is added to help
prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 in
accordance with the New York City Health Code. Phosphoric
acid is added to create a protective film on pipes that
reduces the release of metals such as lead from household
plumbing. Sodium hydroxide is added to Catskill/Delaware
water to raise the pH and reduce corrosivity.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent Drinking Water Testing Completed and the Results
The City of West Palm Beach (City) treats surface waters at their downtown facility and
produces drinking water for the residents of West Palm Beach. Residents of the Town of Palm
Beach (Town) receive potable water from the City through a franchise agreement that expires
in the year 2029. Due, in part, to the highly publicized " precautionary boil water" notice issued
by the City in September of 2007, concerns arose regarding the overall safety of the drinking
water supply being provided to the Town. Accordingly, HSA Engineers and Scientists was
asked to collect and analyze additional samples from the water supply. These additional
samples were collected by HSA personnel on November 14, 2008 and were submitted to a
laboratory independent of the ones used by the City for their routine drinking water testing
requirements mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). There are more than 90 testing parameters
that are required to be analyzed on drinking water supplies by the USEPA and the FDEP. HSA
collected samples and tested for all of these drinking water parameters and the detailed results
are supplied in the enclosed tabular summary.
Also as shown in the attached detailed summary table, all of the testing results obtained from
our recent sampling passed and all constituents were well below the allowable limits
established by State and Federal regulations.
What are Trihalomethanes (THMs) and Why Did We Receive a Notice That They Were
Elevated?
During the precautionary boil water notice that occurred during the latter part of 2007, the City
added more chlorine to their finished drinking water to ensure adequate bacterial kill. Chlorine
reacts with natural organics (that cause variations in the water’s color) producing a group of
compounds called Trihalomethanes (THMs). Up to a point, the higher the chlorine dose added,
the higher the THM concentrations produced. The USEPA has established a limit of 80 parts
per billion (ppb) for drinking water supplies. In a few samples collected by the City during the
‘boil water notice’ time period, elevated THM test results were obtained due to the additional
chlorine in the drinking water. This represented a one-time spike in THM results and the
current level is well below the 80 parts per billion limit. During the special testing completed by
HSA, the THM level was measured at slightly more than 50 parts per billion, well below the
acceptable limit set by the regulators.

What Do I Need To Do To Ensure My Drinking Water is Safe?
Aside from the recent test results collected and analyzed by HSA, we reviewed historical test
results, also summarized in the enclosed table. The City produces a safe drinking water of
high quality based on the test results over the last several years. According to the USEPA and
the FDEP established standards, the City’s drinking water supply is of good quality and can be
consumed directly without concern. For those who want an added measure of protection,
substituting bottled drinking water is an option or under the kitchen counter reverse osmosis
(RO) filtration system can be installed as added intermediary treatment to provide an excellent
source of high quality of drinking water. These RO units are not cost prohibitive, can be easily
installed, and can usually supply sufficient drinking water for a typical household. A separate
tap is usually installed near the standard sink faucet so the RO water is delivered on demand.
There are several local reputable vendors that can provide free quotation for installing under
the kitchen counter RO units. Please note that the typical RO unit we are referring to does not
treat the entire household water supply but rather just the water intended for drinking or
cooking purposes.
To add a layer of confidence to residents’ concerns about the quality of the City’s drinking
water, we also recommend that the Town establish a primary point of contact for the City for
courtesy notification and/or discussion of real time details related to issues with the City’s
treatment and distribution processes. This could potentially avoid dramatized response to
typically less-detailed public notification.
INTRODUCTION
Residents of Palm Beach receive potable water from the City of West Palm Beach (City)
through a franchise agreement Town of Palm Beach (Town). As required under rule 62-550,
Florida Administrative Code, to protect the public health and ensure the quality of the delivered
potable water product, these taps are routinely sampled by the City of West Palm Beach’s
Public Utilities Department for specified monitoring parameters. Concerned about assuring the
quality of the potable water product delivered to Town residents by the City, the Town
authorized HSA Engineers & Scientists (HSA) to conduct a one-time sampling event from two
of the sampling taps on the potable water distribution system (piping) serving the Town.
Collected samples were targeted for laboratory analyses for regulated water chemistry
parameters, constituents, and microbiologics most likely to be present in South Florida drinking
water supplies.

CITY OF WEST PALM BEACH’S DRINKING WATER MONITORING PROGRAMS
HSA evaluated the City’s monitoring program and most recent results. Steve Schmidt,
laboratory manager at the City’s water treatment plant and Chris Saliba of U.S. Water,
Corporation, the City’s treatment system process and monitoring consultant, assisted with the
acquisition of sampling protocols and laboratory analytical documentation related to the City’s
drinking water monitoring program. Discussions with both yielded important information about
the City’s drinking water monitoring and quality assurance programs. In addition, records of the
City’s Monthly Operating Records (MORs) and recent results from the City’s water monitoring
programs were obtained from the Palm Beach County Health Department (part of the State of
Florida’s Department of Health, FDOH).
The City conducts two programs to monitor its drinking water quality, a Compliance Monitoring
Program (compliance) and a Routine Monitoring Program (routine). Sampling locations for the
City’s two monitoring programs include the surface water impoundments, inbound raw water,
aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells, treatment plant points of entry, distribution system
points of entry, and distribution system pumps and sampling taps. While Routine program
sampling events generally range from monthly to “as needed”, compliance program sampling
events generally range from daily to quarterly to annually to sampling for contaminants (like
asbestos) every ninth year.
To monitor the drinking water quality delivered to the Town, the City conducts routine sampling
at ten (10) permanent and temporary compliance distribution system sampling points (taps)
situated within the Town’s boundaries. These include:
• Distribution System Tap 3230 (located at 3230 S. Ocean Dr.);
• Distribution System Tap 2780 (located at 2780 S. Ocean Dr.);
• Distribution System Tap PBGC (located at the Palm Beach Golf Course);
• Distribution System Tap SOFS (located at the South Fire Station);
• Distribution System Tap ISRD (located at Island Rd.);
• Distribution System Tap RPBR (located at Royal Poinciana Blvd. X Bradley Pl.);
• Distribution System Tap NOFS (located at the North Fire Station);
• Distribution System Tap 702 (located at 702 N. County Rd.);
• Distribution System Tap LINL (located at List Rd. X N. Lake Wy.); and
• Distribution System Tap IDSE #6 (located at the north end of Ocean Blvd.);
Page 4 of 8
An eleventh distribution system tap, 4201, is located at 4201 South Ocean Boulevard (in the
South Palm Beach municipality), outside the jurisdiction of the Town. The Phipps Park
“Booster” Pumping Station (PS) is located within the Town’s jurisdiction. The Phipps Park
“Booster” is not a point of entry (POE) to the Town’s distribution system. The City’s map
indicates the locations of the sampling taps, the booster pump station, and a one million gallon
(1 MG) storage tank within the Town’s jurisdiction. Figure 1 depicts the distribution system
sampling taps, “booster” pumping station, and storage tank located within the Town’s
boundary.
The City conducts annual compliance sampling at several sampling locations, most notably
from the first point of entry (POE) to the distribution system. According to the City’s Water
Treatment Plant laboratory manager, the first POE is the tap located in the Water Treatment
Plant’s analytical laboratory.
POINTS OF ENTRY FOR THE CITY’S DELIVERY OF DRINKING WATER TO THE
TOWN
Plans of the distribution system serving the Town, provided by the Town’s Public Works
Department (PWD), identified five potable water transmission mains (large diameter pipes)
crossing the Intracoastal Waterway and connecting to the distribution system to deliver the
City’s potable water product to the Town. These five pipes include:
• A 24-inch diameter transmission main crossing the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) from/to
5th Street (in the City) to the eastern flank of the Royal Poinciana Bridge (in the
Town):
• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from/to 45 th Street (in the City) to the
intersection of North Lake Way and Orange Grove Road (in the Town);
• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from the southern end of Flagler Drive
(in the City) to the west end of “Sloan’s Curve (on State Road A1A, in the Town);
• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from the intersection of Southern
Boulevard with Flagler Drive (in the City) to the eastern flank of the Southern
Boulevard Bridge (in the Town); and
• A 20-inch main crossing the ICW from the City to Everglades Island, near Barcelona
Avenue (in the Town).
Page 5 of 8
Figure 1 also depicts the approximate ICW crossings and points of entry (POEs) of the
transmission mains to the Town. The scale of the map does not allow an accurate depiction of
the POEs associated with the mains. Maps of the Town’s distribution system provided by the
PWD, generated at a significantly larger scale, were used to reference the locations of the
POEs for the transmission mains.
SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OF THE DRINKING WATER PRODUCT DELIVERED TO
THE TOWN
As a means to independently evaluate the quality of the drinking water being delivered to the
Town, on November 14, 2008 HSA, accompanied by an employee of the City’s Public Utilities
Department, sampled distribution system tap IDSE #6, representing the northern-most extent
of the system, and tap 3230, representing the southern-most extent of the system,. Figure 1
depicts these sampling tap locations.
Sampling was performed by modification of the City’s (distribution system) General Sampling
Procedures to reflect the intended exclusion of sampling equipment, field parameter testing,
associated equipment calibration requirements. Samples were collected in laboratorysupplied,
unpreserved and pre-preserved containers. As required by select analytical
methodologies, at the sampling locations preservative was added to those sample containers
immediately prior to filling or to the water sample immediately prior to sealing the sample
container.
Collected water samples were submitted to FDOH/NELAC-certified testing laboratories for
analysis for typical public potable water system routine and compliance monitoring parameters
including Primary Drinking Water Standards (excluding select Disinfection Byproducts,
Haloacetic Acids; Bromite; and Chlorite), for Secondary Drinking Water Standards, and for
Total Coliform as listed in the Florida Administrative Code rule 62-550. Test America
Laboratories performed all of the analyses for chemical parameters. Jupiter Environmental
Laboratories performed the analyses for the microbiologics.
RESULTS FROM INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S DRINKING WATER
PRODUCT
Results of laboratory analysis for target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards yielded all
chemical and physical parameters below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than
respective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs).
Results of laboratory analysis for target microbiologicals yielded an absence of Total Coliform
in the water samples collected from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) and southern-most
Page 6 of 8
Tap B (3230). Table 1 arrays the target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards, regulated
MCLs, required sampling frequency, and laboratory analytical results for the November 14,
2008-collected water samples.
Appendix A contains the laboratory analytical reports from HSA’s November 14, 2008
sampling event.
COMPARISON TO RECENT CITY MONITORING PROGRAM RESULTS
The City’s most recent annual compliance monitoring event for Primary and Secondary
Drinking Water Standards was performed in June 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product
was collected at a sampling point (laboratory tap) at the water treatment plant. Analysis was
performed by the City’s FDOH/NELAC-certified, vendor analytical laboratory, Genapure.
Analysis yielded all target parameter results below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than
respective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) per Chapter 62-550, F.A.C.
The City’s most recent quarterly routine monitoring event for Nitrate and Nitrite was performed
in August 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product was also collected at the water
treatment plant’s laboratory tap. Analysis was again performed by the City’s vendor analytical
laboratory, Genapure. The detected concentration of Nitrate was less than the MCL (10 mg/L).
The concentration of Nitrite was below the MDL (< 0.053 mg/L). Nitrate concentrations from
HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are lower than either result reported from the City’s
annual or latest quarterly sampling from the water treatment plant’s laboratory tap. The
difference between these results is not relevant since the reported concentrations from the City
and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL.
Table 1 includes a comparative array of the City’s monitoring program results to the results
from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling for the target Primary and
Secondary Drinking Standards.
APPLICATION OF DISINFECTION CHEMICALS, BYPRODUCTS, AND THE EFFECT ON
TASTE
To eliminate the presence of microbiologics, such as Coliform bacteria, the City applies
chlorine at the treatment plant to disinfect the processed supply water. This treatment process
results in the formation of chemical compounds in the potable water product known as
Disinfection Byproducts (DBPRs). The allowable concentrations of DBPRs in drinking water
are set as Standards in FDEP rule 62-550, F.A.C.
The latest quarterly (3-month) reporting period for the City’s weekly routine monitoring of
DBPRs (Total Trihalomethanes, TTHMs) ended September 2008. The samples of water
Page 7 of 8
product are regularly collected at a series of distribution system sampling taps. Analysis was
performed by the City’s analysts at the Water Treatment Plant’s laboratory. Results from
HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) are directly
compared to the City’s routine sampling of drinking water from distribution system tap LINL
(closest to Tap A). Results from HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from southernmost
Tap B (3230) are compared directly to those from the City’s sampling of that tap. TTHM
concentrations from HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are slightly higher than the
averages of the results reported from the City’s latest quarterly sampling from tap LINL and tap
3230, respectively. The difference between these results is not relevant since the reported
concentrations from the City and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL. It is
noted that the concentration of TTHMs reported from the City’s annual compliance event
(collected at the Treatment Plant) is close to the MCL. This is not unexpected as the sampling
location (treatment plant laboratory tap) is much closer to the point of disinfection than the
distribution system sampling taps. Table 1 includes a comparative array of the detected
TTHM’s from City’s monitoring program to those detected from HSA’s November 2008
sampling event as well as the TTHM Standards per rule 62-550, F.A.C.
The City Public Utilities Department acknowledges that to keep the potable water product free
of microbiologics occasionally requires increasing the concentration of disinfecting chlorine
added to the supply water. This results in brief incidences of potable water product with a
notable change in the taste and higher concentrations of DBPRs. Concentrations of DBPRs
and the stronger taste of chlorine subside with the inevitable reduction of chlorination.
CONCLUSION
As a measure of the quality of the drinking water product being delivered to the Town by the
City, results from HSA’s November 2008 collection of potable water from the northern-most
and southern-most distribution system sampling taps revealed target regulated drinking water
parameters at concentrations below the MCL standards established in FDEP rule 62-770,
F.A.C.
A comparative of the results obtained from HSA’s sampling event to the City’s reported annual
and quarterly results from 2008 monitoring events found minor variations in reported
concentrations for select parameters (see Table 1). These variations pose no concern for the
quality of the potable water product being delivered to the Town since all parameter
concentrations reported from the City’s monitoring events and by HSA’s sampling event are
less than respective MCLs.
Page 8 of 8
Comparison of a three-year average of the concentrations of Primary and Secondary Drinking
Water Standards from the City’s annual compliance monitoring events (circa 2006, 2007, and
2008) to the results from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling reveals
relative equivalence with irrelevant differences between select parameters concentrations since
the averaged City results are less than respective MCLs (see Table 1).
With the exception of the occasional spike in concentrations of DBPRs (and corresponding
stronger taste of chlorine in the delivered drinking water) resulting from the City’s need to
increase the application of sanitizing chemicals (i.e. chlorine) to treat supply water, HSA
concludes that the quality of the potable water product delivered to the Town by the City meets
or beats the criteria for the standards established under rule 62-550, F.A.C.
