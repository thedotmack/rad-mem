Executive Summary
Subject Property Site
The Offering
Stan Johnson Company is pleased to offer to qualified
investors, on behalf of Ownership, a unique pre-sale/
JV investment & acquisition opportunity for a 100%
fee simple interest in a brand new, to-be-built General
Services Administration (GSA) facility. The Property is
leased to the U.S. Government and is occupied by the
Citizenship and Immigrations Services (CIS) agency, and
is located on the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
The proposed deal structure is a forward commitment
acquisition, with the purchaser funding 100% of
development costs, receiving a preferred rate of return
on their outstanding equity during development,
and subsequently purchasing the property upon
rent commencement at a pre-determined cap rate.
Ownership closed on the purchase of the underlying
land in mid-2014 and is ready to start construction
immediately. Qualified investors are encouraged to
submit bids outlining their proposed terms & structure,
to be reviewed by Ownership.
The Property will be developed on an exceptionally well
located site. It will be a 100% occupied, free standing,
two-story office property of approximately 12,770 square
feet on 1.89 acres. The site is located in Smith Bay on
the East side of the island of St. Thomas in the US, Virgin
Islands. The GSA will be operating under a new, 10-year
base lease term.
The subject Property is mission critical to CIS as it will
house a consolidation of multiple CIS facilities including
current facilities in St. Croix and Charlotte Amalie. The
Property will serve as the CIS center for the entire St.
Thomas region to welcome and educate future US
citizens. The Property is a unique opportunity for an
investor to acquire a new construction property 100%
leased to the GSA, while earning additional income
through funding of development costs.

USCIS
Page 11 GSA Investment & Acquisition Opportunity | St Thomas, USVI THE NET LEASE AUTHORITY ®
Tenant Overview
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS” or “CIS”) is a component of the
United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which in turn is under the General Services
Administration (GSA). It performs many administrative functions formerly carried out by the former United
States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which was part of the Department of Justice.
The stated priorities of the USCIS are to promote national security, to eliminate immigration case backlogs,
and to improve customer services. USCIS is headed by a director, currently Leon Rodriguez, who reports
directly to the Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security. USCIS consists of 18,000 federal employees and
contractors working at 250 offices around the world.
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
USCIS is charged with processing immigrant visa petitions, naturalization petitions, and asylum and refugee
applications, as well as making adjudicative decisions performed at the service centers, and managing all
other immigration benefits functions (i.e., not immigration enforcement).
USCIS’ official website is USCIS.gov which includes an online appointment scheduling service known as
INFOPASS. This system allows people with questions about immigration to come into their local USCIS
office and speak directly with a government employee about their case. Additionally, USCIS maintains a
blog entitled “The Beacon” as well as the “@uscis” Twitter account.
Unlike most other federal agencies, USCIS is funded almost entirely by user fees. Under President George
W. Bush’s FY2008 budget request, direct congressional appropriations made about 1% of the USCIS budget
and about 99% of the budget was funded through fees. The total USCIS FY2008 budget was projected to
be $2.6 billion.
Exceptional Credit Tenancy –
Boasting an “AA+” credit rating by S&P and an “Aaa” credit rating by Moody’s, the lease is guaranteed by
the United States of America.
High Renewal Probability –
The General Services Administration’s lease renewal probability is 96% in new, first generation space such
as the Property, and the GSA remains in its space for over 25 years on average.

Location Overview
Saint Thomas is an island in the Caribbean Sea –
directly east of Puerto Rico. Together with St. John and
Water Island, St. Thomas forms a county and constituent
district of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an
unincorporated territory of the United States. Located
on the island of Saint Thomas is the territorial capital
and port of Charlotte Amalie. As of the 2010 census, the
population of Saint Thomas was 51,634 about 48.5% of
the US Virgin Islands total. The district has a land area of
31.24 square miles.
In 1917, St. Thomas was purchased (along with Saint
John and Saint Croix) by the United States for $25
million in gold, as part of a defensive strategy to
maintain control over the Caribbean and the Panama
Canal during the First World War. U.S. citizenship was
granted to the residents of St. Thomas in 1927 and the
U.S. Department of the Interior took over administrative
duties in 1931. American forces were based on the island
during the Second World War and the 1954, passage
of the U.S. Virgin Islands Organic Act officially granted
territorial status to the three islands - St. Thomas, St.
John, and Water Island.
St. Thomas has a lively tourist trade. It is the USVI’s most
cosmopolitan island, yet it still retains the distinctive
atmosphere of a secluded Caribbean paradise. St.
Thomas is packed with many tourism activities including
shopping, sailing, snorkeling, sightseeing, diving and
dining. The Island is home to a world-renowned golf
course, picture-perfect beaches and a spectacular
nightlife. Other attractions are the Skyride (700 feet
above the city) and the famous 99 Steps of Charlotte
Amalie for an incomparable view of the Caribbean, as
well as the second-oldest synagogue in the Western
Hemisphere, the 1680-built Fort Christian.
St. Thomas is developed with many hotels offering a
variety of lodging alternatives from grand resort estates
to small inns and villas. It is also a destination for many
Caribbean cruises due to the Island’s breathtaking views,
secluded beaches and a deeply relaxing atmosphere.
