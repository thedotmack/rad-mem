This is a confidential Offering Memorandum intended
solely for your limited use and benefit in determining
whether you desire to express any further interest in
the purchase of the 38.5-acre site (“the Property”).
This Offering Memorandum was prepared by
Cushman & Wakefield and Commerce Real Estate
Solutions (“Cushman & Wakefield”) and has been
reviewed by representatives of the owners of The
Property (“the Ownership”). It contains selected
information pertaining to the Property and does not
purport to be all-inclusive or to contain all of the
information that prospective purchasers may desire.
It should be noted that all information provided is
for general reference purposes only in that such
information is based on assumptions relating to the
general economy, competition, and other factors
beyond the control of Ownership and, therefore, is
subject to material variation. Additional information
and an opportunity to inspect the Property will be
made available to interested and qualified prospective
purchasers. Neither Ownership nor Cushman &
Wakefield nor any of their respective officers have
made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of this
Offering Memorandum, any of its contents, or any
other materials provided as a courtesy to facilitate
prospective purchaser’s own investigations of the
Property, and no legal commitments or obligations
shall arise by reason of this Offering Memorandum,
its contents or any further information provided by
Cushman & Wakefield regarding the Property.
It is essential that all parties to real estate transactions
be aware of the health, liability and economic impact
of environmental factors on real estate. Cushman &
Wakefield does not conduct investigations or analyses
of environmental matters and, accordingly, urges its
clients to retain qualified environmental professionals
to determine whether hazardous or toxic wastes
or substances (such as asbestos, PCB’s and other
contaminants or petro-chemical products stored in
underground tanks) or other undesirable materials
or conditions are present at the Property and, if so,
whether any health danger or other liability exists. Such
substances may have been used in the construction or
operation of buildings or may be present as a result of
previous activities at the Property.
Various laws and regulations have been enacted at
the federal, state and local levels dealing with the use,
storage, handling, removal, transport and disposal of
toxic or hazardous wastes and substances. Depending
upon past, current and proposed uses of the Property,
it may be prudent to retain an environmental expert to
conduct a site investigation and/or building inspection.
If such substances exist or are contemplated to be
used at the Property, special governmental approvals
or permits may be required. In addition, the cost
of removal and disposal of such materials may be
substantial. Consequently, legal counsel and technical
experts should be consulted where these substances
are or may be present.
Ownership and Cushman & Wakefield expressly
reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to reject any
or all expressions of interest or offers to purchase
the Property and/or terminate discussions with any
entity at any time with or without notice. Ownership
shall have no legal commitment or obligation to
any entity reviewing this Offering Memorandum or
making an offer to purchase the Property unless and
until a written commitment to purchase the Property
has been fully executed, delivered and approved
by Ownership and any conditions to Ownership’s
obligations thereunder have been satisfied or waived.
Except for representations and warranties expressly
set forth in such definitive, executed purchase and
sale agreement, Ownership makes and will make no
representations and warranties regarding the Property
and any prospective purchaser must rely entirely on
its own investigations and those of its agents and
consultants.
By receipt of this Offering Memorandum, you agree
that this Offering Memorandum and its contents are of
a confidential nature, that you will hold and treat it in
the strictest confidence, and that you will not disclose
this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents to
any other entity without the prior written authorization
of Ownership nor will you use this Offering
Memorandum or any of its contents in any fashion or
manner detrimental to the interest of Ownership or
Cushman & Wakefield.
The terms and conditions stated in this section will relate
to all of the sections of the Offering Memorandum as
if stated independently therein. If, after reviewing this

Summary
The Offering
Cushman & Wakefield, Inc., as exclusive advisor, is pleased to offer for sale a remarkable 38.5-
acre development site on the world famous Las Vegas Strip. Situated directly across from the
Mandalay Bay Resort, an investor could obtain permits within approximately nine months to
develop a visionary themed large-scale resort and gaming destination with up to 10,000 hotel
rooms. An approved height allowance of up to 505 feet will make any future development on
the Site the most highly visible on the Strip to the more than 42 million annual visitors travelling
through McCarron International Airport. In addition private aircraft “high roller” terminals
adjacent to the Site create a very unique opportunity to provide exclusive direct jet access points.
Las Vegas gaming revenues, levels of new development, visitor volumes and visitor spending
are all approaching record levels making the timing associated with the development of the Site
extremely compelling.
Las Vegas possesses a unique international appeal that draws an incredible 3.5 million visitors
each and every month. The growth in tourism is only expected to accelerate with McCarran
International Airport anticipated to be the fifth fastest growing airport in the country over the next
10 years with passenger volume projected to reach 55 million. Las Vegas’ growth is expected to
be bolstered by a mix of additional seats by domestic and international carriers through more
flights and larger aircraft and new service from international carriers including nonstop flights
from China within three years. Over 4 million square feet of new convention space and more than
$6 billion of new resort, retail and entertainment developments continue to elevate the overall
“Las Vegas experience”.

Zoning
The Site is zoned H-1. This zoning
provides for full service casino resorts and
is the Strips primary gaming enterprise
designation. Permitted uses include casino
hotels, resort hotels, inns and motels,
apartment rentals and condominiums,
timeshares, public and institutional
buildings, bars, restaurants, retail shops,
and similar uses.
The Site is located within a Mixed-Use
Overlay District. The Clark County Board of
Commissioners approved an ordinance to
the Clark County Code, Title 30 as Chapter
30.48 that established four different
designations for Mixed-Use. The Board
also established a number of Mixed Use
Overlay Districts, with the majority being
along or in close proximity to The Las Vegas
Strip. The Site is within the designation of
MUD-1, the most intense density zoning
primarily located along the Las Vegas Strip
resort corridor. The establishment of the
Mixed Overlay District and the granting of
the land use of MUD-1 make it easier for
properties to receive approvals for mixeduse,
high rise projects.

FAA Approved Height Allowance Up To 505 Feet On The Site
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has provided determination letters for the Site approving a height allowance of 505 feet fronting
Las Vegas Boulevard and decreasing to 354 feet on the eastern portion of the Site. It should be noted that in March 2011 the Clark County
has a Board of County Commissioners unanimously approved the development of the 500 foot observation wheel and retail/convention
space on 10.0 net acres of the Site.

Overview
The Las Vegas Experience
Developed as an entertainment destination, Las
Vegas is driven by a consumer services economy
where “the experience” is its primary commodity.
Las Vegas is one of the most visited tourist
destinations in the United States and it possesses a
unique international appeal that draws a remarkable
3.4 million visitors each month. Identified as the
global capital of entertainment and gaming, it is
the iconic three-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard
known as “the Strip” that draws visitors to Las
Vegas. With 115,000 hotel rooms located on the
Strip, the concentration of tourists is more than
any other metropolitan statistical area in the world.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Association
reported 41.1 million visitors in 2014 and project the
total number of visitors to reach a new market high
of 42 million in 2015.
25
Unparalleled Hotel and Resort Inventory
Las Vegas has a larger supply of hotel rooms than any other metropolitan statistical area in the world and in return drives extraordinary
spending demographics. The vast majority of Las Vegas’ lodging supply is located on the Strip, and approximately 76% of all visitors (31
million) to Las Vegas stay in hotels on the Strip each year. Luxurious mega-resorts as well as more moderately priced accommodations are
concentrated on the Strip and in the immediate surrounding area to meet the needs of all segments of the visitor market. A comparable
resort district cannot be found anywhere else.
As summarized in the exhibit below, 17 of the 30 largest resorts in the world are located on the Las Vegas Strip:

4 Million Square Feet of
Convention Space in Development
The $2.5 billion convention center expansion will generate an
increase in demand of 500,000 visitors per year
Indicative of the strong growth in convention demand, in
February 2015 the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
(LVCVA) acquired the former Riviera hotel located on 23-acres
for $182.5 million. A planned $40 million demolition during
2015-2016 of the former hotel will lay the foundation for a $2.5
billion expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center, increasing
convention capacity to 5.8 million square feet. The expansion
will transform the current convention center, rebranded as the
Las Vegas Global Business District, and support the demand
growth projected to be an additional 500,000 visitors per year.
Phase One is currently underway and includes developing
750,000 square-feet of new exhibit space and 187,500 squarefeet
of supporting meeting space, renovating and upgrading
the existing facility, incorporating touch screens, faster Internet
speeds, new restaurants and an updated façade. Phase II
includes the expansion onto the former Riviera site from a
current total footprint of 3.2 million square-feet to 5.7 million
square-feet of space, with new street infrastructure and new
centralized transportation hub for the entire city. Additionally,
the expansion project will include development of a new office
park in the neighborhood surrounding the center.
In addition to the LVCVA space, 350,000 square feet of convention
space at Mandalay Bay and 1,000,000 square feet of convention
space at Genting Group’s Resorts World are under construction.

Development on the Strip
With approximately $21 billion in high-profile developments completed since 2008, the Strip has attracted significant investment capital
from both ownership entities that already possess a significant stake in the future success of the Strip and new capital sources seeking to
benefit from Las Vegas’ exceptional long-term fundamentals. Resort and casino ownership is largely consolidated among operators that
are devoted to continuing to increase visitation levels by upgrading the Las Vegas experience.

Luxury Resort Hotel Comparables
The following provides an overview of the anticipated competitive set
for a future hotel resort development at the Site. The more recently
opened properties are the Aria (as part of CityCenter) in 2009 and the
Cosmopolitan in 2010 Venetian/Palazzo and Wynn/Encore opened in
January and December of 2008, respectively. New ‘boutique’ entrants
to the Strip opening in 2014 include The Cromwell Las Vegas, an
upscale boutique property backed by Caesars Entertainment and SLS

Gaming Supply and Demand Analysis
Las Vegas is recognized worldwide as a premier gaming destination.
From traditional card and dice games, to slot machines and race and
sports book betting, the casino industry has flourished and evolved
into an international phenomenon. A significant portion of the visitor
revenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry,
which posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.
The initial step in analyzing supply and demand trends within a given
gaming market is to quantify the existing level of gaming inventory.
To quantify gaming supply levels, a review of all competitive gaming
facilities is performed. Once the market’s supply level is known, an
analysis of the demand for gaming facilities is performed.
Unlike traditional economic models of supply and demand, the price variable associated with gaming is largely determined by the consumer.
Gaming is an intangible product: the consumer is purchasing the “experience” and “excitement” casino gaming offers. The price that the
consumer is willing to pay for this experience is known as the “win,” and is quantified on a per-unit basis known as the “win per unit per
day” (WPUPD). Research indicates that the WPUPD, or the price a market can bear for gaming activity, is highly correlated to the level
of available gaming inventory. The actual WPUPD attained by a market, say $100 per gaming position, and provides an indication of the
marketwide demand for gaming. As will be further discussed, these demand levels within a market can be estimated through an analysis of
the actual WPUPD attained by the market. Historical fluctuations in the marketwide WPUPD at various levels of supply can provide insight
into the future demand for gaming. Further impacting the demand for gaming facilities in the market are current and projected trends in
economic and demographic factors such as population base, employment, disposable income levels, and visitation statistics. In addition,
seasonal fluctuations must be taken into consideration when analyzing demand trends.
Once the various demand trends have been identified, a variety of analytical methodologies may be employed to forecast gaming revenue
for an overall market or an individual property.

Gaming Demand Analysis
The win per unit per day (WPUPD) statistic provides the basis for the analysis and projection of table game and gaming device revenues.
WPUPD is calculated by dividing total gaming revenues generated by a particular type of gaming unit by the number of gaming units
available. Overall, the market for gaming devices exhibited high levels of demand and absorption as evidenced by increasing WPUPD and
overall win levels during periods of increasing inventory.
The following exhibit summarizes the strong performance of the Strip gaming market within the industry standard “Casinos earning $72M
and Over”.

Gaming Demand Analysis
Demand for gaming can be classified into four primary sources: the leisure segment, local residents, tour and travel groups and convention
demand.
LEISURE DEMAND
Leisure visitation to Las Vegas is enormous with visitors taking advantage of the year-round favorable climate and multitude of attractions.
The leisure segment utilizes both table games and gaming devices and has a higher propensity to play table games than other segments.
According to the Las Vegas Convention Authority Visitors Profile Study, in 2014 approximately 47% of all visitors mentioned vacation or
pleasure, up significantly from 41% in 2013. Of those polled, 71% of all visitors said they gambled while in Las Vegas with an average
gambling budget of $530.
LOCAL DEMAND
Local demand plays a part in gaming revenue contribution to the Las Vegas market. However, the local segment’s impact on the Las Vegas
Strip is moderate. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, 13% of locals gamble on the Strip with 45% gambling at
least once per week and 75% gambling at least once per month.
TOUR AND TRAVEL DEMAND
Las Vegas welcomed a record 41.1 million visitors in 2014, an all time record. Las Vegas tourism generates more than $45 billion in economic
impact for the local economy and supports 376,000 local jobs. Las Vegas is recognized worldwide as a premier gaming destination. From
traditional card and dice games, to slot machines and race and sports book betting, the casino industry has flourished and evolved into
an international phenomenon. A significant portion of the visitor revenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry, which
posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.
CONVENTION DEMAND
Convention demand within the Las Vegas market is significant. Las Vegas was the most popular trade destination (with a 25% market
share of the Trade Show Week 200 Shows in terms of net square footage) and third most popular convention destination in the nation. In
1990, approximately 1.7 million persons attended trade shows and conventions in Las Vegas; In 2014, convention attendance was up to 5.2
million, an increase of 8% annually over the last 25 years. Future convention expansion in demand is anticipated to see these rates of growth
continue for the foreseeable future.
46
Multifamily Housing and Condominium Overview
With an increase in demand for luxury living accommodations in Las Vegas and a 100% sell out of the existing supply of recently delivered
residential units, condominium prices have increased dramatically. The depth of demand far exceeds the amount of new supply forecasted
over the next five years. In addition, the economies of scale associated with new residential, retail, hotel and office development on the Las
Vegas Strip will only elevate the overall appeal of Strip living - and in turn push condominium values higher.

Las Vegas Retail Market
Overview
The Las Vegas Strip has historically outperformed competitive U.S. retail markets and continues to experience very strong absorption of
new construction, low vacancy rates, and an abundance of retail tenants seeking to access high-traffic pedestrian locations. These factors
together with controlled levels of new development will cause significant long-term rent increases across the submarket.
Increasing Levels of Visitor Spending – More than half of the 41 million visitors to Las Vegas each year spend time shopping along the Las
Vegas Strip. Average per capita visitor spending on shopping, dining and entertainment during 2014 was $815. As demonstrated in the
exhibit below, consumers are allocating a larger percentage of their total spending on shopping and entertainment.

53
Global Retail Location
The Site’s location on Las Vegas Boulevard
is one of the most highly trafficked shopping
and entertainment districts in the world.
Las Vegas’ unique shopping experience is
an integral component of its international
identity as a premier entertainment and resort
destination. Significant increases in tourism
and exciting new resort developments are
attracting new retailers from around the
globe.
Strong Growth in Tourism and Conventions
– Las Vegas tourism and local residents
generate retail revenues exceeding $15
billion per year within a 5-mile radius of the
Site. The Strip is as an increasingly popular
destination for family-oriented and middlemarket
vacations as well as the nation’s most

Under Construction Entertainment Destinations Drive Retail Demand – In addition to mega projects completed in the past few years such as
City Center and Crystals, new projects under construction surrounding the Site will significantly increase pedestrian traffic in the immediate
area. Situated within two block of the Site, MGM’s The Lot, AEG’s The Arena, and Mandalay Bay’s Convention Center expansion will draw
hundreds of thousands of pedestrian foot traffic to the immediate area. Additionally, there are over 450,000 square feet of new lifestyle retail
in planning at Tropicana and Las Vegas Boulevard with the Shops at Tropicana and Excalibur.
Expanding Pedestrian Synergies Between New Retail – The Crystals at CityCenter to the north and the Town Square Las Vegas to the south
have expanded the retail inventory within three blocks of the Site. Each of the retail projects is a Strip-accessible development, encouraging
greater levels of pedestrian traffic along Las Vegas Boulevard. Retailers located within these two projects include: Apple, H&M, Prada,
Gucci, Versace, Tom Ford, Mikimoto, Balenciaga, Wolfgang Puck (2 locations), Katana, Louis Vuitton, Zegna, Rolex and Tiffany & Co.
Strong Residential Demand on the Strip Resort Corridor – The Resort Corridor contains the largest concentration of recent vertical high-rise
developments in the nation with approximately 10,000 new residences within one mile of the Site. The amenity base on Las Vegas Boulevard
has established the Strip as a preferred location for residents.
