SUBJECT: Market Value Appraisal 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
18A-1, 18-61,18-B and 18-W Remainder Estate Smith Bay 
East End Quarter, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands 
Client Reference: 23559 
IRR - Caribbean File No. 172-2015-0181 
Dear Mr. Soltero: 
Integra Realty Resources — Caribbean is pleased to submit the accompanying appraisal of 
the referenced property. The purpose of the appraisal is to develop an opinion of the 
market value of the leased fee (going concern) interest in the property. The client for the 
assignment is Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, and the intended use is for Commercial credit 
administration. 
The appraisal is intended to conform with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP), the Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice of the Appraisal Institute, the Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of 
the American Society of Appraisers, the RICS Valuation Professional Standards, the 
International Valuation Standards, applicable jurisdictional appraisal regulations, and the 
appraisal guidelines of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. The appraisal is also prepared in 
accordance with the appraisal regulations issued in connection with the Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). 
To report the assignment results, we use the Appraisal Report option of Standards Rule 2-
2(a) of USPAP. As USPAP gives appraisers the flexibility to vary the level of information in an 
Appraisal Report depending on the intended use and intended users of the appraisal, we 
Roberto A. Soltero 
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 
December 15, 2015 
Page 2 
adhere to the Integra Realty Resources internal standards for an Appraisal Report — 
Standard Format. This format summarizes the information analyzed, the appraisal methods 
employed, and the reasoning that supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions. 
The subject is an existing 250-slip marina with 5 commercial buildings containing a mixture 
of retail and office space types. The buildings contain 48,661 square feet of rentable area 
and were constructed in multiple stages; with the majority of the construction completed in 
1993. The commercial space is 85% leased as of the effective appraisal date. The marina 
docks were constructed in multiple phases between 1991-1995 and are 52.8% occupied as 
of the effective appraisal date. The total site area is 2.76 acres or 120,226 square feet, which 
includes 0.64 acre or 27,878 square feet, that is re-claimed land. The property also includes 
3.2 acres of seabed under the marina dock structures which is leased to the property owner 
from the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
Based on the valuation analysis in the accompanying report, and subject to the definitions, 
assumptions, and limiting conditions expressed in the report, our opinion of value is as 
follows: 
Value Conclusion* 
Appraisal Premise 
Market Value 
Interest Appraised Date of Value Value Conclusion 
Leased Fee (Going Concern) November 25, 2015 $24,360,000 
*Values expressed in United States Dollars 
Allocation of Going Concern Value 
Amount 	% of Total 
Tangible Property 
Land & Improvements 	$24,250,000 	99.5% 
Tangible Personal Property (FF&E) 	$110,000 	0.5%

Market Value* 	$24,360,000 	100.0% 
*Specifically excluded from the valuation are cash and equivalents and current liabilities. 
The allocation of value components is based on the going-concern premise, which holds that 
the value of a business as a going-concern is equal to the sum of the values of the tangible 
and intangible assets. The allocation assumes continued operation of the marina business. 
Were the marina business to cease operations, the values of the individual components 
would likely be different from the allocated values of the going concern.

Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions 
The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions that may affect the assignment 
results. An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to 
be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions. 
1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel 
and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that 
there is no adverse environmental impact in connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the 
subject property. 
2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate 
northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim 
will arise from the encroachments. 
3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the 
value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial 
statments from ownership that indicates the depreciated book value of these assets. It is beyond our scope 
to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property 
items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this 
allocation exercise. 
The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment 
results. A hypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal 
but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. 
1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis. 
The opinions of value expressed in this report are based on estimates and forecasts that are 
prospective in nature and subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Events may occur 
that could cause the performance of the property to differ materially from our estimates, 
such as changes in the economy, interest rates, capitalization rates, financial strength of 
tenants, and behavior of investors, lenders, and consumers. Additionally, our opinions and 
forecasts are based partly on data obtained from interviews and third party sources, which 
are not always completely reliable. Although we are of the opinion that our findings are 
reasonable based on available evidence, we are not responsible for the effects of future 
occurrences that cannot reasonably be foreseen at this time.

General Information 4 
Purpose of the Appraisal 
The purpose of the appraisal is to develop an opinion of the market value of the leased fee (going 
concern) interest in the property as of the effective date of the appraisal, November 25, 2015. The 
date of the report is December 15, 2015. The appraisal is valid only as of the stated effective date or 
dates. 
Basis of Value 
Market value is defined as: 
"The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all 
conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and 
assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of 
a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 
• Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 
• Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their own 
best interests; 
• A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 
• Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements 
comparable thereto; and 
• The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or 
creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale." 
(Source: Code of Federal Regulations, Title 12, Chapter!, Part 34.42[g]; also Interagency Appraisal and 
Evaluation Guidelines, Federal Register, 75 FR 77449, December 10, 2010, page 77472) 
Definition of Property Rights Appraised 
Leased fee interest is defined as, "A freehold (ownership interest) where the possessory interest has 
been granted to another party by creation of a contractual landlord-tenant relationship (i.e., a lease)." 
Lease is defined as, "A contract in which rights to use and occupy land or structures are transferred by 
the owner to another for a specified period of time in return for a specified rent." 
(Source: The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, Fifth Edition, Appraisal Institute, Chicago, Illinois, 
2010) 
Definition of Going-Concern Premise 
Going-Concern Premise is defined as, "one of the premises under which the total assets of a business 
can be valued; the assumption that a company is expected to continue operating well into the future 
(usually indefinitely). Under the going-concern premise, the value of a business as a going concern is 
equal to the sum of the value of the tangible assets and the value of the intangible assets, which may 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
General Information 5 
include the value of excess profit, where asset values are derived consistently with the going-concern 
premise."

Intended Use and User 
The intended use of the appraisal is for Commercial credit administration. The client and intended 
user is Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. The appraisal is not intended for any other use or user. No party 
or parties other than Banco Popular de Puerto Rico may use or rely on the information, opinions, and 
conclusions contained in this report. 
Applicable Requirements 
This appraisal is intended to conform to the requirements of the following: 
• Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP); 
• Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal 
Institute; 
• The Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers 
• The RICS Valuation Professional Standards;

Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), revised June 7, 1994; 
• Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines issued December 10, 2010; 
• Appraisal guidelines of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. 
Prior Services 
USPAP requires appraisers to disclose to the client any other services they have provided in 
connection with the subject property in the prior three years, including valuation, consulting, property 
management, brokerage, or any other services. The RICS Red Book also contains requirements for 
valuers to disclose previous involvement with the subject property within twelve months. We have 
not performed any services, as an appraiser or in any other capacity, regarding the property that is the 
subject of this report within the three-year period immediately preceding acceptance of this 
assignment. 
Competency 
We hereby confirm that we possess adequate knowledge and skills to perform the assignment 
competently, including an understanding area/regional market conditions, and factors which pertain 
to the property type in question. 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
General Information 6 
Independence 
We hereby confirm that we have no conflicts of interest or material involvement in the property which 
is the subject of this valuation; and that we are acting as unbiased, independent, external valuers. 
RICS Valuer Registration 
We confirm that we are in compliance with the RICS Valuer Registration program, which is mandatory 
for RICS members in the Caribbean region. 
Currency 
Unless otherwise stated, all financial figures in this report are expressed in United States Dollars. 
Scope of Work 
To determine the appropriate scope of work for the assignment, we considered the intended use of 
the appraisal, the needs of the user, the complexity of the property, and other pertinent factors. Our 
concluded scope of work is described below. 
Valuation Methodology 
Appraisers usually consider the use of three approaches to value when developing a market value 
opinion for real property. These are the cost approach, sales comparison approach, and income 
capitalization approach. Use of the approaches in this assignment is summarized as follows: 
Approaches to Value 
Approach 
Applicability to Subject Use in Assignment 
Cost Approach Not Applicable Not Utilized 
Sales Comparison Approach Not Applicable Not Utilized 
Income Capitalization Approach Applicable Utilized 
The income capitalization approach is the most reliable valuation method for the subject due to the 
following: 
• The probable buyer of the subject would base a purchase price decision primarily on the 
income generating potential of the property and an anticipated rate of return. 
• Sufficient market data regarding income, expenses, and rates of return, is available for 
analysis. 
The sales comparison approach is not applicable to the subject because: 
• This approach does not reflect the primary analysis undertaken by a typical investor-
purchaser. 
• There are insufficient sales of comparable properties in this market from which to derive a 
credible value conclusion. 
The cost approach is not applicable to the subject considering the following: 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
General Information 7 
• The age of the property makes estimates of accrued depreciation very subjective. 
• This approach is not typically used by market participants, except for new properties. 
Research and Analysis 
The type and extent of our research and analysis is detailed in individual sections of the report. This 
includes the steps we took to verify comparable sales, which are disclosed in the comparable sale 
profile sheets in the addenda to the report. Although we make an effort to confirm the arms-length 
nature of each sale with a party to the transaction, it is sometimes necessary to rely on secondary 
verification from sources deemed reliable. 
Inspection 
Mark J. Weathers conducted an interior and exterior inspection of the property on November 25, 
2015. James V. Andrews, MAI, CRE, FRICS, ASA, CVA, also conducted an interior and exterior 
inspection on November 25, 2015.

Area Analysis 9 
1 
A mild tropical climate, scenic beauty, and status as a U.S. territory make Virgin Islands appealing for 
vacationers from United States and Europe. The islands host over 2.5 million visitors per year, most of 
whom arrive by cruise ship, and tourism is the dominant economic engine of the islands, accounting 
for roughly 70 percent of the total gross territorial product. 
Each district has its own distinct landscape, mix and intensity of land uses, cultural identity, and 
prospects for future development. St Thomas is home to the capital and the territory's largest city, 
Charlotte Amalie, which has an estimated population of roughly 19,000 persons. St Thomas is the 
primary center for resort tourism, government, finance, trade, and commerce, but its rugged 
landscape limits the land available for agriculture and other types of land-intensive development. 
Charlotte Amalie is also home to a major deepwater harbor that is along major shipping routes to the 
Panama Canal, and it is just east of the Cyril E King International Airport — one of the busiest airports in 
Caribbean. St. Thomas has two cruise ship docks, and is the most frequented cruise ship port in the 
Caribbean. 
The island of St John is just under 3 miles to the east of St Thomas. Cruz Bay is located on the western 
coast of the island and serves as its primary port and link to St Thomas. Nearly two thirds of St John is 
owned by the National Park Service and is off-limits to commercial development. 
St Croix is largest of the three islands, in both land area and population. It is roughly 45 miles to the 
south of St Thomas. Its primary towns are Christiansted and Frederiksted. Overall the island is flatter 
and has more land available for additional agricultural, commercial and residential development than 
St Thomas. St Croix is also the primary manufacturing center for the Virgin Islands, with rum 
distilleries, a major watch-assembly plant, and; until February 2012, one of the world's largest 
petroleum refineries (which recently ceased refining operations). 
History 
The Virgin Islands were originally settled by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named 
by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over 
the next three hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, 
England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway. The Danes developed the islands with 
plantation estates, and the estates boundaries are still used in legal descriptions for land to this day. 
The U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 and the territory was renamed the Virgin 
Islands of the United States. U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927. 
Government 
The U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated United States territory. Even though they are 
U.S. citizens, Virgin Islands residents cannot vote in presidential elections. Virgin Islands residents, 
however, are able to vote in presidential primary elections for delegates to the Democratic National 
Convention and the Republican National Convention. 
The main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the 
Independent Citizens Movement, and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates 
run as independents. 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Area Analysis 10 
At the national level, the U.S. Virgin Islands elects a delegate to Congress from its at-large 
congressional district. However, the elected delegate, while able to vote in committee, cannot 
participate in floor votes. 
At the territorial level, 15 senators-seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of 
Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John-are 
elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature. The U.S. Virgin Islands has 
elected a territorial governor every four years since 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the 
President of the United States. 
Population and Employment 
In 2008, the residential population of the Virgin Islands peaked at an estimated 115,852 persons. This 
follows five years of slow but steady growth of 1.0%, slightly slower than the U.S. annual average of 
1.15%. Since 2008, population levels have fallen each year, to the 2014 estimated population of 
103,961 persons. 
Among the three islands, St Croix and St Thomas are nearly equally populous with St John having less 
than 4 percent of the total population of the Virgin Islands.

The territory's Labor Force has also declined slightly, and there has been a steady increase in the 
unemployment rate; which was further affected by the closure of the Hovensa oil and gas refinery in 
2012. Note that there was a slight dip in unemployement in 2014.

Industry 
The territory relies heavily on tourism for economic stability. Additional industries include the 
production and export of rum; and until early 2012, the production of refined petroleum products (the 
Hovensa Refinery in St. Croix closed in early 2012). The Gross Domestic Product peaked in 2007 at 
$4.85 million, and declined to $4.14 million in 2012, and further declined to $3.79 million for 2013. 
Personal income per capita is also in decline from over $25,000 in 2010 and 2011 to just over $21,000 
in 2013.

The closure of the Hovensa refinery, which was one of the territory's largest employers, also had a 
significant impact on exports which were prevously dominated by petrolium products. Otherwise, the 
territory predominently relies on the tourism industry to support the economy.

Over ninety percent of non-farm jobs are in the service providing industries, with the remaining jobs 
being in goods producing industries. Government, trade, transportation and utilities, and leisure and 
hospitality remain the industries with the largest number of jobs. 
These three sectors account for 69 percent of all jobs. Professional and business services, construction 
and financial activities account for approximately 9 percent, 4 percent and 6 percent respectively. 
Manufacturing and information sectors account for about 2 percent each, while educational and 
health services account for 6 percent. Other services account for the remainder of jobs. 
Tourism 
The total number of visitor arrivals to the territory reached over 2.8 million in 2014, including both air

It is apparent, however, that the amount of visitor expenditures from cruise ship passengers has not 
increased linearly with arrivals since 2009; whereby the ratio was more linear in prior years. Cruise 
passenger arrivals grew 4.94% to over 2.08 million in 2014 following growth of 5.37% in the prior year. 
Total expenditures from cruise ship visitors grew 3.73% to over $345 million in 2013, following growth

In terms of stopover tourists, the U.S. Virgin Islands ranks 7th in the list of the top tourism markets in 
the Caribbean, with 2014 stay-over arrivals of about 730,000. The year 2014 indicated modest growth 
in arrivals, with 3.90% growth over the prior period. The chart below illustrates the relationship 
between arrivals and GDP. We note that the continuing downturn in GDP is likely due to negative 
influences outside the tourism sector, such as the 2012 closure of the Hovensa oil refinery in St. Croix.

Housing / Property 
As the supply of housing has increased in the last two decades, homeownership rates have also 
increased, although only slightly. Rates increased 1.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and 
increased an additional 3.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2012. Average home prices dropped by 
11.8 percent in 2008, but then increased in 2009 and 2010 by 4 percent and 12.3 percent, 
respectively. In 2012, average home prices fell 17.4% and then rebounded in 2013 with an increase of 
22.1%. The average sales price in 2013 was $538,369. Presumably, much of the increased supply of 
new homes and condominiums has gone to non-residents and vacationers. Over the past decade, 
housing costs have accelerated at a far greater pace than resident incomes, putting home ownership 
beyond the reach of all but a few relatively wealthy islanders. 
In 2013, St. Thomas and St. John had an average home sale price of $713,183, while the average home 
sale price in St. Croix was $306,083. While prices have not caught up with what they were in 2007, St. 
Thomas and St. John have seen some recovery in the overall housing market. St. Croix, however, 
continues to suffer from the closing of the Hovensa refinery. In 2014, the average single family home 
sales price in St. Croix was $334,167, while in St. Thomas it was $909,839. 2015 year to date averages 
are show an increase in average single family home price in St. Croix and a decrease in St. Thomas and 
St. John, with averages of $414,178 and $759,811 respectively.

The current situation is that the recovering housing market and general economic conditions on the 
US mainland is slowly having a positive impact in the US Virgin Islands' real estate market in terms of 
overall average home prices as well as the number of homes sold. Home sales in the territory, while 
still lower than 2007 figures, have increased annually since 2012. 
According to statistical data provided by the Multiple Listing Service, the value of real estate sales in 
the St. Thomas-St. Croix MLS grew by 54% in 2014 to nearly $200 million on 883 transactions; volume 
seen since 2008 and sales pace not seen since 2007. This growth follows 20% growth in 2013 which 
came after six years of declines. The average sales price surpassed $300,000, a level also not seen 
since 2008.

Real Estate Ownership and Taxation 
Ownership is "fee simple", under the U.S. flag. There are no restrictions against purchasing solely for 
investment, and no laws dictating when, if ever, you must build on undeveloped land. It should be 
noted that for 2006 there was a reassessment, and the tax rate changed to $3.77 per $1,000 based on 
100% of assessed value (for residential property); however, there was an ongoing court challenge to 
the reassessment, and a federal injunction blocked tax bills until the issue could be resolved. As of 
December, 2013, the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax bills have all been issued under 
the old 1999 assessed values and tax rates. This federal court injunction regarding the tax 
reassessment of VI property values had previously prevented the government from collecting property 
tax for at least four years, resulting in the government losing US$25 million a month. New assessed 
values as well as amended tax rates were released in conjunction with the 2013 tax bills in August, 
2014. Subsequent tax bills were issued at a rate of two per year until August 2015 when the 2015 bill 
were released and the Virgin Islands became current with respect to its property taxes.

Notable News and Developments 
• On January 18, 2012, it was announced that the Hovensa refinery would be permanently shut 
down. This has had a major impact causing an economic downturn on the island, leaving 1,158 
former Hovensa workers unemployed and many more employed by the company's 
contractors according to the United States Department of Labor. Recently, an auction of 
Hovensa's assets was conducted in New York City with multiple qualified bidders, and the 
assets were awarded to Limetree Bay Holdings, a subsidiary of ArcLight Capital Partners. 
Pending approval by the Virgin Islands legislature, ArcLight's operation of the oil storage 
facility will create a minimum of 80 jobs, with the possibility of more in the future. ArcLight 
indicated there could be a possibility of a limited restart of some refinery units at some point 
in the future. 
• Both the Senate and the US House of Representatives passed the Coast Guard Reauthorization 
Act, and President Obama signed the act into legislation in the fiscal year 2015 which should 
help level the charter yacht industry playing field. Prior to 1993 and the imposition of a six-
passenger limitation on US uninspected vessels, the charter yacht industry in the US Virgin 
Islands was thriving, contributing over $100 million in annual revenue and hundreds of jobs to 
the local economy. A large chunk of the industry moved to the British Virgin Islands after the 
six-passenger rule limitation was initiated by the US Government. The bill has recently been 
enacted into law, and the ability of the USVI to compete in this industry should be significantly 
improved. 
• After an extensive search and vetting process, the USVI Government has selected a group of 
local and regional investors to develop a hotel resort on Water Island, just off of St. Thomas. 
There are apparently eight hotel brands in discussions with the developers for branding the 
property. 
• A Texas-based EB-5 Regional Center has announced an EB-5 funded commercial project 
known as the Port of Mandahl Caribbean Conference Resort. When completed, the 
development is reportedly planned to include two full-service hotels, a golf course, a state of 
the art conference center, retail and commercial space, and high-end residential units. EB-5 is 
a type of economic citizenship program whereby the United States grants citizenship to 
investors of certain approved projects in areas where the economic boost is needed. Regional 
Centers are tasked with selling the investments such as limited partnerships to international 
buyers. 
• The Margaritaville (Wyndham) Vacation Club is under construction in Water Bay on the East 
End of the island of St. Thomas. The project is a renovation of the 290-room Renaissance 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
19 
Area Analysis 20 
Grand Beach Resort into 262 timeshare oriented condominium units. The first phase on this 
project was completed in September 2015 and is open, while the second phase is currently 
under construction. 
• The University of the Virgin Islands has announced plans to develop a medical school on St. 
Thomas, which will be operated in collaboration between the hospitals on St. Thomas and St. 
Croix. 
Conclusions 
Economic conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands appear to be slower to recover than many areas of the 
region, particularly in St. Croix, where industrial development had previously been more of a focus 
than tourism The closure of the Hovensa refinery and the failure to facilitate a sale to a buyer who can 
re-open the facility as a refinery will continue to plague St. Croix until other new developments occur 
that can create new jobs. The assets of the refinery were recently sold at auction, but operating 
agreement with the USVI Government only states the buyers will use the oil storage portion in 
addition to constructing an asphalt plant on the property, which projects to only 80 jobs created in the 
immediate future. There appears to be ongoing resurgence in tourism for St. Thomas and St. John, and 
real estate activity appears to be improving; however, many businesses — even those catering to cruise 
ship passengers — continue to struggle. Our forecast is for continued improvement in arrivals and 
hotel statistics, but only gradual economic improvement for the overall territory.

Surrounding Area Analysis 
Location 
The subject is located in the town of Red Hook in the East End area of the Island known as Estate 
Smith Bay. Red Hook is one of the three primary business districts on the island. 
Access and Linkages 
Primary access to the area is provided by Route 32 (Smith Bay Road), a major arterial that crosses the 
east end of the island in a generally east-west direction. This is the primary route through the town of 
Red Hook, one of the three major commercial centers of the island; with the others being the city of 
Charlotte Amalie and the Tutu area. Overall, vehicular access is good. 
Public transportation is provided by Safari Taxi and provides access to all relevant areas. The local 
market perceives public transportation as average compared to other areas in the region. However, 
the primary mode of transportation in this area is the automobile. 
The Red Hook Ferry Terminal offers passenger ferries and car barges on regular schedules to and from 
St. John. Passenger ferry service to the British Virgin Islands is also available. 
The Cyril E. King International Airport is located about 8.4 miles from the property; travel time is about 
25 minutes, depending on traffic conditions. The Charlotte Amalie CBD, the economic and cultural 
center of the island, is approximately 7.0 miles from the property. 
Demand Generators 
The demand for commercial space in the area of the subject is fueled by the popularity of the Red 
Hook business district. Red Hook is a centralized area serving the east end of St. Thomas, and features 
marinas, restaurants, bars, retail shops, and office space. 
The demand for office space in the area has been down due to overall economic conditions. As the 
economy continues its recovery, the demand for well-located office space will increase as well. Retail 
space; however, has seen an increase in demand in this area over the past 12-24 months as shown by 
the low vacancy in the 3 major retail properties Red Hook; American Yacht Harbor (subject), Red Hook 
Plaza and Galleria Shopping Center. 
Compared to the territory area as a whole, the local area has higher income levels. Population trends 
are similar except that the local area is growing at a faster rate than the territory. 
Land Use 
The area is suburban in character and approximately 65% developed. 
Predominant land uses are retail and office uses, with some residential users nearby. Marina use is 
also prevalent in this area. The area contains several neighborhood retail/office centers within a few 
blocks of the subject along Smith Bay Road. These include East End Plaza which is three stories and 
contains mostly office space, the aforementioned Galleria Shopping center which will is anchored by a 
newly opened gourmet grocery store, and the aforementioned Red Hook Plaza which is a two story 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Surrounding Area Analysis 23 
building with a mixture of office and retail. There are other small retail commercial buildings both 
along the waterfront and the inland side of the road; such as restaurants, bars and a convenience 
store/gas outlet. 
In addition to the drawing power of these retail users, the lvanna Eudora Kean High School is located 
approximately 1,500 feet west of the subject property. 
During the last several years, development has been predominantly of retail/office uses. The largest 
recent development in this area has been East End Plaza, which was constructed in 2008. However, 
the completion of this commercial building coincided with the downturn in the overall economy in the 
territory, and the property has struggled to reach stabilization. There is also a newly constructed, 
small commercial strip center in close proximity to the subject called Crosswinds Center that opened 
approximately two years ago. Ace Hardware is the anchor tenant in this building, while the majority of 
the other commercial bays remain vacant. 
There have also been two notable bar/restaurant openings within the past two years, both at the 
subject property. Near the subject, a Senor Frogs restaurant opened in November 2013 featuring a 
dining and nightclub atmosphere. Additionally, a tavern/restaurant called Tap & Still has opened 
approximately 450 feet southwest of the subject. A new Thai/Sushi restaurant is under construction 
within Red Hook Plaza, just west of the subject. These new establishments are indicative of the 
improving retail/commercial climate of the Red Hook area. 
Outlook and Conclusions 
The area is in the slow growth stage of its life cycle. There have been signs of increased demand as 
existing commercial space has been leasing up more rapidly over the past six months, showing the 
upside of the subject's area. We anticipate that property values will slightly increase in the near 
future.

Marina Market Analysis 25 
Marina Market Analysis 
Marinas are not at all homogenous, and the various combinations of business and physical 
components result in significantly different results for the owners and operators. The two major types 
of marinas are coastal (usually found in saltwater inland waterways that lead to an ocean port), and 
freshwater (found on lakes). Saltwater marinas tend to attract larger vessels and require a completely 
different level of maintenance. Freshwater marinas typically cater more toward day-sailors and day-
boaters who do not have personal space with which to keep their boats. 
Typical marinas in both coastal and freshwater locations can include any combination of the following 
components: 
• Wet Slips (covered and uncovered) 
• Dry Storage (land) 
• Dry Storage (stack) 
• Maintenance and Repair Yard and Services 
• Marine Dealerships (boat sales) 
• Merchandise Sales (fishing, boating, sundries) 
• Fuel Sales (gas and diesel) 
• Equipment Rental 
With regard to slip rentals (wet and dry), these spaces can be either rented (the traditional route), or 
sold as "dockominiums" and "rackaminiums." The sellout component became very popular in the last 
decade, and many marinas were converted to all or part sellout type enterprises. Part of the reason is 
that developers in recent times prefer to develop real estate for sale (condominiums or homesites) 
that surround the marina, and in turn could sell the boat spaces and then move on to another 
investment. The market for dockominiums (wet and dry) somewhat dried up during the recent 
recession, and many of the unsold units were subsequently rented instead of sold. 
Another trend of development prior to the 2008 recession was for marinas within luxury resort 
communities that also have a residential component. These include 4 and 5-star resorts in the 
subtropical USA as well as the Caribbean. Typical luxury resort developments planned in the last 
decade would include a hotel (which the developer would license to a "branded" operator), 
condominiums and villas for sale, home sites for sale, and recreational components such as a golf 
course and marina. The sellout types of dock spaces fit well into the business model of the developer, 
as they sell other components and license the hotel operation to a separate entity. 
Marinas also vary in size from small "mom and pop" or "lifestyle" businesses with less than 50 slips to 
large enterprises that attract institutional purchasers. Across the board, marinas are affected by 
economic downturns due to the leisure component of the boating hobby. During the last two 
recessions (2000-2003 and 2008-2009), many marinas went into foreclosure. This created difficulty for 
marinas to obtain financing. 
irr. 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Marina Market Analysis 26 
Coastal marinas along the eastern seaboard were fairly successful until the recent recession, with 
many documenting 100% occupancy or waiting lists. This may be partly due to increased 
environmental regulation limiting dredging new bodies of water or deepening existing ones. As 
marinas are typically close to inlets leading to the sea or inland waterways, they are typically in areas 
that are rich with aquatic life. 
National Boating Trends 
Because of the age, size, design, tenancy, quality, and location of the subject, it is likely to appeal to 
investors primarily on a national or regional basis. While national factors may or may not be indicative 
of the subject's market area, the national trends exhibited are generally indicative of movement in all 
submarkets. Real estate is typically analyzed on a market-by-market basis. Published secondary data 
and market studies for the marina industry on a local or regional level are scarce. Nationwide, the 
most comprehensive statistical reference guide for the marina industry is the Recreational Boating 
Statistical Abstract, published annually by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA). 
The most recent publication reports 2014 data. 
According to NMMA, the boating industry generated $35.4 billion in sales and services in 2013, a 3.5% 
decline from 2013. This represented the first year of decline after three consecutive years of growth 
following the low point in 2010, of $30.4 billion, from the "great recession." The peak occurred in 2006 
at $39.5 billion. 
Of the 242.5 million adults living in the United States in 2014, 35.7%, or 87.3 million people, 
participated in recreational boating; a 1.8% decline from 2013. This is within the range of participation 
over the past four years which varies from 34.8% to 37.8% of the population. 
New boat sales peaked at 912,130 in 2006, but have declined since that date with 2014 sales at 
534,500 units, an increase of 0.44% from 2013. Before the recession in 2007, fuel prices increased, 
followed by increased unemployment and tightening credit. Luxury and leisure goods such as boats 
are typically the first things to be put on the back burner as people become more discretionary with 
their income. As a result, pre-owned power boat represented 64% of all boat sales during 2014, and 
new boat dealers have had to compete. 
While boating participation declined recently, boat registrations have fallen. Boat registrations were 
up 0.08% to 12 million in 2014 versus 11.99 million in 2013. Florida led all states in boat registrations 
for 2014 followed by California, Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in that order. 
The demographic of boat owners is largely middle class. In 2014, 95% of registered mechanically 
propelled boats were 26 feet or less, indicating more affordable, entry-level, trailerable boats. The 
majority (71.5%) of boat owners earn an average household income under $100,000. Over 60% of 
boating participants were between the age of 31 and 64 which signifies that the increase in boating 
population is younger. 
National Marina Industry 
Every December/January, Marina Dock Age magazine publishes an issue dedicated to trends in the 
marina industry. An article from the most recent issue in December 2014 indicates that the majority of 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Marina Market Analysis 27 
marinas and boatyards continue to improve net profits, overall revenues, and occupancy rates, with 
82% expecting stable or increasing occupancy rates.

May 2014, capitalization rates were around 10%. Since May 2014, capitalization rates for marinas 
began decreasing. 
Though the boating industry experienced a decline in revenue and participation during the recession, 
demand for slips far exceeds the current supply. Many industry experts as well as local brokers in

marina sales have indicated that now is a good time to invest in a marina, despite the previous 
recession and limited financing. 
Competitive Marinas 
The most significant supply and demand indicators for the subject are rental and occupancy rates 
experienced by directly competing properties. The operation of a pleasure craft marina provides 
revenue sources which include a mix of various rental, sales and services for the pleasure craft 
operators. Principle revenue stream for pleasure craft marinas includes in-water slips, fuel sales, and 
building rent. 
The subject's asking and average contract rates are shown in the table that follows. The current 
operator is leasing the marina slips by linear feet of vessel length. We have then converted this rental 
income into a rental rate per linear foot of dock space. The subject offers slip rental on a daily, weekly, 
monthly, seasonal and annual basis. The contracted rental rates represent a blend of these rates, from 
daily tenants to long term tenants on annual leases. According to management, approximately 60% of 
the occupants at any given time are seasonal or annual tenants.

We weren't provided with a current rent roll for the marina slips but we were provided with monthly 
historical occupancy and rental rate data. With the transient nature of marina tenants, a historical 
rent and occupancy figures are a more accurate indication of the income properties of the marina. 
Rental rates at the subject, and in this market, are based on a rate per linear foot of vessel length. As 
discussed earlier, the subject contains 105 wet slips with a total of 5,680 linear feet of rentable dock 
space, which indicates a total of 2,073,200 rentable linear feet per year. 
As of the effective valuation date, the subject marina has experienced an overall occupancy rate of 
56.3% for the year to date 2015. We have looked at occupancy rates on an average, annual basis due 
to the seasonal characteristics of this property type in this market. Again, due to the transient nature 
of the tenants in this property type and the short term nature of the leases which can range from daily 
to annually, the overall occupancy rate will be lower than other commercial property types such as 
lodging, multifamily, retail and office. The subject's current occupancy rate is slightly lower than 
historical rates, but the property is considered to be at stabilized occupancy. 
The weighted average contract rate is $37.29 per linear foot per month for the year to date 2015, 
which equates to an average contract rate of $447.50 per linear foot per year.

Marina Market Analysis 35 
Of the comparable marinas in St. Thomas, Yacht Haven Grande is the most superior in terms of 
location, quality and amenities. This marina is typically geared to extremely large vessels such as 
mega-yachts. Crown Bay Marina is slightly inferior to Yacht Haven Grande, but is still superior to the 
subject in quality and amenities. Sapphire Beach Resort, Compass Point and Oasis Cove are all 
considered to be inferior marinas to the subject based on location, quality and amenities offered. 
These marinas mostly cater to live-aboards and smaller vessels. 
The most comparable properties are located in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Nany Cay and Virgin 
Gorda Yacht Harbor are slightly superior to Soper's Hole, but they are all similar in quality and 
amenities as the subject property. The location of the subject in St. Thomas, and its specific location 
within St. Thomas, is considered superior based on convenience. 
The majority of the subject's wet slips (98 out of 105) allow for vessels less than 80'. In this size range, 
the comparable marinas in St. Thomas range from $199.32 - $1,314 with an average of $578.38 per 
linear foot. The comparable marinas in the BVI range from $419.75 - $912.50 with an average of 
$587.65 per linear foot in this size range. The subject's asking rates for this size vessel averages 
approximately $565.75, which is slightly below average but reasonable.

It appears based the land survey provided that a portion of the building improvements does not meet 
the setback requirements by zoning and that the subject is a legal, nonconforming use. However, we

are not experts in the interpretation of zoning ordinances. An appropriately qualified land use 
attorney should be engaged if a determination of compliance with zoning is required. 
The subject is located within a 100-year floodplain related to coastal flooding, which would require 
additional insurance at the expense of the owner. 
The subject site has 765 linear feet of frontage along Smith Bay Road. In addition, the subject has 846 
linear feet of water frontage along Vessup Bay. There is no beach along the waterfront portion; with 
the coastline being that of existing and former mangroves. It is assumed that dredging occurred at 
some point in time which enabled dockage in close proximity to the water line. 
Easements, Encroachments and Restrictions 
Based upon a review of the deed and property survey, there do not appear to be any easements, 
encroachments, or restrictions that would adversely affect value. According to the property survey 
provided, the subject parking garage encroaches the neighboring parcel to the north in two separate 
areas: an 82 square foot area encroaches onto Parcel 18N-1-A A, and a 105 square foot area 
encroaches onto Parcel 18B-2 A. These areas are small in size and the parcels being encroached upon 
are uneconomic remnants of land owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands. As a result, these 
encroachments do not have an adverse effect on the overall value of the subject. Our valuation 
assumes no adverse impacts from easements, encroachments, or restrictions, and further assumes 
that the subject has clear and marketable title. 
Conclusion of Land Analysis 
Overall, the physical characteristics of the site and the availability of utilities result in functional utility 
suitable for a variety of uses including those permitted by zoning. The subject's location along Smith 
Bay Road in the heart of Red Hook, along with its extensive water frontage on Vessup Bay, are major 
drivers of demand and value for marina and commercial use on the site. We are not aware of any 
other particular restrictions on development.

The subject property contains a total GBA of 72,808 and a rentable area of 
48,652. The large difference in area totals is due to a sigi nifi cant amount of 
exterior common areas as well as a 1,406 SF management office. The 
improvements are contained within five total buildings varying from one 
story to three stories. Each building contains a mixutre of retail and office 
space, with the retail spaces generally on the ground levels and the office 
spaces generally on the upper levels. The interior upfits of the spaces vary in 
use, quality and condition but generally are considered to be of good quality 
and condition. Based on the rent roll there are a total of 39 rentable spaces of 
which 10 are upfit as bar/restaurants (3 which share a kitchen), 17 are 
considered general retail spaces, 11 are considered general office spaces and 
one is considered a storage space.

Improvements Analysis — Building Improvements 
Quality and Condition 
The quality and condition of the subject is considered to be superior to that of competing properties. 
The interior and exterior building improvements are considered to be of good quality and in good 
condition based on our inspection. 
Functional Utility 
The improvements appear to be adequately suited to their current use, and there do not appear to be 
any significant items of functional obsolescence. 
Deferred Maintenance 
A few items of deferred maintenance were identified during our inspection and based on discussions 
with management. These include repairs and replacement to the parking garage ceiling, replacing the 
wooden deck on the upper level Building A, and re-facing various portions of the marina jettys. Note 
that a detailed description of the marina improvements will be discussed in the following section of 
this report. To estimate the cost to cure deferred maintenance, we rely on construction estimates 
from management as shown below. 
Deferred Maintenance

ADA Compliance 
Based on our inspection and information provided, we are not aware of any ADA issues. However, we 
are not expert in ADA matters, and further study by an appropriately qualified professional would be 
recommended to assess ADA compliance. 
Hazardous Substances 
An environmental assessment report was not provided for review and environmental issues are 
beyond our scope of expertise. No hazardous substances were observed during our inspection of the 
improvements; however, we are not qualified to detect such substances. There are three 10,000 
gallon diesel storage tanks and one 10,000 gallon gasoline storage tank located unground at the 
subject site. In addition, there is a marine fueling dock located on the marina. We have assumed there 
is no environment damage to the subject property as the result of these fuel stations and unless 
otherwise stated, we assume no hazardous conditions exist on or near the subject. 
Personal Property 
No personal property items were observed that would have any material contribution to market 
value.

Improvements Description and Analysis 46 
Overall, the quality, condition, and functional utility of the improvements are above average for their 
age and location. The subject benefits from good access and visibility from both the waterfront and 
the main thoroughfare of Smith Bay Road. In addition, the overall quality and condition of the subject 
is above average for this market. Due to the small site size and large number of commercial tenants, 
there is insufficient parking at the subject based on market standards. 
Improvement Analysis — Marina 
The marina currently contains 105 wet slips, although that number can vary somewhat depending on 
the size (width) of the occupying vessels. Each designated slip is supplied with its own electrical outlet 
and fresh water supply, as well as access to a refueling line. The individual slip sizes can vary based on 
boater needs, but they can accommodate a variety of vessels, typically within the range from 30 to 79 
linear feet for the standard slips, and 79 to 110 linear feet for the T-head slips. In addition, some slips 
have an attached finger for easier access, which is considered more desirable. 
Generally the jetties and slips are constructed of PVC pilings bored and filled with concrete and steel; 
and wood plank surfacing. Many of the smaller slips are horizontally separated by wooden columns 
used to tie up vessels rather than there being jetties between each slip. 
The physical docks were constructed over several years, from 1991-1995, and are considered to be in 
average condition. Ongoing renovations have been made to the docks throughout the years, with 
upcoming expenditures included a complete resurfacing as well as re-facing the wooden skirts on 
most concrete pilings. The docks consist of mostly concrete pilings and cross braces with some wood, 
along with wooden skirts and wood decking surface. There have been no major renovations to slip 
structure within the past five years. 
The subject marina benefits greatly from its location in Vessup Bay, which is well protected and 
positioned in a convenient area at the heart of Red Hook. In addition, this bay has a direct route to St. 
John and the British Virgin Islands and has a depth that will accommodate vessels with a maximum 
draft of 10 feet and a maximum vessel length of 110 feet. The subject is one of the closest commercial 
marinas to both St. John and the BVI, and this convenient location is a major demand generator for 
commercial charters as well as vessels based in St. John and the BVI which are often in need of a 
fueling station. The quality and condition of the docks is considered to be average; however, the 
services and amenities offered at this marina are considered to be above average.
