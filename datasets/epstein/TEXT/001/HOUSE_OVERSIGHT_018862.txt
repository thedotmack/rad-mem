Prosecutor's home destroyed in suspected arson on St. Croix
By LOU MATTEt
Daily News Staff
ST. THOMAS - v.1. Police and .
V.1. Fire Service officials on St.
Croix are investigating what they
say is suspected arson at the home
of a criminal prosecutor for the v.1.
Attorney General's Office.
The Estate St. George home of
Assistant Attorney General Kip
Roberson was fully engulfed in
flames when five Fire Service trucks
responded to a 911 call about 11
a.m. Thursday, according to St.
Croix Fire Chief Angel Torres Sr.
and Attorney General Vincent
Frazer.
Torres estimated that the borne
had been burning for about 15 minutes
before the call came in. He said
firefighters had to force their way
through a motorized gate to gain
access to the burning house. No one
was inside, and no one was hurt in
tbe blaze, but the home was completely
destroyed, Torres said.
"It's a total loss," Torres said.
Torres said firefighter.; also found
that surveillance cameras at the
. home had been tampered with.,
"Someone cut the wires," he said.
"The wires was pulled out and the
screens were pulled out and thrown
in the bushes."
Torres said firefighters found evidence
of tampering on the doors to
the home, which appeared that
someone had tried to pry the doors
open. The Fire Service did not leave
the scene until 3:20 p.m., Torres
said.
Torres -said Thursday evening that
the Fire Service bad not contacted
any witnesses at that point and that
Roberson's borne was located in an
isolated area. He said he believed
Roberson shared the home with
another attorney, but he did not
know the attorney's name.
"Apparently they were a couple,
but it's an ongoing investigation,"
Torres said. "We gotta really follow
up on some leads and stuff we're
looking at."
Roberson could not be reached
for comment Thursday evening.
Frazer declined to comment about
Roberson's living situation. The
attorney general said late Thursday
Elections boards' slow vote count violates V.I. law
By LOU MATTEI
Daily News Staff
ST. THOMAS - Both Boards of Elections
in the VIrgin Islands have run afoul of the V.I.
Code and board policies in the wake of
Tuesday's general election, from which paper
ballots are still being tallied.
The V:1. Code requires the boards to count the
votes for each candidate within a day of receiving
ballot materials from the polling places:
''Each board of elections, afIer having received
all statements, books, lists, papers, vouchers,
ballots, ballot boxes and district register from
each polling district and polling place in its distric�
shall convene not later than one day following
the receipt thereof and determine the total
number of votes cast in the election district for
each candidate."
. The law states that the boards must convene
no later than three days afIer receiving the aforementioned
materials to tally votes for the Board
of Education and Board of Elections races.
On Tuesday, a majority of the votes from all
races were cast on electronic machines, and
results from those ballots were available within
hours of the polls closing.
However, widespread diSbUSt of the machines
led to a spike in the use of paper ballots - more
than 4,500
vote count and, in effect, hampered the boards'
abilities to comply with the law.
Today marks the third day since the boards
received all the ballots from the polling sites
Tuesday night.
The St. Thomas-St. John Board hopes to fiuish
counting the Senate races by the end of the
day today before moving on to other races,
according to board member Lorna Thomas.
The St. Croix Board is scheduled to begin
counting its 2,781 paper ballots today.
Thomas, who helped on Thursdsy to oversee
her board's tally of about 600 ballots in the

St. Croix Board of Elections member Lisa
Harris Moorhead looks on as board members
and election judges sort and count ballots
Thursday. The board issued a statement
Thursday that it had finished sorting more

them today at the Election System Office

in

context of the territory's clUTen! paper baBots,
which can be counted only by hand.
"Literally it would have been impossible to
follow," Thomas said when asked abou� the law.
"I don't see how we could have done that."
Thomas said the board should have new voting
machines by the 2014 elections that can tally
paper ballots automatically.
When asked about enforcing the section of
the law cited above, V.1. Attorney General
Vmcent Frazer said he "would have to look at
that and see."
The boards' handling of the paper ballots also
has brought them into conflict with a Board of

Elections policy.
Joint Board of Elections Chairman Rupert
Ross Jr. said Thursdsy that the joint board passed
a policy earlier this year requiring the boards to
begin counting any paper ballots the night of the
election. He said the policy never was put into
writing, but it may exist in some fonn in minutes
from the meeting. He also said the policy lacked
an enforcement mechanism.
Ross said the intent of the policy, which
passed by a 6-5 vote, was to ensure that processing
of the paper ballots began as soon as possible.
The sooner the counting begins, the easier it
is to comply with another section of the law that
requires the boards to certify a fiual vote count
within 10 days of an election, Ross reasoned.
The certification deadline already was weighing
on the mind of Thomas, who pointed out the
St. Thomas-St. John Board has yet to louch
locked ballot boxes containing absentee ballots
�d walk-in votes.
Elections Supervisor John Abramson Jr. has
said the district processed ·412 walk-in ballots
and mailed 331 absentee ballots.
But Thomas was optimistic that the board was
gaining momenttun afIer a troubled start.
"Tempers were a little tight yesterday, but
everyone's happy today," Thomas said. "The
public was much quieter and accommodating
judges to do their jobs."
Candidate Lawrence Olive, who earned 304
paper-ballot votes on Thursday to bump Lisa
Williams from ninth place in the Senate' race.
said he told his supporters to use the paper ballots
as a more reliable - and legal- alternative
to the electronic machines.
"If the trend continues, I don't see no reason
"(hy 1 will not be in the top seven," Olive said.
"It just goes to show you that the paper ballot is
the true count."

that he had not yet been fully briefed
on the fire, but he had a deputy on
st. Croix looking into the question
of whether the sijspected arson could
be connected to any cases Roberson
was working.
"1 hope not, but we will look into
that," Frazer said.
Torres said the fire remains under
investigation by the Po lice
Department's forensics unit and the
Fire Service's arson prevention unit.
Anyone with information about the fire
can call the Fire Service at 773-8050
and ask for the arson prevention unit.

Sen. Alvin Williams Jr. charged with
bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud
By ALDETH LEWIN
Daily News Sta ff
ST. THOMAS � Sen. Alvin Williams Jr. was arrested
by federal agents Thursday and charged with bribery,
mail frand and wire fraud.
The proceeds of Williams' criminal activities
$1.1 million, according to a statement from the U.S.
Attorney's Office.
About 4 p.m. Thursday, almost a dozen 10 FBI agents
converged on the v.1. Legislature building on St.
Thomas. according to several eyewitnesses.
The agents went inside and came out escorting Kim
Blackett, who is listed on the Legislature website as
Williams' chief of staff . Blackett also was charged in an
indictment filed Thursday.
Another staff member also was charged, according to
the U.S. Attorney's Office, which did not release
.
the person's
name.
Senate President Ronald Russell said he was on St.
Croix at the time the agents arrived at the Legislature,
but he was informed of the arrest. Russell said he was
told that Williams had surrendered to law.enforcement
officers.
"He turned himself in, that's what" I understand,"
Russell said.
Russell said he had no additional information
Thursday.
In October 2011, about 25 federal and local law
enforcement officers raided the St. Thomas Senate
building and·Williams' office.
A federal grand jury handed up an indictment
Thursday charging Williams, Blackett and a third person
with operating and participating in crintinal activities
including bribery, wire fraud and mail fraud, U.S.
Attorney for the District of the Virgin Islands Ronald
Sharpe said in a prepared statement
The indictment has not yet been posted by the District
Court. However, the statement from Sharpe includes a
number of details from the charging dOCuments inclnding
that Williams is accused of:
• Attempting to bribe Public Works Commissioner
Danyl Smalls with $10,000 in cash.
• Accepting bribes from the developers of Raphune
VIstas.
• Accepting $35,000 in bribes from the developers of
the wind twtines atTutuParkMall.
• Soliciting kick-hacks from his own staff in exchange
for salary raises.
• Committing wire frand by using public funds to pay
for courses and having staff members submit work in
his name to obtain an online degree in his name from
.
University of Phoenix.
According to Sh3Ipe, if Blackett and Williams are
convicted, they face a maximum 20-year prison sentence
and up to $250,000 in fines.
Public Works
On Sept. 5, 2009, Williams gave the V.I. Public
Works Commissioner $10,000 in cash in an attempt
to bribe him to give contracts to Ace Development
Inc., a company in which Williams had an interest,
Sh3Ipe said.
In his answers to a Daily News candidate questionnaire
for the 2006 Voter Guide, Williams said he was
'the owner of Ace Development Inc.
At the time, Darryl Smalls was the Public Works
Commissioner. When The Daily NeWs reached Smalls
on Thursday night, he said he had no comment.
Raphune Vistas
Sen. Alvin Williams Jr.
Between Feb. 21, 2007, and Nov. 18, 2011,
Williams solicited a bribe from the developers of the
Raphune Vista housing development project on St.
Thomas, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. The
indictment says Williams promoted legislative action
and supported the authorization of funding and zoning
of the project in exchange for which Ace
Development received a contract related to the construction
of Raphune VIstas, Sh3Ipe said.
As part of the contract, Ace Development used
and/or rented. construction equipment to the developers,
Sh3Ipe wrote.
In May 2009, the Senate approved a zoning change
for Oceanside Villageinc., the developers of Raphune
Vistas, from R-l, residential low density one- and
two-family, to R-4, residential medium densityagainst
the recommendations of the V.I. Department
. of Planning and Natural Resources.
In June 2009, Gov. John deJongh Jr. vetoed the
zotting change.
Tutu wind turbines
In September 2008, Williams asked for and received
a $10,000 campaign contribution from the developers of
the Tutu Park windinill pmject as a bribe to snpport legislation
supporting the project, Sharpe said.
Williams also solicited $25,000 in campaign contributions
from the wind turbine developers between
September 2008 and September 2009 ;according to
the federal prosecutor.
A number of companies were involved with the wind
twtine project, including Green Power Electric; Dallasbased
Earth, Wind and Power; and Island Wmd Power.
When the Senate passed a comprehensive renewable
energ)' bill in 2009, an amendment was tacked
on to change the zoning code to allow wind turbines
in B-1 and B-3 business zones without having to seek
separate zoning approval. The legislation also would
have allowed wholesale renewable energy production
in B-4 and B-3 zones.
The measure was line-item vetoed by deJongh in
July 2009.
Campaign funds and false reports
From January 2006 to December 20 II, Williams
and a legislative staff member failed to deposit-certain
campaign contributions; withdrew funds from a
campaign account; and submitted false campaign disclosure
reports that failed to include certain contributions,
accoraing to Sharpe.
Kick-backs from staff
In the summer of 20 1 0, Williams tried to solicit
kick-backs from his own staff in exchange for giving
them salary increases, the statement from the U.S.
attorney's office said.
. According to Sharpe, the staff I11:embers were supposed
to withdraw a portion of the increased salary in
cash and give it to Williams.
From September 2010 to July 2011, Williams
received such a bribe, Sharpe said.
University of Phoenix
From April 2007 to February 2008 and from January
2008 to October 2011, Williams and a staff member
committed federal wire fraud as the senator sought
online degrees from the University of Phoenix.
"The indictment alleges that the staff member
falsely submitted various documents that were generated,
created and authored by others under the
direction of and in the name of Williams," Sharpe
said in the statement.
From January 2008 to October 2011, Williams and
Blackett defrauded the government by using public
funds for non-legislative purposes, namely pursuing an
online degree for Williams, Sharpe said.
"N; the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Department
of Education, the Office of Inspector General will
aggressively pursue anyone who games the Education
system for their own selfish purpose," Special Agentin-charge
of the U.S. Department of Education Office
of Inspector General Yessyka Santana said in a written
statement.
The investigation
The investigation leading to the indictment was
conducted by the Public Corruption Task Force, a
joint federal and local team.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Kim Lindquist, Nolan Paige and Kelly
Lake.
''The prosecution of public corruption is a top priority
of the U.S. Attorney's Office," Sh3Ipe said . .'�It
is a· breach of the public trust for public officials to
use their office for personal gain."
"These individuals have allegedly 'abused their
powers by utilizing their positions to discreetly conduct
illegal activities," IRS-CI Special Agent-incharge
Jose Gonzalez said Thursday. "JRS-CI is committed
to following the money trail to ensure that
public officials who use their office to line their own
pockets are brought to justice and deprived of their
ill-gotten gains."
Sh3Ipe asked anyone with direct knowledge of illegal
acts or information on corruption in the Virgin
Islands to call the Public Corruption Task Force at
71!H;516.

Boras: Dodgers 'bought store,' Mets 'in freezer'

By RONALU DLUIVI
The Associated Press
INDIAN WELLS, Calif. - With
baseball awash in record revenue as the
signing season starts, Scott Boras compares
the habits of teams to families
sifting through supermarket shelves.
At the winter meetings in Dallas last
year, the agent had this to say of the
financially troubled Los Angeles
Dodgers and New York Mets:
''Normally, they're in the steaks section,
and I found them in the fruits-andnuts
category a k>t."
Since then, the Dodgers have been
sold for $2 billion. Tbe Mets owners
have agreed to 'pay up to $162 million
- and likely much less - in a deal
with the trustee for Bernard Madoff's
fraud victims.
So on Wednesday at the general
managers' meeting, Boras said his view
of the Dodgers had changed.

said.

the lowly San Diego Padres were
bought for $800 million.
Since the Dodgers were bought last
spring by a group headed by Mark
Walter, Stan Kasten and Magic
Johnson, they increased their payroll
by about $35 million, adding infielder
Hanley Ramirez, first baseman Adrian
Gonzalez, closer BrandoD League,
pitcher Josb Beckett and outfielder Carl
Crawford.
The Dodgers' payroll next year
might approach or surpass that of the
New York Yankees, who have topped
spending every year since Los Angeles
edged them by $1 million in 200 I.
New York is vowing to cut its payroll
by 2014 because of changes in the collective
bargaining agreement that will

Boat captain arrested in 2011 death of parasailor
By LOU MATTEI
Daily News Staff
ST. THOMAS - Boat captain
Kyle Coleman was arrested
Wednesday on a charge that he
caused the 2011 death of a parasailor
through misconduct, negligence
and inattention to his duties, the
U.S. Attorney's Office announced
Thursday,
Coleman, the captain of the motor
boat Turtle, was conducting parasailing
excursions just south of
Water Island on Nov, 15,2011,
according to a press release from the
U,S, Attorney's Office,
Bernice Kraftcheck and her
daughter, Danielle Haese, were
hoisted into the air for the parasail
(ide as wind conditions were
deteriorating.
"The strong winds and a weak
tow-line caused th.c tow-line to
break, resulting in the parasail separating
from the vessel and the two
women falling into the water," the
statement reads. "The wind then
propelled the parasail, with the
women still attached, at a very
high rate of speed causing the
death of Kraftcheck and serious
injuries to Haese."
The U,S, Coast Guard "aggressively
investigated" the accident,
which led to Coleman's arrest and
the surrender of his merchant mariner's
license in June, according to a
prepared statement by Capt. Drew
Pearson, the Coast Guard's San Juan
commander.
�
"The Coast Guard takes safety at
sea very seriously, and will ensure
that. any mariner who causes anoth:
er's death through misconduct, negligence,
and inattention to his duties
is held accountable in a court of
law," Pearson said in the release,
A medical examiner pronounced
Kraftcheck, 60, of Round Lake, IlL,
dead at the West Indian Co, dock the
afternoon of the accident. Haese, 34
at the time, of Plymouth Meeting,
Pa., was hospitalized overnight at
Schneider Hospital.
The women were passengers
aboard the Celebrity Eclipse and
bought a parasailing shore-excursion
operated by Caribbean
Watersports and Tours.
The one-count grand jury indictment
charging Coleman was not
available on the District Court's
online court records database as of
Thursday night
Coleman, 32, made his first
appearance before U.S. Magistrate
Judge Ruth Miller and was released
on a $10,000 unsecured bond,
according to the release. He is
scheduled to be arraigned in District
Court on Nov, 14, one day shy of
the one-year anniversary of
Kraf'tcheck's death,
"If convicted, Coleman could face
up to : 0 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine,

Im
Nelson tells Luis' board that hospital is still falling short of standards
By JOY BLACKBURN
Daily News Staff
ST. CROIX - Luis Hospital Chief
Executive Jeff Nelson updated board
members about the hospital's status
with federal regulators during a meeting
Thursday night
Luis remains under the regulatory
microscope with the federal Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services
- and the hospital's certification
from the federal agency is potentially
at stake.
CMS certification indicates a hospital
meets certain standards, and if a
hospital is decertified, it is no longer
eligible to receive payments from the
federal agency for services the hospital
provides to Medicare and
Medicaid patients.
Revenues from eMS patients represent
about 60 percent of the hospital's
income, Nelson said Thursday, .
The hospital currently is operating
under two settlement agreements
with CMS, aimed at fixing problems
found by inspectors from the federal
agency during inspections in recent
years.
One of the agreements involves
the entire hospital.
Nelson on Thursday said that tile
hospital recently had received a statement
of deficiencies from CMS after
inspectors conducted a follow-up,
focused survey in Sep,tember as part
of the monitoring on that agreement.
Inspectors had found some
improvements, "but not enough,"
Nelson said Thursday,
The hospital has submitted a plan
of correction for the deficiencies, but
the federal agency said that the plan
was not creative or detailed enough,
Nelson told the hoard,
Hospital officials will work on the
plan of correction, and once CMS
approves it, the elements of the plan
will he part of the overall settlement
agreement, Nelson said after the
meeting.
Luis has until Feb, 13 to meet the
federal agency's mandates for
improvement or it potentially will
lose CMS certification - although
Nelson said the surveys could come
sooner.
"We may see CMS here as early as
mid-December," Nelson said.
The hospital also is in the process
of temporarily shutting down its psychiatric
unit for 90 days in" an effort
to make improvements in that unit,
officials said. Luis.is working with a
hospital in the United States to come
to an agreement to temporarily transfer
its patients there, officials said.
The plan to temporarily close the
lmit prompted considerable discussion
at the meeting. Some advocates
for the mentally ill, as well as some
physicians, raised questions about the
wisdom of the move.
Board members said it was necessary
to make improvem .
ents to the
wUt so that the hospital can keep the
unit open in the long-tenn.
The other settlement agreement
Luis Hospital has with CMS is for
the dialysis unit
The hospital has met the federal
standards for that unit, but the settIement
agreement remains in place
because CMS wanted to ensure that
the positive changes were sustained,
Nelson said.
That settlement agreement has
been extended once, and Nelson told
board members Thursday that he
anticipates it will be extended again
for further monitoring, although be,
did not know for how long.
In other action, the board discussed
and approved reports and a variety of
recommendations from its Finance
Comminee. It also approved a policy
related to public access to board
meeting minutes. Board chairwoman
Kye Walker said the document puts
the board's current practices into a
policy,

-EDITORIAL OBSERVER­
An invigorated second term
From The Ne w Yo rk TImes:
Early Wednesday moming, as sleep-deprived supporters rallied for a final
cheer, President Barack Obama concluded his re-election campaign with a
promising glimpse at what the fight was all about: a second-term agenda that
can make real progress on issues neglected in the first.
Without question, the president intends to build on and improve the significant
accomplishments of the last four years, particularly the full implementation
of health care reform and the use of government policy to keep the economy
growing. But the president went beyond that in his victory speech and
added some less familiar words to his policy vocabulary.
Children should live in a world that is not burdened by debt or weakened by
inequality, he said, but also one "that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a
warming planet." That suggests he knows he has an opportunity to address climate
change with more vigor, going beyond auto-mileage standards and renewable-energy
jobs to possibly advocating tougher carbon emissions standards.
The president also said he was looking forward to working with Republicans
to fix the immigration system, giving him a chance to do more than promote
the DREAM Act for young immigrants. He could lead the way to comprehensive
reform that combines strong enforcement with a path to citizenship for
immigrants already here. He also hinted that combating poverty might move
higher on his priority list.
And he spoke of tax reform, an issue that will immediately begin to grow
louder with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts at year's end. Obama won
re-election on an unambiguous promise not to renew those cuts for incomes of
$250,000 or more, and his supporters eXpect him to stick to that vow. In coming
months, after he persuades Congress to keep taxes from rising on the middle
class, he should push to restore a fair estate tax and raise the low capital
gains rate to the level of ordinary income.
He even mentioned the need to fix a balloting system that left thousands of
people standing in long lines to vote this week, a tantalizing hint that electoral
reform might become a priority.
All these agenda items require the same ingredient: ending his standoffish
attitude toward Congress and working closely with any leader or lawmaker
willing to make real progress. That may be easier now that Senate Democrats
(and their independent allies) have expanded their majority by two seats to 55,
many of them filled with newcomers more liberal and feisty than their predecessors,
most notably.ElizaMth Warren ofMassachuseUs.
The new Democratic caucus' first order of business should be a reform of
the filibuster that prevents its routine abuse by Republicans, and the majority
leader, Harry Reid, suggested Wednesday that he supported some modest
changes. The newcomers, along with the White House, should forcefully
advocate Iliat he go as far as possible,
A newly energized Obarna administration and Senate could have the effect of
isolating the supply-side dead-enders in the House. John Boehner, the House
speaker, announced Wednesday that nothing had changed; he and his caucus
still oppose higher tax rates for the rich and still want to pursue Romney's
defeated goal of raising revenue by lowering rates and cutting unspecified loopholes.
Standing up to Republican recalcitrance on this and many other issues
will require bringing to bear political pressure from the coalition that gave
Obarna a commanding victory in the Electoral College on Thesday.
The president's victory was decisive, and many who didn't support him
nonetheless told pollsters that they agreed with his positions on taxes, health
care and immigration. He now needs to use the power that voters have given
to him to enhance and broaden his agenda.

u.s. politics changes for the better
America has changed.
There are periods when we grow as
a society in degrees. Then there are
times when we take great leaps forward.
If you examine the history of
our country back to the days of the
first Spanish, English and French
immigrants, you will see certain
moments when our national dynamic
shifted.
1bis week, we saw a moment when
the America that has been growing and
changing by degrees met with a
moment when America made a hard
tum on its path.
For years we have seen the browning
of America. For years we have seen
the tolerance and acceptance level of
different religions, economic conditions,
sexual orientations, political
beliefs and ancestries grow in measured
steps through the increase in on.,.
on-one interactions and social media. -
For years we have seen the steady
progress of women, and felt a subtle
shift in the rllythm of America.
This week, we saw several of these
trends converge in a moment when it
became evident that once again,
America has changed.
The demographics of the exit polls
tell an interesting story. President
Obama's support came overwhelmingly
from groups of people who are often
described as disenfumchised:
• Those who make less than $50,000
per year;
• Those with some or no college
education;
-Women;
• Young people;
• People of color.
These groups, who in the past have
felt like their votes were taken for
granted, for the first time in a long time,
saw their votes carry weight that makes
them get noticed.
People more "wonky" than me will
�®2P'??'�\b5T.�i2m'
Mariel Blake
be going over these numbers for
months to come. These numbers tell
me, though, that the reason why so
many people were surprised about the
outcome in this race ignored the numbers
that had nothing to do with polls.
They want to say that it is because
these communities were voting to keep
their entitlements and "handouts," but
that is just a denial of the real truth.
What people want is to no longer
feel disenfumchised and marginali:ml
What people want is for their voices
to be included, not shouted down.
Recent data shows that women now
outnumber men by a slim margin.
More people live in cities. People of
color now make up alinost a third of
the population. The average age is 37.
Almost two thirds of us own homes,
but there are more of us who have
either never been married or are
divorced than there are those ofus who
. are martied.
The fastest shrinking - demographic
is white men.
So many of the people who fit the
demographics that elected President
Obarna are those in demographics that
are seeing their numbers grow and also
are becoming more politically active
and savvy. They are truly looking to
connect with candidates who have their
concerns in mind. These are not one
issue voters.
They care about the economy but
they also care about their place in our
society. They want their social issues to
be a part of the discussion. Our national
identity is more about inclusion than
assimilation. This is a vast switch from
wbere we have been
Those of us in groups that have been
considered on the fringe ·or in the
minority have found solidarity in our
experiences in this country and are
increasingly deciding we are no longer
satisfied with trying to fit in and would
rather have a seat at the table as our
unique selves.
Women, the LGBT community and
Latinos made great strides with this
election. AfricanAmericans and young
people reminded the political parties of
the value of their support.
There is a lot of finger pointing from
the Republican .talking heads as to why
their candidate lost. It seems they are
slowly coming to realize it was not
only whom they ran as candidates but
also where those candidates stood on
issues that are important to this growing
voting power block.
I was struck by how few people of
color were in the crowds for Mitt
Romney toward the end of the campaign.
It was like they no longer cared
about even the illusion of inclusion,
and instead decided to hank their future
on their main demographic. What their
campaign failed to take into consideration
is that the issues that matter most
to people right now stretch across racial
and gender lines.
Those of us usually considered on
the fringe are multifaceted and have
learned a very powerful lesson after
this election. When we band together
to get our issues on the agenda, we
force the conversation to change.
Hopefully, both parties have learned
that you don't have to pander to us, but
you do have to listen to us because we
are not going away.
America has changed, and ifhistory
is any indication that is a very good
thing.
Let's just hope we embrace the
change in the spirit of cooperation and
not segregation.

Happy days, even with the cliff
La Di Dab Di Dab ...
We have been through a lot, people.
• But now the presidential race is settled
Barack Obama won. People on both
sides worked heroically, and, on
Thesday, their candidates behaved well.
This should be a happy time.
Ob, my God! There's a fiscal cliffl
We're all going to fall over and go
bankrupt!
Did you just hear the cheerful rule?
The fiscal cliff doesn't happen until the
end of the year when the Bush tax cuts
expire and monster budget cuts automatically
kick in. Now that the election's
over, everybody will certainly be
ready to move forward and WOlX something
out.
Except possibly Gov. Rick Perry,
who celebrated the president's re-election
by demanding the repeal of
Obamacare.
And then there was Donald Trump,
who tweeted during the vote count:
"Lets fight like hell and stop this great
and disgusting injustice! The world is
laughing at us."
Actually Trump has no conceivable
impact on anything. I just wanted to
take this opportunity to reminisce about
the time he sent me an irate, handwritten
message in which he misspelled the
word "too."
But look at Rep. John Boehner. On
• Wednesday, the House speaker gave a
speech in which he vowed to be cooperative.
"Mister President, this is your
moment. We're ready. to be led," he
said.
Except for a few no-go areas, such
as any tax increases on "small business."
You may remember from previous
erises that the House Republicans
oppose raising income taxes on the
wealthy because it would impact struggling
small businesses such as a hedge

annual income.
Boehner also raised a whole new
specter of political peril: "going over
part of the fiscal cliff." That sounded
less dire, as long as we all slay inside
our dangling cars and refrain from
making any moves until help arrives.
But, by the end, it sounded as if the
only cliff-avoidance Boehner was really
interested in was one that raised new
revenue through "fewer loopholes, and
lower rates for all."
We have already seen that plan. It
was proposed by a man who, on
Tuesday, lost the state in which he was
born, the slate in which he was governor
and the three slates in which he
owns houses. Thanks to a blog by Eric
Ostermeier in Smart Politics, I am able
to point out that the only candidate for
president who lost his home state by a
larger margin than Mitt Romney was
John Fremont in 1856. And Fremont
was coming out of a campaign in
which the opposition accused him of
being a cannibal.
While Boehner was explaining the
importance of not going halfway over
a cliff, or raising income taxes on the
ricb, he looked somber and somewhat
unhappy. This may have been because
his Republican colleagues just lost the
White House and the Senate. Or perhaps,
it was simply because he's an
. older white guy, and, therefore, part of
the biggest loser demographic of the
election, the flip-side of the insurgent
Latino vote.
On election nigh� people were talking
about the not-young male population
as if they were a dwiodling tribe of
graybeards sitting around a sputtering
stove in Oklaboma Republican _
gist John Weaver worried about
beconting "a shrinking regional party
of ntiddle-aged and older white men."
On Fox News, Bill O'Reilly moaned
that "the white establishment is now
the minority."
O'Reilly, 63, added that the new
majority was composed of people
who "want stuff." As opposed to
older white men, all of whom have
signed a pledge Dever to accept veteran
benefits, Social Security or
Medicare.
"It's not a traditional America anymore,"
O'Reilly sadly concluded
Almost everybody thinks of the
world of their youth as the traditional
world. In the future, today's teenagers
will he looking back and mournfully
declaring that traditional America was
a place where folks really knew how to
Twitter. Still, it's unseemly to identify
the true America as the one where your
group ran everything.
Cheer up, white men! You seem to
be doing OK. Next year women will
have 20 percent of the seats in the U.s.
Senate, and we're celebrating.
And since it looks as if we're not
getting any downtime, we'll have to
get cracking on this latest congressional
crisis. Root for a bipartisan solution
that does not involve the White House's
being hijacked by a guy who keeps
babbling about going halfway over a
cliff
In the past, when these things came
up, the president's big failing was his
inability to hide his contempt for many
of the people who occupy Capitol Hill.
Now it's a new day, and he needs to be
so perpetually and visibly avaiJahle that
the negotiator.; beg to be left alone.
If all else fails, strap John Boehner
to the roof of a car.·

Can Republi·cans adapt?
This was one that the Republicans
really should have won.
Given the weak economy,American
voters were open to firing President
Barack Obama. In Europe, in similar
circumstances, onc government after
another lost re-election. And, at the
begimting of this year, it looked as if
the Republicans ntight win control of
the U.S. Senate as well.
Yet it wasn't the Democrats who
won so much as the Republicans who
lost - at a most basic level, because
of demography. A coalition of aging
white men is a recipe for failure in a
nation that increasingly looks like a
rainbow.
Schadenfreude may excuse
Democrats' smiles for a few days, but
these trends portend a potential disas
ter not just for the Republican Party
but for the health of our political system.
America needs a plausible center-right
opposition party to hold
Obama's feet to the ftre, not just a
collection of Tea Party cranks.
So liberals as well as conservatives
should be rooting for the Republican
Party to feel sufficiendy shaken that it
shifts to the center. One hopeful sign is
that political parties usually care more
about winning than about purism.
Thus the Democratic Party embraced
the pragmatic center-left Bill Clinton
in 1992 after three consecutive . losses
in presidential elections.
That was painful for many liberals,
who cringed when Clinton interrupted
campaigning in the 1992 primary
to·burnish his law-and-order credentials
by overseeing the execution of a
mentally impaired murderer. But it
was, on balance, less painful than los
ing again.
You would expect the Republican
Party to make a similar lurch to the
center. But many Republican leaders
still inhabit a bubble. It was stunning
how many, from Karl Rove to Newt
Gingrich, seemed to expect a Mitt
Romney victory. And some of the
right-wing postmortems are suggesting
that Romney lost because he was
too libetal-which constitutes a defirtition
of delusional.
Imagine what would have happened
if the Republican nominee had
been Gingrich or Rick Santorum. We
surely would have seen a Democratic
landslide.
On the other hand, if the
Republicans had nominated Jon
Huntsman Jr., they ntight have been
the ones celebrating right now. But he
had no chance in Republican prima:
ries because primary voters are their
party's worst enemy.
Part of the problem, I think, is the
profusion of right-wing radio and
television programs. Democrats complain
furiously that Rush Limbaugh,
Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity smear
the left, but I wonder if the bigger
loser isn't the Republican Party itself
Those shows whip up a frenzy in
their audience, torpedoing Republican
moderates and instilling paranoia on

St. Thomas-St. John Private Schools Arawaks senior Omar Henderson tackles senior teammate Patrick Leonard
during Thursday's practice at Antilles School.
ST. THOMAS - Luke Neely
might not know where to begin if he
were in an opposing coach's position
and had to gameplan against his
St. Thomas-St. Jobo Private Schools
Arawaks. The variety of fonnations
running through his no-huadle
offense can be a headache for
defenses.
"It's difficult," Neely said. "We're
a multi-formation, multi-game
offense. We run a power game, a gap
. scheme to zone scheme. It's a lot to
prepare for. Teams could potentially
stop us."
Ivanna Eudora Kean High School
(1-3) hopes to turn that potential into
reality when the two teams meet at 7
tonight in an IAA tackle football
. game at Lionel Roberts Stadiwn,
The Arawaks (2·1) crushed the
Devil Rays, 44-0, in the season opener,
which ended early in the fourth
quarter because of the league's mercy
rule.
"We hope that the defense, by now,
has learned the schemes," Kean High
coach Elroy Donovan Jr. said. "It was
the first game of the season and we
have a lot of young guys."
Donova"n is eager to see if his
defense learned from the tough les·
sons 'handed out by the Arawaks'
senior tailback tandem of Chris
Cilliers and David McDonald.
Cilliers pounded his way to two
rushing toucbdowns and a receiving
touchdown, and McDonald led the
team with 75 rushing yards on seven
carries. At 210 pounds, Cilliers can
easily shed routine tackles .
"He's a big, strong guy," Donovan
said. "Our guys have to realize that
you have to adjust for that type of
running back. We can't expect to
wrap him up high and take him
down."
At 170 pounds, McDonald offers a
!/",edy change of pace. But he won't
sby away from contact.
"They're tough guys to bring
down," Neely said. "They're bruisers
and it's gonna take two or three
guys" to bring them down at any
time."
Arawaks dropped a 22-8 game

ST. THOMAS.-There is no question who
the vocal leader is on the Ivanna Eudora Kean

ChanteU Grant can he heard loud and.clear after
nearly every point.
VARS ITY VOLLEYBALL
After dfopping the first game by II points
against Ss. Peter and Paul on Thursday at Keav
High, Grant and the Lady Rays began communicating.
The result was a loose, .energetic and
more confident team through the next three
games as Kean High won the match, 4-1 (14-
25, 26-24, 25-16,25-18).
"I got to cheer them up," Grant said. "That's
that motivation. My team's gonna back.me up
too, you know."
Grant backed up her talk and recorded two
consecutive aces in the final game to push the
lead to 17·9. She was also involved in a signalure
point of the match when three Kean High
players on three different hits had to lunge and
punch at the ball with one hand to keep the volley
alive.
The Lady Jaguars were stunned when Kean
sophomore Akia Frett finished that point by hitting
