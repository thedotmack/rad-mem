30 Ordinary Photos With Amazing Backstories  
Posted: 07 Mar 2019 05:15 AM PST 
Sometimes certain pictures have unique significant meanings to us even though others would see them as a simple 
snapshot. That old faded picture of you sitting on the beach? Maybe it was the first time you ever saw the sea. A 2o-year-
old picture with a childhood friend at their birthday party? Maybe it's the last picture of you together before you drifted 
apart. Bored Panda has compiled a list of photos that look ordinary at first glance but become something special once you 
hear the stories behind them. Check them out in the gallery below!

#1 Tadeusz Zytkiewicz Holding A Picture Of Himself 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020666 
This is Tadeusz Zytkiewicz — the first person in Poland to receive a heart transplant — holding a picture of himself and the 
performing doctor, Zbigniew Religa, with his colleague, seen sleeping in the corner. The difficult surgery took 23 hours 
and Dr. Religa stayed up to monitor the patient's vitals. The photo, taken by American photographer James Stanfield, 
was chosen to by National Geographic to be the best picture of 1987. 
#2 The Three Unsung Heroes Of Chernobyl 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020667 
The three men — Alexei Ananenko (second left) and soldiers Valeri Bezpalov (center) and Boris Baranov (far right) — 
risked their lives o drain the fluid near the reactor during the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1986. 
After the plant's water-cooling system failed and a pool formed under the reactor to days into the disaster, there was a 
high risk that the lava-like radioactive substance could melt through the barriers and drop the reactor's core into said 
pool, causing a steam explosion. Luckily, the men were able to drain the fluid and spectacularly, all three survived. 
#3 Cher Arni 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020668 
Cher Ami was the name given to a pigeon that saved 200 soldiers during WWI. The poor bird was shot multiple times 
and lost an eye and a leg but still managed to deliver a message from the trapped battalion. 
#4 'Behind Closed Doors' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020669 
Photographer Donna Ferrato took this gruesome picture back in 1982 when photographing the lives of wealthy swingers. 
The couple — Elisabeth and Bengt — were having an argument and it quickly escalated, resulting in Bengt hitting his 
partner. The photographer wanted the photo to be published but many publishers refused and she only managed to do so 
in 1991. The book was titled 'Living With the Enemy' and chronicled events of domestic violence. Thanks to Donna's 
efforts, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. 
#5 Behind The Counter 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020670 
The photo, taken by Fred Blackwell on May 28, 1963, shows three protesters — John Salter, Joan Trumpauer and Anne 
Moody — sitting at the counter of a white-only Woolworth's five-and-dime store in Jackson while an angry mob pours 
ketchup, sugar, and mustard on them. The three protesters were from the Tougaloo College, a black college that went on 
to become the core of the civil rights movement in Mississippi. 
#6 'Wait For Me, Daddy' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020671 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020672 
This moving photo was captured by Claude Detloff in Vancouver during WWII as soldiers of the Duke of Connaught's 
Own Rifles were marching off to fight. The boy's father safely returned home in October 1945. 
#7 Childhood Friends 
On April 6, 1972, workers of French company Joint Francais went on strike and were confronted by the riot police. This 
picture, captured by Jacques Gourmelen, shows two men — Guy Burmieux, a worker at the company, and Jean-Yvon 
Antignac, a riot policeman — standing face to face. In that moment, the two recognized eachother — they were childhood 
friends. "I saw him [Guy Burmieux] go toward his friend and grab him by the collar. He wept with rage and told him, 'Go 
ahead and hit me while you're at it!' The other one didn't move a muscle," recalled the photographer. 
#8 'Burst Of Joy' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020673 
This photo, taken in 1973 and titled 'Burst of Joy', shows United States Air Force Lt Col Robert L. Stirm reuniting with his 
family after spending over 5 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. The girl with the open arms is Robert's 15-year-
old daughter Lorrie. The photo was taken by Associated Press photographer Slava "Sal" Veder and won a Pulitzer 
prize. "You could feel the energy and the raw emotion in the air," recalled the photographer. 
#9 The Youngest Mother 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020674 
Lina Medina, born on 23 September, 1933, was the youngest woman ever to give birth. She did so when she was just 5-
years-old. Turns out Lina was born with a rare condition called 'precocious puberty', a condition where sexual 
development happens at an early age. Lina gave birth on May 14, 1939, via a cesarean section, since her pelvis was too 
small. The child, named Gerardo, was born completely healthy but the father was never found out. 
#10 `Terezka's Scrawls' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020675 
The photo, taken by photographer David Seymour in 1948, shows Terezka, a young girl living in the home for emotionally 
disturbed children located in Warsaw, 1948. The girl grew up in a concentration camp and the past horrors can still be 
seen on her face. 
#11 Two Brothers 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020676 
What might look like a fun photo at first glance, showing two brothers, Michael and Sean McQuilken, is actually the last 
picture of them before being struck by lightning. The photo was taken at Moro Rock in California's Sequoia National Park 
on August 20, 1975. "At the time, we thought this was humorous. I took a photo of Mary (their sister) and Mary took a 
photo of Sean and me. I raised my right hand into the air and the ring I had on began to buzz so loudly that everyone 
could hear it. I found myself on the ground with the others. Sean was collapsed and huddled on his knees. Smoke was 
pouring from his back," recalled Michael. All of them survived but, sadly, Sean took his own life in 1989. 
#12 Moving An Apartment Building To Create A 
Boulevard In Alba Iulia, Romania 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020677 
This amazing photo, taken in Alba Iulia, Romania back in 1987, shows construction workers moving a whole house after 
it was deemed to be in the way of a new boulevard. The building was split into two parts and moved 55 meters to the side. 
The workers moved the 7,600-ton building in just six hours. 
#13 Motel Manager Pouring Acid In The Water 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020678 
The photograph, taken by Horace Cort, shows Jimmy Brock, manager of the Monson Motor Lodge motel pouring a bottle 
of muriatic acid into the pool to scare protesters swimming in the pool. Martin Luther King Jr was arrested for 
trespassing at the same motel seven days prior and the protesters planned a swim-in in the motel's pool. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020679 
#14 Children For Sale 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020680 
Image source: Rare Historical Photos  
This photo, taken in 1948, shows Lucille Chalifoux, a 24-year-old woman auctioning off her children after her husband 
lost his job and the family was forced to move from their apartment. Lucille was pregnant with her fifth child at the time. 
All of the children were bought off and rumors say they were forced into slavery. 
#15 'Tragedy By The Sea' 
Photographer John Gaunt was in the front yard of his beach home when he heard his neighbor shouting "something's 
happening on the beach!". The photographer quickly grabbed his camera and rushed to the beach where he found a 
couple by the water clutching each other. Their 19-month-old son had just wandered off and vanished into the water. This 
heartbreaking photo went on to wn the Pulitzer Prize. 
#16 'An Armenian Man Dances For His Lost Son In The 
Mountains Near Aparan, Armenia' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020681 
"In 1998, I found myself in Aparan, a large town an hour's drive from Armenia's capital, Yerevan. A local dance troupe 
was performing that evening, in the open air, with most of the suburb in attendance. As soon as I took my first shot, an 
old man approached me," said French photographer Antoine Agoudjian. "Tears streamed down his face. He told me that 
his son had died. That he had been electrocuted, that he was his pride and joy, and that I looked just like him. He broke 
into sobs and moved towards me with outstretched arms. His name was Ishran. I asked if he would dance for me, and he 
began dancing. The troupe paused and perched on an outcrop of rocks in the background. It was beautiful, not because 
the man is beautiful, but because he represents something deep inside the collective consciousness of the Armenian 
community: a celebratory resilience in the face of overwhelming loss." 
#17 Class Of 1999 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020682 
What looks like an innocent high school picture, actually hides a dark secret — the teens on the left, pretending to point 
guns at the camera, were Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the same people that organized and carried out the Columbine 
shooting. 
4618 Atomic Bomb Detonation 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020683 
Image source: Reddit  
Harold Edgerton was an MIT physicist, photographer, and pioneer of strobe light photography — a type of photography 
that allowed to capture incredibly fast moving things clearly. This photograph was taken at the Nevada ProvingGrounds 
by Edgerton on June 5, 1952, during the operation Operation Tumbler-Snapper test series. 
#19 'flight Of Refugees Across Wrecked Bridge In Korea' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020684 
Back in 1950, Associatede Press photographer Max Desfor took this dramatic photograph of refugees trying to cross a 
destroyed Pyongyang bridge, over the Taedong River in North Korea to escape the country. The photo won the Pulitzer 
Prize in 1951. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020685 
#20 "I Will Not Be Sued! I Have The Voice Of An Angel! 
No Man Can Sue Me." 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020686 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020687 
After giving an amazing performance in Chicago's Civic Opera House back on November 17, 1955, opera singer Maria 
Callas was served a court summons by U.S. Marshal Stanley Pringle and Deputy Sheriff Dan Smith for breach of contract. 
Upon being presented with the document, Maria screamed "I will not be sued! I have the voice of an angel! No man can 
sue me." The singer was nicknamed "The Tigress" and vowed never to return to Chicago again. 
#21 Young Osama 
In this family picture taken in Sweden in 1971, the man second from the left seen in a brown shirt is no one else but 
Osama bin Laden. 
#22 Rajiv Gandhi 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020688 
Just moments after this picture was taken, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed by the girl seen on the bottom 
left wearing orange flowers — she was wearing a suicide west. 
#23 SS Gran dcamp 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020689 
What might seem like an ordinary picture at first, shows a fire breaking out aboard the ship called SS Grandcamp. The 
people on the dock are members of the Texas City Volunteer Fire Department, attempting to extinguish the fire. Just 
moments after the picture was taken, the ship exploded and caused what is still known as the largest non-nuclear 
explosion in human history. Over 5,000 people were injured and 468 died in this 1947 tragedy. 
#24 Soviet Soldiers Harassing A German Woman 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020690 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020691 
During the Soviet occupation of Germany, mass rapes took place in the occupied territory during the war and after. Some 
historians say that as many as 2 million German women might have been raped. 
#25 'Leap Into Freedom' 
Image source: TIME 
After post-war Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, the living conditions were greatly different in each one. 
Between 1949 and 1961, about 2.5 million people fled from Soviet-occupied East Germany. Barricades and barb wire was 
placed to stop people from fleeing but that did not stop 19-year-old border guard Hans Conrad Schumann. A crown in 
West Berlin was enticing the young soldier to come over. The soldier said he did not want to "live enclosed," and jumped 
the barbed wire, escaping into the West side. The photo was considered a symbol of freedom but Hans did not deal with 
the newly-found fame well — he committed suicide in 1998. 
#26 'D-Day' 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020692 
Image source: TIME 
LIFE photographer Robert Capa captured this dramatic image on 6 June, 1944 — during the D-Day invasion. The man in 
the photo is Private First Class Huston Riley, a 22-year-old soldier who was shot multiple times. The photographer and a 
fellow sergeant helped the wounded soldier who later recalled thinking "What the hell is this guy doing here? I can't 
believe it. Here's a cameraman on the shore." Robert spent over an hour taking photographs as men around him died. 
Sadly, only one roll of the film survived but the grainy photos were enough to portray the gut-wrenching atmosphere of 
that day. 
#27 An Injured Young Mill Worker 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020693 
This photo, captured in October 1912, shows an 11-year-old Sanders Spinning Mill worker Giles Edmund Newsom, who 
recently lost two fingers after an accident in the workplace. He was working along his younger brother for a few months 
before the accident. 
*28 Rodney Alcala 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020694 
In this picture, Rodney Alcala, known as the 'dating game killer', cross-examines himself in court. He killed several 
women in the 705 and was even a guest on a dating show during that period. He tried representing himself in court, 
changing his voice and pretending to be a different person, but eventually lost and was sentenced to death. 
*29 "The Last Laugh?" 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020695 
Two convicted murderers — Richard Hickock and Perry Smith — laugh after hearing about their death sentences. They 
have murdered a family of four after trying to rob them and only finding $50. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020696 
#3o Argument 
This dramatic photo was taken by French-Iranian photographer Abbas in Tehran, Iran back in 1978. A rioter holds the 
shoes of a dead friend who was killed after the military opened fire on the crowd, while the soldier tries to convince the 
man it was not his unit that opened fire.

lately we have people from all over the world being our becoming our biggest fans and observing cultural and other 
similarities between Slavic and their cultures," said the Facebook page.
