Dear Mr. Lefkowitz, 
Martin Weinberg 
Here are the questions I'd like to ask Jeffrey Epstein. Would he be available to answer any of these on 
the phone or by email? People have told me some of his thoughts on background but I wanted to see if he 
could tell me or email me anything directly I could use on the record. Also I'd like to run the 
information I already have by you or him. 
Thank you, 
Alexandra 
-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation? 
Could he talk about his interest in science and the 2011 grants/conference? 
-How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the 
same clients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion? 
-Did he still work while in prison? How was that arranged? With whom was he working/advising? 
-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social life changed from three years ago? 
-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? 
-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions to his conviction? 
-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it too lenient or too harsh and why? 
-What is his side of the story and have people been supportive? 
-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started with Bill Clinton, etc?
