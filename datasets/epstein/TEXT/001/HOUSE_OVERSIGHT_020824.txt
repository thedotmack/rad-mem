This report looks at the federal government as if it were a business, with the goal of informing the
debate about our nation’s financial situation and outlook. In it, we examine USA Inc.’s income
statement and balance sheet. We aim to interpret the underlying data and facts and illustrate
patterns and trends in easy-to-understand ways. We analyze the drivers of federal revenue and
the history of expense growth, and we examine basic scenarios for how America might move
toward positive cash flow.
Thanks go out to Liang Wu and Fred Miller and former Morgan Stanley colleagues whose
contributions to this report were invaluable. In addition, Richard Ravitch, Emil Henry, Laura
Tyson, Al Gore, Meg Whitman, John Cogan, Peter Orszag and Chris Liddell provided inspiration
and insights as the report developed. It includes a 2-page foreword; a 12-page text summary;
and 460 PowerPoint slides containing data-rich observations. There’s a lot of material – think of
it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.
We hope the slides in particular provide relevant context for the debate about America’s
financials. To kick-start the dialogue, we are making the entire slide portion of the report
available as a single work for non-commercial distribution (but not for excerpting, or modifying or
creating derivatives) under the Creative Commons license. The spirit of connectivity and sharing
has become the essence of the Internet, and we encourage interested parties to use the slides to
advance the discussion of America’s financial present and future. If you would like to add your
own data-driven observations, contribute your insights, improve or clarify ours, please contact us
to request permission and provide your suggestions. This document is only a starting point for
discussion; the information in it will benefit greatly from your thoughtful input.

Foreword
George P. Shultz, Paul Volcker, Michael Bloomberg, Richard Ravitch and John Doerr
February 2011
Our country is in deep financial trouble. Federal, state and local governments are deep in debt
yet continue to spend beyond their means, seemingly unable to stop. Our current path is simply
unsustainable. What to do?
A lot of people have offered suggestions and proposed solutions. Few follow the four key
guideposts to success that we see for setting our country back on the right path:
1) create a deep and widely held perception of the reality of the problem and the stakes involved;
2) reassure citizens that there are practical solutions;
3) develop support in key constituencies; and
4) determine the right timing to deliver the solutions.
USA Inc. uses each of these guideposts, and more; it is full of ideas that can help us build a
better future for our children and our country.
First, Mary Meeker and her co-contributors describe America’s problems in an imaginative way
that should allow anyone to grasp them both intellectually and emotionally. By imagining the
federal government as a company, they provide a simple framework for understanding our
current situation. They show how deficits are piling up on our income statement as spending
outstrips income and how our liabilities far exceed nominal assets on our balance sheet. USA
Inc. also considers additional assets – hard to value physical assets and our intangible wealth –
our creativity and energy and our tradition of an open, competitive society.
Additionally, the report considers important trends, pointing specifically to an intolerable failure to
educate many in the K-12 grades, despite our knowledge of how to do so. And all these
important emotional arguments help drive a gut reaction to add to data provided to reinforce the
intellectual reasons we already have.
Second, USA Inc. provides a productive way to think about solving our challenges. Once we
have created an emotional and intellectual connection to the problem, we want people to act and
drive the solution, not to throw up their hands in frustration. The authors’ ingenious indirect
approach is to ask what a turnaround expert would do and what questions he or she would ask.
The report describes how we first stumbled into this mess, by failing to predict the magnitude of
program costs, by creating perverse incentives for excessive behavior, and by missing important
trends. By pointing to the impact of individual responsibility, USA Inc. gives us reason to believe
that a practical solution exists and can be realized.

Third, the report highlights how powerful bipartisan constituencies have emerged in the past to
tackle great issues for the betterment of our nation, including tax reform, civil liberties,
healthcare, education and national defense. Just as presidents of both parties rose to the
occasion to preside over the difficult process of containment during the half-century cold war, we
know we can still find leaders who are willing to step up and overcome political or philosophical
differences for a good cause, even in these difficult times.
Finally, the report makes an important contribution to the question of timing. Momentum will
follow once the process begins to gain support, and USA Inc. should help by stimulating broad
recognition and understanding of the challenges, by providing ways to think about solutions, and
by helping constituencies of action to emerge. As the old saying goes, “If not now, when? If not
us, who?”
With this pioneering report, we have a refreshing, business-minded approach to understanding
and addressing our nation’s future. Read on…you may be surprised by how much you learn. We
hope you will be motivated to help solve the problem!

Summary
Imagine for a moment that the United States government is a public corporation. Imagine
that its management structure, fiscal performance, and budget are all up for review. Now
imagine that you’re a shareholder in USA Inc. How do you feel about your investment?
Because 45% of us own shares in publicly traded companies, nearly half the country expects
quarterly updates on our investments. But although 100% of us are stakeholders in the United
States, very few of us look closely at Washington’s financials. If we were long-term investors,
how would we evaluate the federal government’s business model, strategic plans, and operating
efficiency? How would we react to its earnings reports? Nearly two-thirds of all American
households pay federal income taxes, but very few of us take the time to dig into the numbers of
the entity that, on average, collects 13% of our annual gross income (not counting another 15-
30% for payroll and various state and local taxes).
We believe it’s especially important to pay closer attention to one of our most important
investments.
As American citizens and taxpayers, we care about the future of our country. As investors, we’re
in an on-going search for data and insights that will help us make more informed investment
decisions. It’s easier to predict the future if one has a keen understanding of the past, but we
found ourselves struggling to find good information about America’s financials. So we decided to
assemble – in one place and in a user-friendly format – some of the best data about the world’s
biggest “business.” We also provide some historical context for how USA Inc.’s financial model
has evolved over decades. And, as investors, we look at trend lines which help us understand
the patterns (and often future directions) of key financial drivers like revenue and expenses.
The complexity of USA Inc.’s challenges is well known, and our presentation is just a starting
point; it’s far from perfect or complete. But we are convinced that citizens – and investors –
should understand the business of their government. Thomas Jefferson and Alexis de
Tocqueville knew that – armed with the right information – the enlightened citizenry of America
would make the right decisions. It is our humble hope that a transparent financial framework can
help inform future debates.
In the conviction that every citizen should understand the finances of USA Inc. and the plans of
its “management team,” we examine USA Inc.’s income statement and balance sheet and
present them in a basic, easy-to-use format. We summarize our thoughts in PowerPoint form and
in this brief text summary at www.kpcb.com/usainc. We encourage people to take our data and
thoughts and study them, critique them, augment them, share them, and make them better.
There’s a lot of material – think of it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.

There are two caveats. First, we do not make policy recommendations. We try to help clarify
some of the issues in a straightforward, analytical way. We aim to present data, trends, and facts
about USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for how its financials have
reached their present state. Our observations come from publicly available information, and we
use the tools of basic financial analysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party
agencies like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan federal agency charged
with reviewing the financial impact of legislation. Second, the ‘devil is in the details.’ For US
policy makers, the timing of material changes will be especially difficult, given the current
economic environment.
By the standards of any public corporation, USA Inc.’s financials are discouraging.
True, USA Inc. has many fundamental strengths. On an operating basis (excluding Medicare
and Medicaid spending and one-time charges), the federal government’s profit & loss statement
is solid, with a 4% median net margin over the last 15 years. But cash flow is deep in the red (by
almost $1.3 trillion last year, or -$11,000 per household), and USA Inc.’s net worth is negative
and deteriorating. That net worth figure includes the present value of unfunded entitlement
liabilities but not hard-to-value assets such as natural resources, the power to tax or mint
currency, or what Treasury calls “heritage” or “stewardship assets” like national parks.
Nevertheless, the trends are clear, and critical warning signs are evident in nearly every data
point we examine.

Underfunded entitlements are among the most severe financial burdens USA Inc. faces.
And because some of the most underfunded programs are intended to help the nation’s
poorest, the electorate must understand the full dimensions of the challenges.

Note: Medicaid funding is appropriated by Congress (from general tax revenue) on an as-needed basis every year, therefore,
there is no need to maintain a contingency reserve, and, unlike Medicare, the “financial status” of the program is not in question
from an actuarial perspective. Here we estimated the net present value of future Medicaid spending through 2085E, assuming a
3% discount rate. Data source: Dept. of Treasury, Dept. of Health & Human Services Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
USA Inc. | Summary
Some consider defense outlays – which have nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP –
a principal cause of USA Inc.’s financial dilemma. But defense spending is still below its 7%
share of GDP from 1948 to 2000; it accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, compared with
41% of all government spending between 1789 and 1930. The principal challenges lie
elsewhere. Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with
the best of intentions, created various entitlement programs. They serve many of the nation’s
poorest, whose struggles have been made worse by the recent financial crisis. Apart from Social
Security and unemployment insurance, however, funding for these programs has been woefully
inadequate – and getting worse.
Entitlement expenses amount to $16,000 per household per year, and entitlement spending far
outstrips funding, by more than $1 trillion (or $9,000 per household) in 2010. More than 35% of
the US population receives entitlement dollars or is on the government payroll, up from ~20% in
1966. Given the high correlation of rising entitlement income with declining savings, do
Americans feel less compelled to save if they depend on the government for their future savings?
It is interesting to note that in China the household savings rate is ~36%, per our estimates
based on CEIC data, in part due to a higher degree of self-reliance – and far fewer established
pension plans. In the USA, the personal savings rate (defined as savings as percent of
disposable income) was 6% in 2010 and only 3% from 2000 to 2008.

Millions of Americans have come to rely on Medicare and Medicaid – and spending has
skyrocketed, to 21% of USA Inc.’s total expenses (or $724B) in F2010, up from 5% forty
years ago.
Together, Medicaid and Medicare – the programs providing health insurance to low-income
households and the elderly, respectively – now account for 35% of total healthcare spending in
the USA. Since their creation in 1965, both programs have expanded markedly. Medicaid now
serves 16% of all Americans, compared with 2% at its inception; Medicare now serves 15% of
the population, up from 10% in 1966. As more Americans receive benefits and as healthcare
costs continue to outstrip GDP growth, total spending for the two entitlement programs is
accelerating. Over the last decade alone, Medicaid spending has doubled in real terms, with
total program costs running at $273 billion in F2010. Over the last 43 years, real Medicare
spending per beneficiary has risen 25 times, driving program costs well (10x) above original
projections. In fact, Medicare spending exceeded related revenues by $272 billion last year.
Amid the rancor about government’s role in healthcare spending, one fact is undeniable:
government spending on healthcare now consumes 8.2% of GDP, compared with just
1.3% fifty years ago.

USA Inc. | Summary
The overall healthcare funding mix in the US is skewed toward private health insurance due to
the predominance of employer-sponsored funding (which covers 157MM working Americans and
their families, or 58% of the total population in 2008 vs. 64% in 1999). This mixed private-public
funding scheme has resulted in implicit cross-subsidies, whereby healthcare providers push
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc.
x
costs onto the private market to help subsidize lower payments from public programs. This
tends to help drive a cycle of higher private market costs causing higher insurance premiums,
leading to the slow erosion of private market coverage and a greater enrollment burden for
government programs.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in early 2010, includes the biggest
changes to healthcare since 1965 and will eventually expand health insurance coverage by
~10%, to 32 million new lives. Increased access likely means higher spending if healthcare
costs continue to grow 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have over the
past 40 years). The CBO sees a potential $143B reduction in the deficit over the next 10 years,
but this assumes that growth in Medicare costs will slow – an assumption the CBO admits is
highly uncertain.
Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. Their
future, unfortunately, isn’t so clear.
Unemployment Insurance is cyclical and, apart from the 2007-09 recession, generally operates
with a surplus. Payroll taxes kept Social Security mainly at break-even until 1975-81 when
expenses began to exceed revenue. Reforms that cut average benefits by 5%, raised tax rates
by 2.3%, and increased the full retirement age by 3% (to 67) restored the system’s stability for
the next 25 years, but the demographic outlook is poor for its pay-as-you-go funding structure. In
1950, 100 workers supported six beneficiaries; today, 100 workers support 33 beneficiaries.
Since Social Security began in 1935, American life expectancy has risen 26% (to 78), but the
“retirement age” for full benefits has increased only 3%.
Regardless of the emotional debate about entitlements, fiscal reality can’t be ignored – if
these programs aren’t reformed, one way or another, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go
from bad to worse.

USA Inc. | Summary
Take a step back, and imagine what the founding fathers would think if they saw how our
country’s finances have changed. From 1790 to 1930, government spending on average
accounted for just 3% of American GDP. Today, government spending absorbs closer to 24% of
GDP.
It’s likely that they would be even more surprised by the debt we have taken on to pay for this
expansion. As a percentage of GDP, the federal government’s public debt has doubled over the
last 30 years, to 53% of GDP. This figure does not include claims on future resources from
underfunded entitlements and potential liabilities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the
Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). If it did include these claims, gross federal debt
accounted for 94% of GDP in 2010. The public debt to GDP ratio is likely to triple to 146% over
the next 20 years, per CBO. The main reason is entitlement expense. Since 1970, these costs
have grown 5.5 times faster than GDP, while revenues have lagged, especially corporate tax
revenues. By 2037, cumulative deficits from Social Security could add another $11.6 trillion to
the public debt.
The problem gets worse. Even as USA Inc.’s debt has been rising for decades, plunging interest
rates have kept the cost of supporting it relatively steady. Last year’s interest bill would have
been 155% (or $290 billion) higher if rates had been at their 30-year average of 6% (vs. 2% in
2010). As debt levels rise and interest rates normalize, net interest payments could grow 20% or
more annually. Below-average debt maturities in recent years have also kept the Treasury’s
borrowing costs down, but this trend, too, will drive up interest payments once interest rates rise.

Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Data in our chart is based on CBO’s ‘alternative fiscal scenario’ forecast, which assumes a continuation of today’s underlying
fiscal policy. Note that CBO also maintains an ‘extended-baseline’ scenario, which adheres closely to current law. The alternative fiscal scenario deviates from
CBO’s baseline because it incorporates some policy changes that are widely expected to occur (such as extending the 2001-2003 tax cuts rather than letting them
expire as scheduled by current law and adjusting physician payment rates to be in line with the Medicare economic index rather than at lower scheduled rates) and
that policymakers have regularly made in the past.

USA Inc. | Summary
Less than 15 years from now, in other words, USA Inc. – based on current forecasts for revenue
and expenses - would have nothing left over to spend on defense, education, infrastructure, and
R&D, which today account for only 32% of USA Inc. spending, down from 69% forty years ago.
This critical juncture is getting ever closer. Just ten years ago, the CBO thought federal revenue
would support entitlement spending and interest payments until 2060 – 35 years beyond its
current projection. This dramatic forecast change over the past ten years helps illustrate, in our
view, how important it is to focus on the here-and-now trend lines and take actions based on
those trends.
How would a turnaround expert determine ‘normal’ revenue and expenses?
The first step would be to examine the main drivers of revenue and expenses. It’s not a pretty
picture. While revenue – mainly taxes on individual and corporate income – is highly correlated
(83%) with GDP growth, expenses – mostly entitlement spending – are less correlated (73%)
with GDP. With that as backdrop, our turnaround expert might try to help management and
shareholders (citizens) achieve a long-term balance by determining “normal” levels of revenue
and expenses:
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc.
xiii
• From 1965 to 2005 (a period chosen to exclude abnormal trends related to the recent
recession), annual revenue growth (3%) has been roughly in line with GDP growth, but
corporate income taxes have grown 2% a year. Social insurance taxes grew 5% annually and
represented 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965. An expert might ask:
o What level of social insurance or entitlement taxes can USA Inc. support without reducing
job creation?
o Are low corporate income taxes important to global competitive advantage and stimulating
growth?
• Entitlement spending has risen 5% a year on average since 1965, well above average annual
GDP growth of 3%, and now absorbs 51% of all expenses, more than twice its share in 1965.
Defense and non-defense discretionary spending (including infrastructure, education, and law
enforcement) is up just 1-2% annually over that period. Questions for shareholders:
o Do USA Inc.’s operations run at maximum efficiency? Where are the opportunities for cost
savings?
o Should all expense categories be benchmarked against GDP growth? Should some grow
faster or slower than GDP? If so, what are the key determinants?
o Would greater investment in infrastructure, education, and global competitiveness yield
more long-term security for the elderly and disadvantaged?
With expenses outstripping revenues by a large (and growing) margin, a turnaround expert
would develop an analytical framework for readjusting USA Inc.’s business model and strategic
plans. Prudence would dictate that our expert assume below-trend GDP growth and above-trend
unemployment, plus rising interest rates – all of which would make the base case operating
scenario fairly gloomy.
This analysis can’t ignore our dependence on entitlements. Almost one-third of all
Americans have grown up in an environment of lean savings and heavy reliance on
government healthcare subsidies. It’s not just a question of numbers – it’s a question of
our responsibilities as citizens…and what kind of society we want to be.
Some 90 million Americans (out of a total population of 307 million) have grown accustomed to
support from entitlement programs; so, too, have 14 million workers in the healthcare industry
who, directly or indirectly, benefit from government subsidies via Medicare and Medicaid. Low
personal savings and high unemployment make radical change difficult. Political will can be
difficult to summon, especially during election campaigns.
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc.
xiv
At the same time, however, these numbers don’t lie. With our demographics and our
debts, we’re on a collision course with the future. The good news: Although time is
growing short, we still have the capacity to create positive outcomes.
Even though USA Inc. can print money and raise taxes, USA Inc. cannot sustain its financial
imbalance indefinitely – especially as the Baby Boomer generation nears retirement age. Net
debt levels are approaching warning levels, and some polls suggest that Americans consider
reducing debt a national priority. Change is legally possible. Unlike underfunded pension
liabilities that can bankrupt companies, USA Inc.’s underfunded liabilities are not legal contracts.
Congress has the authority to change the level and conditions for Social Security and Medicare
benefits; the federal government, together with the states, can also alter eligibility and benefit
levels for Medicaid.
Options for entitlement reform, operating efficiency, and stronger long-term GDP growth.
As analysts, not public policy experts, we can offer mathematical illustrations as a framework for
discussion (not necessarily as actual solutions). We also present policy options from third-party
organizations such as the CBO.
Reforming entitlement programs – Social Security.
The underfunding could be addressed through some or all of the following mechanical changes:
increasing the full retirement age to as high as 73 (from the current level of 67); and/or reducing
average annual social security benefits by up to 12% (from $13,010 to $11,489); and/or
increasing the social security tax rate from 12.4% to 14.2%. Options proposed by the CBO
include similar measures, as well as adjustments to initial benefits and index levels. Of course,
the low personal savings rates of average Americans – 3% of disposable income, compared with
a 10% average from 1965 to 1985 – limit flexibility, at least in the early years of any reform.
Reforming entitlement programs – Medicare and Medicaid.
Mathematical illustrations for these programs, the most underfunded, seem draconian: Reducing
average Medicare benefits by 53%, to $5,588 per year, or increasing the Medicare tax rate by
3.9 percentage points, to 6.8%, or some combination of these changes would address the
underfunding of Medicare. As for Medicaid, the lack of a dedicated funding stream (i.e., a tax
similar to the Medicare payroll tax) makes the math even more difficult. But by one measure
from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 60% of the Medicaid budget in 2001 was spent on so-called
optional recipients (such as mid- to low-income population above poverty level) or on optional
services (such as dental services and prescription drug benefits). Reducing or controlling these
benefits could help control Medicaid spending – but increase the burden on some poor and
disabled groups.
Ultimately, the primary issue facing the US healthcare system is ever-rising costs, historically
driven by increases in price and utilization. Beneath sustained medical cost inflation is an
entitlement mentality bolted onto a volume-based reimbursement scheme. All else being equal,
the outcome is an incentive to spend: Underlying societal, financial, and liability factors combine
to fuel an inefficient, expensive healthcare system.

Improving operating efficiency.
With nearly one government civilian worker (federal, state and local) for every six households,
efficiency gains seem possible. A 20-year trend line of declining federal civilian headcount was
reversed in the late 1990s.
Resuming that trend would imply a 15% potential headcount reduction over five years and save
nearly $300 billion over the next ten years. USA Inc. could also focus intensively on local private
company outsourcing, where state and local governments are finding real productivity gains.
Improving long-term GDP growth – productivity and employment.
Fundamentally, federal revenues depend on GDP growth and related tax levies on consumers
and businesses. Higher GDP growth won’t be easy to achieve as households rebuild savings in
the aftermath of a recession. To break even without changing expense levels or tax policies,
USA Inc. would need real GDP growth of 6-7% in F2012-14 and 4-5% in F2015-20, according to
our estimates based on CBO data – highly unlikely, given 40-year average GDP growth of 3%.
While USA Inc. could temporarily increase government spending and investment to make up for
lower private demand in the near term, the country needs policies that foster productivity and
employment gains for sustainable long-term economic growth.

USA Inc. | Summary
Productivity gains and increased employment each contributed roughly half of the long-term
GDP growth between 1970 and 2009, per the National Bureau of Economic Research. Since the
1960s, as more resources have gone to entitlements and interest payments, USA Inc. has
scaled back its investment in technology R&D and infrastructure as percentages of GDP.
Competitors are making these investments. India plans to double infrastructure spending as a
percent of GDP by 2013, and its tertiary (college) educated population will double over the next
ten years, according to Morgan Stanley analysts, enabling its GDP growth to accelerate to 9-
10% annually by 2015 (China’s annual GDP growth is forecast to remain near 8% by 2015).
USA Inc. can’t match India’s demographic advantage, but technology can help.
www.kpcb.com

xvi
For employment gains, USA Inc. should minimize tax and regulatory uncertainties and
encourage businesses to add workers. While hiring and R&D-related tax credits may add to
near-term deficits, over time, they should drive job and GDP growth. Immigration reform could
also help: A Federal Reserve study in 2010 shows that immigration does not take jobs from
U.S.-born workers but boosts productivity and income per worker.
Changing tax policies.
Using another simple mechanical illustration, covering the 2010 budget deficit (excluding onetime
charges) by taxes alone would mean doubling individual income tax rates across the board,
to roughly 26-30% of gross income, we estimate. Such major tax increases would ultimately be
self-defeating if they reduce private income and consumption. However, reducing tax
expenditures and subsidies such as mortgage interest deductions would broaden the tax base
and net up to $1.7 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, per CBO. A tax based on
consumption - like a value added tax (VAT) - could also redirect the economy toward savings
and investment, though there would be drawbacks.
These issues are undoubtedly complex, and difficult decisions must be made. But
inaction may be the greatest risk of all. The time to act is now, and our first responsibility
as investors in USA Inc. is to understand the task at hand.
Our review finds serious challenges in USA Inc.’s financials. The ‘management team’ has
created incentives to spend on healthcare, housing, and current consumption. At the margin,
investing in productive capital, education, and technology – the very tools needed to compete in
the global marketplace – has stagnated.

With these trends, USA Inc. will not be immune to the sudden crises that have afflicted others
with similar unfunded liabilities, leverage, and productivity trends. The sovereign credit issues in
Europe suggest what might lie ahead for USA Inc. shareholders – and our children. In effect,
USA Inc. is maxing out its credit card. It has fallen into a pattern of spending more than it earns
and is issuing debt at nearly every turn. Common principles for overcoming this kind of burden
include the following:
1) Acknowledge the problem – some 80% of Americans believe ‘dealing with our growing
budget deficit and national debt’ is a national priority, according to a Peter G. Peterson
Foundation survey in 11/09;
2) Examine past errors – People need clear descriptions and analysis to understand how the
US arrived at its current financial condition – a ‘turnaround CEO’ would certainly initiate a
‘no holds barred’ analysis of the purpose, success and operating efficiency of all of USA
Inc.’s spending;
3) Make amends for past errors – Most Americans today at least acknowledge the problems
at personal levels and say they rarely or never spend more than what they can afford (63%
according to a 2007 Pew Research study). The average American knows the importance
of managing a budget. Perhaps more would be willing to sacrifice for the greater good with
an understandable plan to serve the country’s long-term best interests;
4) Develop a new code of behavior – Policymakers, businesses (including investment firms),
and citizens need to share responsibility for past failures and develop a plan for future
successes.
Past generations of Americans have responded to major challenges with collective
sacrifice and hard work. Will ours also rise to the occasion?

Presentation Premise
� For America to remain the great country it has been for the past 235 years,
it must determine the best ways to honor the government’s fundamental
mission derived from the Constitution:
� …to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,
provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
� To this end, government should aim to help create a vibrant environment for
economic growth and productive employment. It should manage its operations
and programs as effectively and efficiently as possible, improve its financial
position by driving the federal government’s income statement to long-term
break-even, and reduce the unsustainable level of debt on its balance sheet.

USA Inc. Concept
Healthy financials and compelling growth prospects are key to success for businesses
(and countries). So if the US federal government – which we call USA Inc. – were a
business, how would public shareholders view it? How would long-term investors evaluate
the federal government’s business model, strategic plans, and operating efficiency? How
would analysts react to its earnings reports? Although some 45% 1 of American households
own shares in publicly traded companies and receive related quarterly financial statements, not
many “stakeholders” look closely at Washington’s financials. Nearly two-thirds of all American
households 2 pay federal income taxes, but very few take the time to dig into the numbers of the
entity that, on average, collects 13% 3 of all Americans’ annual gross income (not counting
another 15-30% for payroll and various state and local taxes).
We drill down on USA Inc.’s past, present, and (in some cases) future financial dynamics and
focus on the country’s income statement and balance sheet and related trends. We isolate and
review key expense and revenue drivers. On the expense side, we examine the major
entitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) as well as defense and other
major discretionary programs. On the revenue side, we focus on GDP growth (driven by labor
productivity and employment in the long run) and tax policies.
We present basic numbers-driven scenarios for addressing USA Inc.'s financial challenges. In
addition, we lay out the type of basic checklists that corporate turnaround experts might use as
starting points when looking at some of USA Inc.’s business model challenges.

Why We Wrote This Report
As American citizens / tax payers, we care about the future of our country.
As investors, we search for data and insights to help us make better
investment decisions. (It’s easier to predict the future with a keen
understanding of the past.)
We found ourselves searching for better information about the state of America’s
financials, and we decided to assemble – in one place and in a user-friendly format
– some of the best data about the world’s biggest “business.” In addition, we have
attempted to provide some historical context for how USA Inc.’s financial model has
evolved over decades.
The complexity of USA Inc.’s challenges is well known, and our presentation is just
a starting point; it’s far from perfect or complete. But we are convinced that citizens
– and investors – should understand the business of their government. Thomas
Jefferson and Alexis de Tocqueville knew that – armed with the right information –
the enlightened citizenry of America would make the right decisions. It is our
humble hope that a transparent financial framework can help inform future debates.

What You’ll Find Here…
In the conviction that every citizen should understand the finances of
USA Inc. and the plans of its “management team,” we examine USA Inc.’s
income statement and balance sheet and present them in a basic, easy-touse
format.
In this document, a broad group of people helped us drill into our federal
government’s basic financial metrics. We summarize our thoughts in PowerPoint
form here and also have provided a brief text summary at www.kpcb.com/usainc.
We encourage people to take our data and thoughts and study them, critique them,
augment them, share them, and make them better. There’s a lot of material – think
of it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.

USA Inc. | Introduction
10
…And What You Won’t
We do not make policy recommendations. We try to help clarify some of the
issues in a simple, analytically-based way. We aim to present data, trends, and
facts about USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers to provide context for
how its financials have reached their present state.
We did not base this analysis on proprietary data. Our observations come
from publicly available information, and we use the tools of basic financial
analysis to interpret it. Forecasts generally come from 3rd-party agencies like the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO). For US policy makers, the timing of material
changes will be especially difficult, given the current economic environment.
No doubt, there will be compliments and criticism of things in the
presentation (or missing from it). We hope that this report helps advance the
discussion and we welcome others to opine with views (backed up by data).

We Focus on Federal,
Not State & Local Government Data
� Federal / State & Local Governments Share Different Responsibilities
� Federal government is financially responsible for all or the majority of Defense, Social
Security, Medicare and Interest Payments on federal debt and coordinates / shares
funding for public investment in education / infrastructure.
� State & local governments are financially responsible for all or the majority of Education,
Transportation (Road Construction & Maintenance), Public Safety (Police / Fire
Protection / Law Courts / Prisons) and Environment & Housing (Parks & Recreation /
Community Development / Sewerage & Waste Management).
� Federal / state & local governments share financial responsibility in Medicaid and
Unemployment Insurance.
� We Focus on the Federal Government
� State and local governments face many similar long-term financial challenges and may
ultimately require federal assistance. To be sure, the size of state & local government
budget deficits ($70 billion 1 in aggregate in F2009) and debt-to-GDP ratio (7% 2 on
average in F2008) pales by comparison to the federal government’s ($1.3 trillion budget
deficit, 62% debt-to-GDP ratio in F2010). But these metrics may understate state & local
governments’ financial challenges by 50% or more 3 because they exclude the long-term
cost of public pension and other post employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities.
www.kpcb.com
Note: 1) Per National Conference of State Legislatures, State fiscal years ends in June. $70B aggregate excludes deficits
from Puerto Rico ($3B deficits in F2009). 2) Debt-to-GDP ratio per Census Bureau State & Local Government Finance; 3)
Calculation based on the claim that $1T of collective short fall in State & local government pension and OPEB funding
would be $2.5T using corporate accounting rules, per Orin S. Kramer, “How to Cheat a Retirement Fund,” 9/10.

Highlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials
� Summary – USA Inc. has challenges.
� Cash Flow – While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative
for 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative
cash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,' many
of whom are people with few alternatives.
� Balance Sheet – Net worth is negative and deteriorating.
� Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities – Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily
unfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt
on the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits
(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA
Inc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance
sheet debt.
� Conclusion – Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by
shareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and
entrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,
but both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,
and sacrifice.

Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials…
� To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged
�
Excluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net
margin 1 over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or
-$11,000 per household), and net worth 2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).
� The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges
�
�
�
Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,
created various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have
been made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,
however, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate – and getting worse.
Entitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement
spending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by
more than $1 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges
only compound the problem.
Some consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.’s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and
streamlining could yield savings – $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study 3 – perhaps without
damaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although
defense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to
2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and
1930.

…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials…
� Medicare and Medicaid, largely underfunded (based on ‘dedicated’ revenue) and
growing rapidly, accounted for 21% (or $724B) of USA Inc.’s total expenses in F2010,
up from 5% forty years ago
� Together, these two programs represent 35% of all (annual) US healthcare spending; Federal Medicaid
spending has doubled in real terms over the last decade, to $273 billion annually.
� Total government healthcare spending consumes 8.2% of GDP compared with just
1.3% fifty years ago; the new health reform law could increase USA Inc.’s budget
deficit
� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs
continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).
� Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. The
future, not so bright
� Demographic trends have exacerbated the funding problems for Medicare and Social Security – of the
102 million increased enrollment between 1965 and 2009, 42 million (or 41%) is due to an aging
population. With a 26% longer life expectancy but a 3% increase in retirement age (since Social
Security was created in 1935), deficits from Social Security could add $11.6 trillion (or 140%) to the
public debt by 2037E, per Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials
� If entitlement programs are not reformed, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go from bad to
worse
� Public debt has doubled over the last 30 years, to 62% of GDP. This ratio is expected to surpass the
90% threshold* – above which real GDP growth could slow considerably – in 10 years and could near
150% of GDP in 20 years if entitlement expenses continue to soar, per CBO.
� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs
continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).
� The turning point: Within 15 years (by 2025), entitlements plus net interest expenses
will absorb all – yes, all – of USA Inc.’s annual revenue, per CBO
� That would require USA Inc. to borrow funds for defense, education, infrastructure, and R&D spending,
which today account for 32% of USA Inc. spending (excluding one-time items), down dramatically from
69% forty years ago.
� It’s notable that CBO’s projection from 10 years ago (in 1999) showed Federal revenue sufficient to
support entitlement spending + interest payments until 2060E – 35 years later than current projection.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the
relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP.
Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We note that while
Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European
countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.

How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?...
� Key focus areas would likely be reducing USA Inc.’s budget deficit and improving /
restructuring the ‘business model’…
� One would likely drill down on USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers, then develop a
basic analytical framework for ‘normal’ revenue / expenses, then compare options.

Annual growth in revenue of 3% has been roughly in line with GDP for 40 years* while
corporate income taxes grew at 2%. Social insurance taxes (for Social Security / Medicare)
grew 5% annually and now represent 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965.
Annual growth in expenses of 3% has been roughly in line with revenue, but entitlements are
up 5% per annum - and now absorb 51% of all USA Inc.’s expense - more than twice their
share in 1965; defense and other discretionary spending growth has been just 1-2%.
�
One might ask…
Should expense and revenue levels be re-thought and re-set so USA Inc. operates near
break-even and expense growth (with needed puts and takes) matches GDP growth, thus
adopting a ‘don’t spend more than you earn’ approach to managing USA Inc.’s financials?
Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent
40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969, so

many metrics (like individual income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.

…How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?
One might consider…
�
�
�
Options for reducing expenses by focusing on entitlement reform and operating efficiency
�
�
Formula changes could help Social Security’s underfunding, but look too draconian for Medicare/Medicaid;
the underlying healthcare cost dilemma requires business process restructuring and realigned incentives.
Resuming the 20-year trend line for lower Federal civilian employment, plus more flexible compensation
systems and selective local outsourcing, could help streamline USA Inc.’s operations.
Options for increasing revenue by focusing on driving long-term GDP growth and changing tax
policies
� USA Inc. should examine ways to invest in growth that provides a high return (ROI) via new investment in
technology, education, and infrastructure and could stimulate productivity gains and employment growth.
�
Reducing tax subsidies (like exemptions on mortgage interest payments or healthcare benefits) and
changing the tax system in other ways could increase USA Inc.’s revenue without raising income taxes to
punitive – and self-defeating – levels. Such tax policy changes could help re-balance USA’s economy
between consumption and savings and re-orient business lines towards investment-led growth, though
there are potential risks and drawbacks.
History suggests the long-term consequences of inaction could be severe
�
USA Inc. has many assets, but it must start addressing its spending/debt challenges now.

Sizing Costs Related to USA Inc.’s Key Financial Challenges
& Potential AND / OR Solutions
� To create frameworks for discussion, the next slide summarizes USA Inc.’s various
financial challenges and the projected future cost of each main expense driver.
� The estimated future cost is calculated as the net present value of expected
‘dedicated’ future income (such as payroll taxes) minus expected future expenses
(such as benefits paid) over the next 75 years.
� Then we ask the question: ‘What can we do to solve these financial challenges?’
�
The potential solutions include a range of simple mathematical illustrations (such as
changing program characteristics or increasing tax rates) and/or program-specific
policy solutions proposed or considered by lawmakers and agencies like the CBO
(such as indexing Social Security initial benefits to growth in cost of living).
� These mathematical illustrations are only a mechanical answer to key financial
challenges and not realistic solutions. In reality, a combination of detailed policy
changes will likely be required to bridge the future funding gap.

The Essence of America’s Financial Conundrum
& Math Problem?
While a hefty 80% of Americans indicate balancing the budget should
be one of the country’s top priorities, per a Peter G. Peterson
Foundation survey in 11/09…
…only 12% of Americans support cutting spending on Medicare or
Social Security, per a Pew Research Center survey, 2/11.
Some might call this ‘having your cake and eating it too…’

22
The Challenge Before Us
Policymakers, businesses and citizens need to share responsibility for
past failures and develop a plan for future successes.
Past generations of Americans have responded to major challenges
with collective sacrifice and hard work.
Will ours also rise to the occasion?

Net Worth Qualifier
• The balance sheet / net worth calculation does not include the power to tax
– the net present value of the sovereign power to tax and the ability to print the
world’s reserve currency would clearly bolster USA Inc.’s assets – if they could be
accurately calculated.
• Plant, Property & Equipment (PP&E) on USA Inc.’s balance sheet is valued
at $829B 1 (or 29% of USA Inc.’s total stated assets) – this includes tangible
assets such as buildings, internal use software and civilian and military
equipment.
• The PP&E calculation DOES NOT include the value of USA Inc.’s holdings in
the likes of public land (estimated to be worth $408B per OMB) 1 , highways,
natural gas, oil reserves, mineral rights (estimated to be worth $345B per OMB),
forest, air space, radio frequency spectrum, national parks and other heritage and
stewardship assets which USA Inc. does not anticipate to use for general
government operations. The good news for USA Inc. is that the aggregate value
of these heritage and stewardship assets could be significant.
Note: 1) USA Inc.’s holding of land is measured in non-financial units such as acres of land and lakes, and number of National Parks and National Marine
Sanctuaries. Land under USA Inc.’s stewardship accounts for 28% of the total U.S. landmass as of 9/10. Dept. of Interior reported 552 national wildlife refuges, 378
park units, 134 geographic management areas, 67 fish hatcheries under their management as of 9/10. Dept. of Defense reported 203,000 acres of public land and
16,140,000 acres withdrawn public land, the USDA’s Forest Service managed an estimated 155 national forests, while the Dept. of Commerce had 13 National
Marine Sanctuaries, which included near–shore coral reefs and open ocean, as of 9/10. Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S. Government.”

A Word of Warning About Comparing
Corporate & Government Accounting…
� Government accounting standards do not report the present value of future
entitlement payments (such as Social Security or Medicare) as liabilities.
Instead, entitlement payments are recognized only when they are paid.
� Our analysis takes a different view: governments create liabilities when they
enact entitlements and do not provide for revenues adequate to fund them.
� We measure the entitlement liability as the present value of estimated
entitlement payments in excess of expected revenues for citizens of working age
based on Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ actuarial analysis.
� Government accounting standards also do not recognize the value of internallygenerated
intangible assets (such as the sovereign power to tax). We do not
recognize those assets either, as we have no basis to measure them. But the
US government has substantial intangible assets that should provide future
economic benefits.
Note: For more discussion on alternatives to corporate and official government accounting methods, see Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Alan J. Auerbach, and Jagadeesh
Gokhale, “Generational Accounting: A Meaningful Way to Assess Generational Policy,” published on 12/94 in The Journal of Economic Perspectives.

…and About Government Budgeting
� Federal government budgeting follows arcane practices that are very different
from corporate budgeting – and can neglect solutions to structural problems in
favor of short-term expediency.
� Federal government does not distinguish capital budget (for long-term
investment) from operating budget (for day-to-day operations). As a result, when
funding is limited, government may choose to reduce investments for the future
to preserve resources for day-to-day operations.
� Budget “scoring” rules give Congress incentives to hide the true costs...and help
Congressional committees defend their turf.*
Note: *For more detail, refer to slide 116 on congressional budget scoring rules related to recent Healthcare reform.

Metric Definitions & Qualifiers
� Cash Flow = ‘Cash In’ Minus ‘Cash Out’
� Calculated on a cash basis (which excludes changes in non-cash accrual of
future liabilities) for simplicity.
� One-Time Expenses = ‘Spending Minus Repayments’ for Non-Recurring
Programs
� Net costs of programs such as TARP, ARRA, and GSE bailouts.
� Net Worth = Assets Minus Liabilities Minus Unfunded Entitlement Liabilities
� Assets include cash & investments, taxes receivable, property, plant &
equipment (as defined by Department of Treasury).
� Liabilities include accounts payable, accrued payroll & benefits, federal
debt, federal employee & veteran benefits payable…
� Unfunded Entitlement Liabilities include the present value of future
expenditures in excess of dedicated future revenues in Medicare and Social
Security over the next 75 years.

� Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio = -8x
� USA Inc. net debt held by public ($9.1 trillion) divided by USA Inc.
F2010 EBITDA (-$1.1 trillion). It’s notable that the ratio compares with
S&P500 average of 1.4x in 2010.

Note: 1) Congressional Budget Office defines a structural surplus or deficit as the budget surplus or deficit that would occur under current law if the influences of
the business cycle on the budget – the automatic stabilizers – were removed, and cyclical surplus or deficit as the automatic net changes in revenues and outlays
that are attributable to cyclical movements in real (inflation-adjusted) output and unemployment. CBO compiled this data from Dept. of Commerce’s Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA), which maintains the national income and product accounts (NIPA). An important difference between the official budget deficit and the
NIPA measure of net federal government saving is that the latter excludes such purely financial transactions as the sale of government assets, and most
transactions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, because those transactions do not help to measure current production and income. In addition, historical
NIPA data are subject to significant revision; historical budget data, by contrast, are rarely revised significantly. Source: 1996-2006 data per CBO, “The Effects of
Automatic Stabilizers on the Federal Budget,” 5/10, 2007-2010 data per White House OMB F2012 Budget Analytical Perspective.

Understanding Differences Between
Economist Language vs. Equity Investor Translation
Economist Language
� Budget Deficit – The amount by which a
government's expenditures exceed its
receipts over a particular period of time.
� Structural Deficit – The portion of the
budget deficit that results from a
fundamental imbalance in government
receipts and expenditures, as opposed to
one based on the business cycle or onetime
factors.
� Cyclical Deficit – The portion of the
budget deficit that results from cyclical
factors such as economic recessions
rather than from underlying fiscal policy.
Equity Investor Approximate Translation*
� Cash Flow – ‘Cash in’ minus ‘cash out.’
� Cash Flow (ex. One-Time Items)* –
‘Cash in’ minus ‘cash out’ excluding
expenditures that are one-time in nature
(such as economic stimulus spending).
� One-Time Expenses* – TARP / GSE /
stimulus spending related to economic
recession.
� Federal Debt Held By the Public – The
accumulation of all previous fiscal years’
deficits.
www.kpcb.com
� Debt – Cumulative negative cash flow
financed by borrowing.
Note: *We acknowledge that while the concept of ‘cash flow ex. one-time items’ and ‘one-time expenses’ is similar to ‘structural deficit’ and
‘cyclical deficit,’ respectively, these terms are not interchangeable and have different definitions. Congressional Budget Office defines a
structural surplus or deficit as the budget surplus or deficit that would occur under current law if the influences of the business cycle on the
budget – the automatic stabilizers – were removed, and cyclical surplus or deficit as the automatic net changes in revenues and outlays that
are attributable to cyclical movements in real (inflation-adjusted) output and unemployment.

How Did USA Inc.'s Financial Reality
Get to this Difficult Point?
USA Inc. Has Not Adequately Funded Its Entitlement Programs
Recessions come and go (and affect USA’s revenue), but future claims
(related to entitlement program commitments) on USA Inc. now
meaningfully exceed its projected cash flows.
For the last 40 years, management (the government) has committed
more long-term benefits through ‘entitlement’ programs like Medicaid /
Medicare / Social Security…without developing a sound plan to pay for
them.
Many of these programs provide important services to low-income,
unemployed, and disabled Americans in great need for help. But without
proper financing, support may dwindle.

USA Inc. Has Substantially Expanded
Its “Business Lines” Over Past 80 Years
From 1789 to 1930, 41% 1 of USA Inc.’s cumulative
budget was dedicated to defense spending (compared
with 20% 1 in F2010), per the Census Bureau.
This began to change in the 1930s, when the federal
government substantially expanded its role (in effect,
expanded its “business lines”) in response to the Great
Depression.
Note: 1) 41% is the cumulative defense spending (excluding veterans’ benefits and services) as % of cumulative total federal
spending from 1789 to 1930. Including veterans’ benefits and services, defense spending would have been 49% of cumulative
annual budget from 1789 to 1930 and would have been 22% in F2009. Source: Census Bureau, “Historical Statistics of the

Perspective –
USA Entitlement Spending = India’s GDP
• With a population of 1.2 billion (vs. USA’s 310 million) and
2010 GDP growth of 10% (vs. USA’s 3%), India is a wellrecognized
emerging country on the global stage.
• It’s notable that India’s 2010 nominal GDP* of $1.43
trillion was equal to USA’s $1.43 trillion in federal
government spending on Social Security, Medicare, and

The Original Estimates of Medicare’s Costs
Were Vastly Underestimated
• In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,
roughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*
• The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.
• Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest – expenditures)
has exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and
was $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been
accurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would
have been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.
• In fact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for
inflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.
• While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s
entitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.
� An accurate economic forecast might have sunk Medicare.

Many Leaders Have Voiced Concerns About
Entitlement Program Math / Spending
� The entitlement programs are not self-funded…they are unfunded
liabilities. They are the single biggest component of spending going
forward.
� -- Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve
� Testimony before House Budget Committee, June 9, 2010
� The time we have is growing short…there are serious questions, most
immediately about the sustainability of our commitment to growing
entitlement programs.
� -- Paul Volcker, Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve
� Chairman of President Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board
� Speech at Stanford University, May 18, 2010

Summary: 40-Year USA, Inc. Trends*
� America is spending beyond its means, and the problem – with mounting
losses & increasing debt – is getting worse, not better
� Healthcare spending and obesity are rising dramatically.
� Education spending is growing slower than healthcare spending.
� Defense spending is declining on relative basis.
� More and more Americans are on the government payroll or receive
government subsidies for retirement income, medical care, housing, and
food.
� Inequality of income and wealth is rising, and fewer Americans pay income
taxes to support USA Inc.
� Government increasingly resorts to borrowing to fund rising spending
levels (primarily for entitlement programs)…
Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of data points and trends. We did not
choose the most recent 40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent
significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual income and corporate
profit as well as federal budget surplus / deficit and debt levels) were significantly off their ‘normal’ levels.

What’s the Proper Level of This and That? What’s Normal?
We begin with the premise that for an enterprise (even a country
that can ‘print money’ and tax) to be sustainable, it cannot lose
money on an ongoing basis.
Successful businesses (and households) typically base their
expenses on their ability to generate present and future revenue
– in other words, they don’t spend unless they can pay.
We analyze the data and present scenarios and options for solving
the math and financial challenges facing USA Inc.

Conclusions: 100-Year Review of USA Inc. Income Statement
• America’s government has grown dramatically - USA Inc.’s revenue as percent of
GDP has risen from 2% to 15%. Individual / social insurance (Social Security +
Medicare) taxes have risen dramatically while customs / excise / estate taxes
have declined in relative importance. In addition, USA Inc.’s spending as percent
of GDP has risen to 24% in 2010, up from 3% average between 1790 and 1930.
• USA Inc.’s average operating income was at or near breakeven for most of the
periods from 1910 to 1970.
• In the 1970s, as healthcare expenses (related to Medicare and Medicaid) began
to surge, USA Inc. reported more frequent – and bigger – losses. Since 1970,
USA Inc. showed a profit just 4 times (F1998-F2001, when economic growth was
especially robust and defense spending was relatively low).
• General expense trends since 1970: non-defense discretionary spending has
been flattish (except in recessions with material one-time charges), healthcare
spending (largely Medicare + Medicaid) has risen materially, Social Security
spending has been flattish, defense spending has been down to flattish, and
interest payments varied with interest rates.

Operations of USA Inc. Are Solid,
Excluding Medicare / Medicaid and One-Time Charges
� Revenues of USA Inc. (largely from individual and corporate income and
payroll taxes) can fund most expenses (largely spending on defense,
Social Security, unemployment insurance, education, law enforcement,
transportation, energy, infrastructure, federal employee & veteran
benefits, and interest payments).
In fact, for USA Inc.'s operations besides Medicare / Medicaid and
one-time expenses, there’s ample scope to increase spending for
defense, education, law enforcement, transportation, infrastructure
and energy by ~4%* in aggregate and still remain break-even.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *Excluding Medicare / Medicaid revenue & expenses, USA Inc.’s expenses are, on average, 4% below revenue levels
from F1996 to F2010 based on our calculation of White House OMB data.

Defense Spending Is The Second-Largest Expense Item After
Entitlements, But Below Long-Term Trend as Share of GDP
• With budget deficits rising, some advocate cutting back on defense spending, the
second-largest expense item after entitlements.
• Defense spending has risen substantially in recent years, due to the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and other costs related to the Global War on Terror. As a
percentage of GDP, however, defense spending in the U.S. remains below its 60-
year trend.
• On an inflation-adjusted basis, U.S. defense spending is at its highest level since
World War II. With overhead ~40% of all spending, the Defense Business Board
found DoD consistently pays “more for less” and fails to attack overhead as the
private sector would. 1
• The Esquire Commission to Balance the Federal Budget, a group of four former
Republican and Democratic senators, found over $300 billion 2 in defense
restructuring opportunities, and other analysts proposed gradual cuts to reduce
the defense budget by 14% by 2018. 3

Entitlement Spending: Lacks Sufficient Dedicated Funding
� Entitlement programs were created with the best of intentions by
the Government. They serve many of the nation’s poorest, whose
struggles have been made worse by the financial crisis.
�
However, with the exception of Social Security (which was developed
with a pay-as-you-go funding plan and constructed to be legally flexible if
conditions change) and unemployment insurance (which was designed
to be flexible at State level), other entitlement plans (including Medicaid
and Medicare) were developed without sufficient dedicated funding.

Entitlement Spending: Observation About Social Security & Medicare
Part A Trust Fund – More Like Accounting Values Than Real Dollars
�
�
�
�
Social Security Trust Fund balance (accumulated annual surpluses + interest income) = $2.5 trillion as of
2009; Medicare Part A Trust Fund balance = $304 billion as of 2009. These surpluses were invested in a
special (non-marketable) series of U.S. Treasury securities, which were then used to finance budget deficits
in other parts of USA Inc. like Medicaid & Nutrition Assistance.
As a result, many observers have argued that Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds’ balances
are no more than accounting gains on paper owing to: 1) no ‘real’ assets (such as tradable stocks / real
estates…) in these Trust Funds as the special U.S. Treasury securities are non-marketable and 2) the
Treasury Department needs to raise taxes / cut other programs’ spending / borrow more money in the future
to meet any withdrawal requests.
We think that for Social Security and Medicare Part A programs, their Trust Funds’ balances have legal
value as USA Inc. is legally obliged to repay the principal and interest on the Treasury securities held in
respective Trust Funds.
However, we think that these Trust Fund balances have NO economic value as these cumulative surpluses
have been spent by USA Inc. to reduce the borrowing need in the past. When Social Security & Medicare
begin net withdrawal from their Trust Funds (likely in 2017E), USA Inc.’s debt levels + interest payments
growth could accelerate, owing to the double whammy of: 1) loss of revenue source (previous surpluses)
and 2) additional Treasury redemption costs related to Trust Funds’ withdrawal requests.
�
Consequently, we exclude Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ balances and interest income
from our financial models and calculate their liabilities on a net basis.
Data source: Social Security Administration, Dept. of Health & Human Services, CBO. Note: the economic value of Social Security Trust Fund is subject

Entitlement Spending: Non-Partisan CBO Advises Excluding Social Security /
Medicare Trust Funds’ Balances + Interest Income in Fiscal Analysis
� Trust funds can be useful mechanisms for monitoring the balance between
earmarked receipts and a program's spending, but they are basically an
accounting device, and their balances, even if "invested" in Treasury securities,
provide no resources to the government for meeting future funding commitments.
When those payments come due, the government must finance them in the
same way that it finances other commitments -- through taxes or borrowing from
the public. Thus, assessing the state of the federal government's future finances
requires measuring such commitments independently of their trust fund status or
the balance recorded in the funds.

Entitlement Spending: Funding Patterns of Some
Entitlement Programs Work Better than Others
Have Worked Relatively Well Financially:
• Social Security – Has operated at close to break-even - so far - thanks to sufficient payroll
tax income from a relatively large working-age population. In fact, Social Security has
worked so well, that its surplus net income has been used to finance other government
activities such as Medicaid.
• Unemployment Insurance – Has operated at close to break-even thanks to accumulated
net incomes during ‘good years’ (though expenses spiked to $123 billion / $160 billion in
2009 / 2010 from $45 billion in 2008 owing to recession).
Have Worked Relatively Poorly Financially:
• Medicaid – Has operated at an average annual loss of $160 billion with, in effect, an
average net margin of -100% over past 15 years; the annual dollar loss has risen from $108
billion to $273 billion because of rising healthcare costs and expanded enrollment.
• Medicare – Has operated at an average annual loss of $123 billion with, in effect, an
average net margin of -83% over past 15 years; the margin has fallen from -66% to -154%
(or -$64 billion in annual loss to -$272 billion) because of rising healthcare costs +
expanding coverage (added Part D prescription drug benefits through legislation in 2003,
rolled out in 2006).

� Entitlement revenue was $0.87 trillion, yet entitlement
spending was $1.98 trillion in F2010.
� Entitlement spending exceeded entitlement revenue by
129% in F2010.
� Social Security (ex. Trust Fund interest income) accounted
for 73% of dedicated entitlement revenue yet only 36% of
entitlement spending in F2010 while Medicare accounted for
21% of revenue and 23% of spending and Medicaid
accounted for 0% of revenue and 14% of spending.

Entitlement Spending: Clarification On
‘Unfunded’ / ‘Net Responsibilities’…
� There is debate about the semantics of using words like unfunded / net
responsibilities to describe the financial status of entitlement programs like Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
� ‘Unfunded’ – We define ‘unfunded’ liabilities for Social Security and Medicare as
the present value of future expenditures in excess of dedicated future revenue.
We call Social Security and Medicare ‘partially unfunded’ entitlement programs
as their future expenditures are projected to exceed dedicated future revenue.
� ‘Net Responsibilities’ – USA Inc. does not record these ‘unfunded’ financial
commitments as explicit liabilities on balance sheet, owing to Federal accounting
standards. 1
� USA Inc.’s Dept. of Treasury calls these commitments ‘net responsibilities’
or ‘net expenditures’ in its annual Financial Report of the U.S. Government.
� Medicaid – We view Medicaid as an ‘unfunded’ liability as there is no dedicated
revenue source to match expected expenses in our financial analysis. Medicaid
is jointly funded on a pay-as-you go basis by Federal and State general tax
revenue.

…Entitlement Spending: Clarification On
‘Unfunded’ / ‘Net Responsibilities’
� Unless they are reduced, USA Inc.’s financial liabilities -- whether they are actual
debt or the present value of future promises, whether called ‘unfunded’ liabilities or
‘net responsibilities’ and whether funded by dedicated taxes or general revenue –
represent significant claims on USA Inc.’s future economic resources.
� To be sure, the projected unfunded liabilities are not the same as debt, because
Congress can change the laws that are behind those future promises. With a few
exceptions, however, over the past 60 years, lawmakers have acted to boost rather
than reduce them.

Entitlement Spending: Observation from Previous Slide
� Clearly, lower interest rates have allowed Americans to
borrow more and save less. But given the high correlation
between rising entitlement income for beneficiaries and
declining savings rates, one might also wonder if Americans
feel less compelled to save money as they feel that they can
depend on the government to give them money.

Next, We Drill Down on Entitlement Programs…
• We begin with the programs with the least sound
financials (Medicaid and Medicare) and end with the
programs with the most sound financials
(Unemployment Insurance and Social Security), as of
today.
• We then move to a drilldown of rising healthcare costs
after the Medicaid and Medicare drilldowns.

Medicaid: Facing Accelerating Cash Flow Deficits
� Social Welfare Program – Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-income
population (2% of Americans under coverage then and 16% now*).
� No Dedicated Funding – Federal funding comes from general revenue (all forms of tax
receipts).
� Ever-Growing Expenses – $273 billion in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago.
� Rising Healthcare Costs – Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles +
technology advances.
�
�
Growing Beneficiary + Benefits – Covered beneficiaries expanded beyond lowincome
group in 1980s to include additional groups (like individuals who have high
medical expenses and have spent down their assets, and some of those who lost
their employer-sponsored healthcare insurance coverage in recession), while
covered benefits expanded to include prescription drugs / dental services. Total
expenditures on these new groups and benefits represented ~60% of Medicaid
program’s spending in 2001, per Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. See
slide 319-322 for more details.
Moral Hazard – As a “free good,” Medicaid reduced demand for private long-term
insurance 1 while regulation loopholes + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the Medicaid reimbursement system.

Medicaid: Observations
� 49 million (26MM low-income children / 12MM low-income adults / 7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (16% of population) received an
average of $4,684 in tax-payer funded payments from the federal
government for healthcare in 2009. For context, $6,872 in healthcare
benefits is 13% of average annual per-capita income for Americans.
� When Medicaid was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to lowincome
Americans, 1 in 50 Americans received Medicaid, now 1 in 6
Americans receives Medicaid.
� That said, Medicaid is an important benefit for recipients as it provides
access to healthcare for low-income adults and their children. In recent
years, Medicaid beneficiaries and benefit payments have risen faster than
population and per-capita income growth owing to expanded coverage,
economic difficulties and associated sluggish wage growth for low- and
lower-middle-income families, and continued healthcare cost inflation.

Medicaid: While We Focus on Federal Government Dynamics, It’s Notable
that State Government Medicaid Funding Also Faces Significant Challenges
�
�
Medicaid = Major and Growing Expense Line Item for State Governments
�
�
�
Medicaid funding responsibility is shared between federal & state governments. States with higher
per-capita income (like New York) pay ~50% of total Medicaid cost while states with lower per-capita
income (like Mississippi) pay ~22%.
On average, Medicaid accounted for 21% of total state spending in F2009 (ranging from Missouri at
35% to Alaska at 8%). Enrollment growth has been accelerating, in part, owing to more people losing
employer-sponsored health insurance in the recession, and thus overall Medicaid costs jumped ~11%
Y/Y from October, 2009 to June, 2010.
State governments (which unlike the federal government must balance their annual budgets) cannot
pay for such elevated levels of Medicaid and maintain normal spending levels for other services (like
education and public safety).
Enter the Federal Government
�
ARRA (2009 economic stimulus) provided ~$100 billion in support for the states to pay for elevated
levels of Medicaid costs and to avoid large budget cuts in education and public safety. This went a
long way toward holding down the states’ contribution, but it is a one-time unsustainable fix.
� Federal Support May Be Expiring by June, 2011
�
If no action is taken, the Medicaid-related cost burden on the states will rise dramatically in coming
years. As a result, many states are on the verge of implementing Medicaid cost containment plans
that include cuts in doctor payments, benefit limitations, higher patient co-payments, etc. Moreover,
many states are fearful that the recently enacted healthcare reform will lead to additional Medicaidrelated
costs when it goes into full effect in 2014.

Medicare: Complex Social Insurance Program
With Insufficient Funding
� Social Insurance Program – Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to the elderly (65+).
� Four Parts – A) Hospital Insurance (to cover inpatient expenses, introduced in 1965); B)
Medical Insurance (optional outpatient expenses, 1965); C) Medicare Advantage Plans
(private alternative to A&B, 1997) and D) Prescription Drug Coverage (enacted 2003).
� Funding Mechanism Varies
� Part A has dedicated funding via payroll taxes (2.9% of total payroll), though has been
running at an annual deficit since 2008 as related payments exceed taxes; Trust Fund is
expected to be depleted by 2017E, per Social Security Administration.
� Part B & D has no dedicated funding (75% of funding came from government allocation /
25% came from enrollees’ premium payments).
� Part C funding came Part A & Part B.
� Ever-Growing Expenses – $452 billion expenses in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago
� Rising Healthcare Costs – Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles + technology
advances.
� Moral Hazard – As a “free good,” Medicare reduced demand for private long-term
insurance 1 while loopholes in the regulations + need-based benefit policies created
incentives to abuse the system.

Medicare: Observations
� 46 million elderly Americans (15% of population) received an average
of $8,325 in tax-payer funded payments for healthcare in 2009 ($5,079
for hospital care; $3,246 for medical insurance & prescription drugs).
� On the surface, $8,325 in free healthcare benefits every year certainly
seems like a high number – 23% of annual per-capita income –
(although working Medicare recipients do pay Medicare taxes).
� As with employer-sponsored health insurance plans, if people, in effect, get
a free benefit (with little personal financial commitment), they may not be
especially diligent and frugal about how they ‘spend’ it. The same concept
extends beyond healthcare recipients to the healthcare providers.*
� When Medicare was created in 1965 to provide health insurance to elderly
Americans, 1 in 10 Americans received Medicare, now 1 in 7 Americans receives
Medicare…above the initial ‘plan.’

Think About That…
� Total government spending on healthcare (including Medicare, Medicaid and
other programs) has risen 7x from 1.2% of GDP in 1960 to 8.2% in 2009 while
total government spending on education has risen only 0.6x from 4% of GDP in
1960 to 6% in 2009.
� Medicare and Medicaid, which did not exist in 1960, rose to 35% of total healthcare
spending in 2009, while out-of-pocket spending declined to 12% of total healthcare
spending in 2009 (or $894 per person per year*), down from 47% in 1960 (or $478
per person*).
� Lifetime healthcare costs for the average American are $631,000, of which the
government pays for an estimated 48% while private insurers (like UnitedHealth and
Blue Cross Blue Shield) pay 32% and consumers pay just 12%.
� When citizens don’t need to pay directly for something (like healthcare) and are given
an expensive good / service for free (or well below cost), they tend to consume more
of it – it’s basic supply and demand economics.
� This approach faces increasing challenges as USA, Inc. has gone deeper and
deeper in debt to pay for it…

� Issues With Official Cost Estimates to Consider
�
�
�
�
Deficit neutral status somewhat reliant on future lawmakers’ willingness to implement Medicare
savings/reimbursement reductions:
� Reductions in payment rates for many types of Healthcare providers relative to the rates that
would have been paid under prior law (always a politically difficult decision).
� However the good news is that recommendations from the Independent Payment Advisory
Board focused on reducing growth in per capita Medicare spending if it exceeds target
automatically become the law without congressional intervention if Congress allows IPAB to
operate as planned.
CBO estimates the effects of proposals as written: CBO acknowledges that it is unclear whether
reform can actually reduce the annual growth rate in Medicare spending from 4% (historical
average) to 2% for the next two decades, as PPACA estimates assume.
Relies on excise taxes on sectors of the healthcare industry that could be passed through to
consumers via price increases.
Starting in 2018, assumes taxation of high premium employment-based health insurance plans.
� Opportunities For Cost Savings to Consider
�
�
Increased access to preventative care could potentially slow down overall healthcare cost growth.
Such potential effect is not captured in CBO scoring.
Investments in information technology and new provider & consumer incentives can drive better
and more efficient care.

PPACA –
There Is Potential for ‘Unintended’ Consequences
� The new law changes some system incentives, which may lead to new behavior
patterns, many of which are complex and hard to predict.
� The market may adapt to new MLR (Medical Loss Ratio) rules that incentivize
and reward a very specific (but ultimately arbitrary) cost structure.
� The cost/benefit analysis for employers and consumers may change, and
some may opt to re-evaluate their current employer-sponsored coverage
offerings.
� Health plans that are no longer economically viable may exit markets, potentially
adding to the uninsured problem prior to 2014.
� Likely acceleration in consolidation of payers as well as providers.

Historical Anecdote – “An Accurate Economic Forecast Might Have
Sunk Medicare & Medicaid [in 1965]”
• In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,
roughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*
• The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.
• Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest – expenditures)
has exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and
was $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been
accurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would
have been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.
• In fact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for
inflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.
• While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s
entitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.

However, More Recent Healthcare Entitlement Such as Medicare
part D Has Cost Less Than Expected
� Medicare Part D (the 2006 outpatient drug benefit for seniors) was projected to
cost $111 billion annually.
� In 2009, Medicare Part D’s actual cost = $61 billion, 45% below projection.
� The government originally projected 43 million beneficiaries in 2009, but only 33
million seniors (23% below projection) elected to participate in 2009.
� Medicare Part D was outsourced to the private sector, and seniors elected to
enroll in plans operated primarily by managed care organizations, which utilize a
variety of techniques to reduce costs and improve the quality of care.
� The Washington Times stated on August 16 th 2010 – "The lower cost - a result of
slowing demand for prescription drugs, higher use of generic drugs and fewer
people signing up - has surprised even some of the law's most pessimistic
critics."
� The Part D experience has given some observers hope that PPACA will not cost
more than anticipated.

Unemployment Benefits: Long-Term Break-Even,
Though Prone to Cyclicality
� Social Insurance Program – Created in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act
to provide temporary financial assistance to eligible workers who are
unemployed through no fault of their own (via layoffs or natural disasters).
� Funded via Taxing Employers – Employers pay federal government 0.8% of
payroll (in addition to various levels of state unemployment insurance taxes) to
fund the Federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.
� Funding = Pro-Cyclical – Rising employment increases revenue and reduces
benefit payments, generally leading to surpluses, while falling employment
reduces revenue and increases benefits payments, leading to periodically large
deficits during recessions.
� Flexible at the State Level by Design – State governments set policies on
unemployment benefit eligibility / duration / tax levels, while federal government
provide financial and legal oversight.
� Generally Break-Even – In 29 of the past 49 years, Federal unemployment
insurance programs have had surpluses. Excluding the 2009 / 2010 loss,
unemployment insurance had a cumulative surplus of $53 billion from 1962 to
2008.

Unemployment Benefits: Bad News—Structural Problems in Labor Force
Could Lead to Prolonged Duration/Increased Rate of Unemployment
� Structural Problems in USA Labor Force
� Healthcare costs may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� Healthcare benefits = 8% of average total employee compensation; grew at
6.9% CAGR from 1998 to 2008 compared with 4.5% CAGR in salaries.
� Healthcare benefits are fixed costs as they are paid on an annual per-worker
basis and do not vary with hours worked.
� As employers try to lower fixed costs to right-size to their reduced revenue
levels, layoffs are the only way to reduce fixed healthcare costs.
� Skills mismatch may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� A large portion of the long-term unemployed may lack requisite skills.
� 14% of firms reported difficulty filling positions due to the lack of suitable talent,
per 5/10 Manpower Research survey.
� Labor immobility resulting from the housing bust may be a barrier to hiring
� One in four homeowners are “trapped” because they owe more than their
houses are worth, so they cannot move to take another job – until they sell or
walk away.

Unemployment Benefits: Bad News
Although economists have shown that extended availability of UI
[unemployment insurance] benefits will increase unemployment duration, the
effect in the latest downturn appears quite small compared with other
determinants of the unemployment rate. Our analyses suggest that extended
UI benefits account for about 0.4 percentage point of the nearly 6 percentage
point increase in the national unemployment rate over the past few years. It is
not surprising that the disincentive effects of UI would loom small in the midst
of the most severe labor market downturn since the Great Depression.
Despite the relatively minor influence of extended UI, it is important to note that
the 0.4 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate represents about
600,000 potential workers who could become virtually unemployable if their
reliance on UI benefits were to continue indefinitely.

Social Security: In Good Shape Now, Yet Challenged in Future
by Aging Population
� Social Insurance Program Created in 1935 – During height of the Great
Depression to help elderly (65+*) and disabled people avoid poverty.
� Pay-as-You-Go Funding – Social Security taxes deducted from current payrolls
to pay out to current eligible recipients of Social Security.
� For Most of its 8 Decades (1935-1970; 1985 - 2009), Annual Social Security
Payments Have Been Funded by Annual Social Security Taxes – However,
based on estimates from Congressional Budget Office (CBO), beginning in 2016
(or earlier), Social Security will begin running an annual deficit as payments
exceed taxes (at unchanged flat tax rate of 12.4% 1 of annual gross wages) – this
is a problem!
� Social Security Has Been Struck by Annual Deficit Crisis Before – From
1975 to 1981, Social Security expenses exceeded revenue every year, which
caused a 45% reduction in the Social Security Trust Fund balance. Legislation
recommended by the Greenspan Commission in 1983 reduced average benefits
by ~5% 2 and raised social insurance tax rates for individuals by ~2.3%. 3 But the
Greenspan Commission fix will run out soon as Social Security turns to operating
loss in 2016.
Note: *Early retirees (62+) could receive partial benefits between 62 and 65. 1) 6.2% taxes paid by employees and matched by employers on gross wages up to
but not exceeding the Social Security wage base of ~$100K; 2) total benefit cuts included $27B savings from benefit taxation for the wealthy and $66B savings
from delay in cost of living adjustments over 1984-1989; 3) average increase in entitlement payroll tax rates between 1982 and 1988, includes Medicare payroll

Social Security: Observations
� 52 million retired Americans (17% of population) received an
average of $11,826 (in 2005 dollars) in Social Security payments
(32% of USA per-capita income) in 2009.
� By comparison, 10 million retired Americans (6% of population)
received an average of $5,447 (in 2005 dollars) in Social Security
payments (51% of per-capita income) in 1957.
� When Social Security was created in early 20 th century to provide
retirement income to elderly Americans, 1 in 127 Americans 1 (<1% of
population) received Social Security payments. Now 1 in 6 Americans
(17%) receive Social Security payments…well above the initial ‘plan.’

That’s a Math Problem…
� If an expense rises by 26% and the ability to pay rises by only 3%,
the math doesn’t work. A computer in a science fiction movie might
blurt out, ‘does not compute…does not compute…’
� ‘’Something’s Gotta Give…’ as the 2003 film put it.
� A mathematician or economist would say, ‘the expense must go down or
the ability to pay must rise to match the expense.’
� Simple math implies that the age for collecting full benefits should rise
from 67 to 72, so that expenses more closely match workers’ ability to
pay. Under this scenario, while Americans are living 30% longer, the
‘retirement’ age would rise just 7%, still well below the increase in life
expectancy since Social Security was created.

In Sum…
Heretofore, Social Security and Unemployment Insurance
have been effectively funded, but two significant entitlement
programs (Medicaid and Medicare) were created without
effective funding plans / programs. Only one of these
(Medicaid) is means-tested (indicating that one is eligible for
Medicaid only if he / she does not sufficient financial means).
Left unchanged, Unemployment Insurance funding should
improve as economic growth resumes, but Social Security will no
longer be self-funded within 5-10 years, and the underfunding of
Medicaid and Medicare will simply go from bad to worse.

Debt Level: In the Past, Social Security’s Surpluses Have Masked
USA Inc.’s True Borrowing Needs by $1.4T
� Social Security tax receipts exceeded outlays in every year between 1984 and 2008,
leading to a cumulative surplus of $1.4 trillion.
� These surpluses have been used to fund other parts of federal government operations
(including Medicaid, infrastructure and defense...) under the unified budget accounting
rules.
� Without these past Social Security surpluses, USA Inc. would have to have issued $1.4
trillion more debt (or 16% higher than current level of debt) to fund its operations.

Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Data in our chart is based on CBO’s ‘alternative fiscal scenario’ forecast, which assumes a continuation of today’s underlying
fiscal policy. Note that CBO also maintains an ‘extended-baseline’ scenario, which adheres closely to current law. The alternative fiscal scenario deviates from
CBO’s baseline because it incorporates some policy changes that are widely expected to occur (such as extending the 2001-2003 tax cuts rather than letting them
expire as scheduled by current law and adjusting physician payment rates to be in line with the Medicare economic index rather than at lower scheduled rates) and
that policymakers have regularly made in the past.

for the Treasury based on 10/1/10 closing price. Including this potential gain, TARP ultimate cost to the Treasury would be $29B. 2) White House OMB estimates
ultimate cash cost of Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac at $165B while the CBO estimates the ultimate cash costs at $160B. Both estimates imply an average default rate of
5-10% on Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac’s $5T loan guarantee portfolio and a loss severity of 50%. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) estimates ultimate
costs to range from $142B to $259B. 3) Net cash costs are limited to discretionary spending items in ARRA. Source: CBO, U.S. Dept of Treasury, White House

Drill Down on One-Time Charges
Most of USA Inc.’s recent one-time charges are directly or
indirectly related to America’s real estate bubble and
aggressive borrowing.
First we look at the drivers of the real estate bubble (we call it
‘anatomy of a real estate bubble’), then we drill down on the
past / present / future financial impact of the three types of
one-time charges and the recipients:
1) TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program)
2) GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises)

Investors Struggle with Today’s Low ~4% Risk Free Rate
• Pension funds & other investors look for ~8% annual returns
in order to meet promised payouts.
• The challenge is far greater than before given:
• Rising obligations relative to income
• Lower interest rates
• Promises (e.g., pension, healthcare) made during an 8%
interest rate environment are much harder to meet when the
risk free rate has fallen from 8% to 3.6%. 1
• The choice is either to reduce obligations…
or
…Invest in riskier assets.

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP):
Recipient of 38% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding*
� In TARP, the financial rescue program (created in October, 2008),
USA Inc. purchased assets and equity from financial institutions to
provide the capital and liquidity needed during the 2008 financial
crisis (which followed the real estate bubble).
In 2009, TARP recipients were broadened to include automakers, an
insurance company (AIG), individual homeowners, small & mediumsized
businesses and other non-bank financial institutions.
To date, USA Inc. loaned these institutions $464 billion and received
$250 billion in repayment and warrant proceeds for a net outstanding
loan balance of $214 billion.

Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs):
Recipients of 28% of Net Government (Taxpayer) Funding
� GSEs Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac extended their guarantees on residential
mortgages from conventional loans into Alt-A, interest-only and subprime
loans.
� While technically not part of the federal government, Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac
have enjoyed an implicit government guarantee on their debt and RMBS
securities as investors believed (correctly, as it turned out) that the federal
government would support these entities if they failed. As a result, GSEs’ longterm
debt securities receive AAA/Aaa ratings from all rating agencies and are
classified by financial markets as “agency securities” with interest rates above
USA Treasuries but below AAA corporate debts.
� Post placing Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac into a government conservatorship,
USA Inc. has so far invested $152B 1 into these two GSEs with an estimated $8-
13B 2 more likely over the next 10 years, given the ongoing weakness in housing
market and the poor underwriting by Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac.

Fannie Mae established in
1938 to provide liquidity to
the primary and secondary
mortgage markets
Freddie Mac established in
1970 after the Emergency
Home Finance Act to
provide further liquidity to
the mortgage markets
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
placed into conservatorship
at a time when they
guaranteed 57% of the $12
trillion USA mortgage market
1938 1968 1970 1988 2008
Fannie Mae became a publicly traded company in
9/68, in part to reduce rising government debt
levels from the Vietnam War by taking Fannie Mae
debt off USA Inc.’s balance sheet
Freddie Mac became a
publicly traded company in
12/88 with an initial market
cap of $3 billion
Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac – What do they do?
They are insurance and investment companies. Both buy residential and
multifamily mortgages which conform to their underwriting standards from banks
and other originators. They either hold them in their portfolios or package them
into residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). These securities, which
carry Fannie and Freddie’s guarantee on them, are then sold to investors
(banks, insurance companies, bond funds, etc.).

USA Inc. Net Worth:
-$44 Trillion in Perspective
There are doubts about the accuracy of such a big negative number, especially when the value
of USA Inc.’s assets is so hard to calculate. The value of natural resources, the power to tax,
the ability to print the world’s reserve currency, the human capital in our educational system –
these and other assets would clearly reduce that number, if they could be accurately
calculated.
Given the differences between government and corporate accounting, what matters is not the
exact number, but the trend – which is clearly moving in the wrong direction. Liabilities have
been growing faster than assets. Just to put that $57 trillion into context…

Important Caveats on F2010 Medicare Liability Improvement
�
�
�
Medicare Part A and Part B unfunded liability improved to -$16 trillion in F2010, up 47% from -$31 trillion in
F2009, per the Board of Medicare Trustees.
The improvement was driven primarily by downward revisions of future cost growth assumptions following
enactment of healthcare reform in 2010.
However, Medicare’s Chief Actuary Richard Foster noted that “while the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended, makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its
financial outlook, there is a strong likelihood that certain of these changes will not be viable in the
long range…Without major changes in health care delivery systems, the prices paid by Medicare for health
services [as scheduled by current law] are very likely to fall increasingly short of the costs of providing these
services…Congress would have to intervene to prevent the withdrawal of providers from the Medicare
market and the severe problems with beneficiary access to care that would result. Overriding the productivity
adjustments, as Congress has done repeatedly in the case of physician payment rates, would lead to far
higher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected under current law…For these
reasons, the financial projections shown [here] for Medicare do not represent a reasonable
expectation for actual program operations in either the short range (as a result of the unsustainable
reductions in physician payment rates) or the long range (because of the strong likelihood that the statutory
reductions in price updates for most categories of Medicare provider services will not be viable).”

� Unfunded promise of future entitlement spending grew 6x to -$31
trillion, owing to rapidly rising healthcare cost + new Medicare Part D
program + aging population in the medium-future.
� Federal net debt outstanding more than doubled to $9 trillion on the

and growing entitlement spending.
� Federal employee & veteran benefits outstanding also more than
doubled, to $5.7 trillion, thanks to rising healthcare costs and ongoing

What Might a Turnaround Expert—
Empowered to Improve USA Inc.’s
Financials—Consider?
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider?
221
First, Examine USA Inc. Key Drivers of Revenue & Expenses…
� USA Inc.'s Revenue = Highly Correlated (83%) with GDP Growth*
� 90% of USA Inc.'s 2010 revenue derived from taxing individual and corporate
income, which depends on GDP growth and changes to tax rates / composition.
� USA Inc.'s Expenses = Less (73%) Correlated with GDP Growth*
� Entitlement Programs = 57% of USA Inc.'s expenses in 2010
� driven by government policy + demographic changes
� Defense Programs = 20% of expenses
� driven by external threat levels and policy
� Net Interest Payments = 6% of expenses
� driven by net debt level + interest rates + composition of debt maturity
Observation: while revenue is highly correlated with GDP growth, expenses
are less so.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *Historical inflation-adjusted correlation between GDP and revenue / expense Y/Y growth rates from 1940 to 2010, GDP / revenue
adjusted using GDP deflator; expenses adjusted using White House OMB’s composite outlay deflator. Nominal revenue / GDP correlation
over the same period is 84%; expense / GDP correlation is 71%. Data source: White House Office of Management & Budget, CBO.
USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 222
Then, Aim to Determine What ‘Normal’ Is…
� We review 40-year income statement patterns and focus on
‘average’ / ‘normal’ levels of USA Inc.’s revenue drivers
(primarily related to taxes) and expense drivers (by category)
as a percent of revenue, as a starting point to help define
‘average’ / ‘normal.’
� Established businesses typically determine their expense
levels based on their revenue trend / outlook.
� In a perfect world, the government (and its citizens) would
continually review the multiple variables in the income
statement of USA Inc. (in a bipartisan way) and would
work hard to foster compromise, in order to optimize
revenue and expenses for the long term AND the short term.

Revenue Growth: Observations from Previous Slide
� We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of
revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent 40-year period (1969
to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant
tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual
income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.
� Total USA Inc. revenue (collected via taxes) has grown at an average 3%
annual rate, in-line with 40-year GDP growth rate. Corporate taxes have – on
average – grown at 2% annually over 40 years. Social insurance taxes (for
Social Security and Medicare) have grown at an average 5% annual rate,
above the 3% GDP growth.
Questions:
1) How crucial is the role played by lower relative tax rates – especially for
corporations – in stimulating job and GDP growth and helping American maintain /
gain / constrain loss of global competitive advantage?
� 2) Should social insurance tax growth be more closely aligned with GDP growth?

Revenue Drivers as Percent of Revenue:
Observations from Previous Slide
� Social Insurance taxes (for entitlement programs) have risen materially
to 37% of revenue (vs. 33% 40-year average), and have risen
aggressively from 19% in 1965, owing to introduction of Medicare in
1965 and the 1983 reform of social security taxes.
� Questions:
1) What level of social insurance / entitlement ‘tax’ can USA Inc. support on
an on-going basis? Rising from 19% of revenue in 1965 to 33% of revenue
in 2005 – of which 75% was spent on healthcare – takes its toll on other
areas of spending / growth. There are serious tradeoffs - every dollar that
goes to entitlement programs is not spent on education, infrastructure, and
defense.
� 2) Why have corporate income taxes fallen to 13% of revenue in 2009 from
22% in 1965 aside from recession? How crucial has this been to maintain
global competitive advantage and stimulating American job and GDP
growth?

payments have risen 3%, and defense plus non-defense discretionary
spending (including education, infrastructure, law enforcement and
judiciary) have risen by 1%. These different growth rates have become
even more pronounced in recent years.
� Questions:
1) Isn’t it time for a re-set and acknowledgment of trade-offs? Should taxes,
non-defense discretionary spending, and defense spending grow in line with
GDP over time? Should entitlement spending be restructured to be more
efficient and supportable by the ongoing financial dynamics of USA, Inc. and
also grow in line with or below GDP?

Category Expenses as Percent of Expenses:
Observations from Previous Slide
� Entitlement spending has risen to 51% of total spending, higher than 40-
year average of 42% (and much higher than the 21% in 1965), defense
spending has fallen to 20% from 24% average, non-defense discretionary
spending (including education, infrastructure, energy, law enforcement
and veteran services) has fallen to 22% from 23%, and net interest
payments have fallen to 7% from 11%, despite higher debt (largely because
of declining interest rates). These trends have become more pronounced
in recent years.
� Questions:
1) Should entitlement spending account for 51% (and rising) share of total USA
Inc.’s spending, while other key areas (such as education, infrastructure, energy,
law enforcement…) account for only 22% (and falling) of spending?

Bottom Line, as Data in This Presentation Indicate…
� USA Inc.’s expenses far exceed revenue – and government
projections imply this trend will get worse, not better.
�
In addition - while not addressed in depth in this presentation - USA Inc.
(while still a global powerhouse), at the margin, is losing competitive
advantage to many other countries.
� Instead of ignoring the problems, we simply ask the question…
How would a financial / turnaround expert look at USA Inc.’s financials,
business model, strategic plans, efficiency and aim to drive the
‘business’ to break-even (or a modest profit) over the next
5-10 years?
www.kpcb.com

Matching Expenses & Revenue:
Imperatives & Constraints
There are many reasons to make changes
� USA Inc. is losing money, and forecasts imply it will continue to lose money.
� Net debt levels (62% in F2010) are expected to surpass 90% threshold* – above
which real GDP growth could slow by more than one percentage point – by 2021E.
� Spending (primarily related to entitlement programs) is at unsustainable levels
based on USA Inc.’s ability to fund the spending (without increasing debt levels).
� Americans rank ‘reducing America’s debt’ as one of country’s top priorities,
according to a national survey by Peter G. Peterson Foundation in 11/09.
� We are now in the midst of a major generational baton-passing (from the Baby
Boomers to Generation X) which requires preparation for policy change.
� Foreigners own 46% (and rising) of USA Inc.’s debt, per Treasury Department –
Are they going to keep funding USA Inc.’s spending?
Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the relationship between government debt
and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average
growth falls considerably more. We note that while Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer
to the European countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.

Matching Expenses & Revenue:
Imperatives & Constraints
There are many constraints to making changes
� ~90 million citizens (29% of Americans) 1 have grown accustomed to entitlement
programs - 47MM on Medicaid, 45MM on Medicare, and 51MM on Social
Security, and many of them vote.
� Politicians depend on re-election campaigns, which can create conflicts,
especially given that only 12% of the population are willing to cut Social Security
and Medicare benefits, per Pew survey in 2/11.
� Low personal savings rates (near 6% of disposable income in CQ2:10), high
unemployment (near 10%) and economic uncertainty, which can limit ability to
make radical change.
� 14 million healthcare-related workers 2 have grown accustomed to relatively high
healthcare spending.

235
And Then There’s the Constraint of
USA Inc.’s Weak Economy
� [The] typical error most countries make coming out of a
financial crisis is they shift too quickly to premature restraint.
You saw that in the United States in the 30s, you saw that in
Japan in the 90s. It is very important for us to avoid that
mistake. If the government does nothing going forward, then
the impact of policy in Washington will shift from supporting
economic growth to hurting economic growth.

� The recovery of a [challenged] company [or country]…depends on the
implementation of an appropriate rescue plan or turnaround prescription.

fundamental problems; 2) tackle the underlying causes (rather than the
symptoms) and 3) be broad and deep enough in scope to resolve all the
key issues.

Three Principles for a USA Inc. ‘Turnaround’
from Louis Gerstner
�
Do not impose "across-the-board" cost reductions
�
This is a simple and tempting remedy for an organization in fiscal trouble. But it is almost always
unproductive. A truly effective organization needs incremental investments in programs that drive
innovation and higher productivity. Moreover, across-the-board cuts are almost guaranteed to reduce
morale, promote short-sighted choices, and encourage accounting gimmicks that send people looking for
loopholes instead of creative solutions.
�
Focus on programs, not costs
�
The greatest productivity gains come from asking questions such as: What things are we doing now that
we do not need as much in the future? Can we eliminate them? Reduce their size? Provide them in a
totally restructured fashion?
�
Allow no exceptions
�
To drive a truly effective restructuring program, everything must be on the table. There can be no sacred
cows—no part of the organization that is exempt from scrutiny. Every unit of the organization may not
face a cut, but every unit needs to be rethought.

Financial Experts Tend to ‘Assume What Can Go Wrong,
Will Go Wrong,’ and Usually Manage Expenses in that Way
�
In projecting scenarios, financial experts would note that USA Inc.’s revenue and expenses are highly
correlated to economic changes – for example, a 0.1 percentage point slowdown in real GDP annual
growth rate could worsen USA Inc.’s F2011-F2020E budget deficit by $288B, or 5% owing to lower tax
revenue and higher welfare spending.

Note: Medicaid funding is appropriated by Congress (from general tax revenue) on an as-needed basis every year, therefore,
there is no need to maintain a contingency reserve, and, unlike Medicare, the “financial status” of the program is not in question
from an actuarial perspective. Here we estimated the net present value of future Medicaid spending through 2085E, assuming a
3% discount rate. Data source: Dept. of Treasury, Dept. of Health & Human Services Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

USA Inc.’s Financial Disconnect
� The country faces a fundamental disconnect between the
services the people expect the government to provide,
particularly in the form of benefits for older Americans, and
the tax revenues that people are willing to send to the
government to finance those services. That fundamental
disconnect will have to be addressed in some way if the
budget is to be placed on a sustainable course.
� - Douglas Elmendorf, Director of U.S. Congressional Budget Office, 11/10/2009

An Observation from Ben Bernanke,
Current Chairman of the Federal Reserve
� A famous economist once said anything that can’t go on
forever will eventually stop, and this [government liabilities
from entitlement programs] will stop, but it might stop in a
very unpleasant way in terms of sharp cuts, a financial crisis,
high interest rates that stop growth, continued borrowing
from abroad. So, clearly we need to get control of this over
the medium term, and specifically we’re going to have to
look at entitlements because that’s a very big part of the
obligations of the federal government going forward.

Good News: While ‘Unfunded’ Liabilities Have Helped Bankrupt Companies,
USA Inc.'s Unfunded Liabilities are Not Legal Contracts
� Medicare / Social Security – While beneficiaries have a legal
entitlement to receive benefits as set forth under the Social Security Act,
Congress has the legal authority to change the levels of benefits
and/or the conditions under which they are paid. Congress’s
authority to modify provisions of the Social Security program was
affirmed in the 1960 Supreme Court decision in Flemming v. Nestor,
wherein the Court held that an individual does not have an accrued
“property right” in Social Security benefits. The Court has made clear in
subsequent decisions that the payment of Social Security taxes conveys
no contractual rights to Social Security benefits.
� Medicaid – Benefit levels & eligibility are determined jointly by Federal
and State governments. Federal funding is met through an appropriation
by Congress (and can be adjusted annually).

Good News: Mathematical Illustrations to Fix Social Security’s
Financial Problems Do Not Seem Drastic
In fact, when Social Security was nearing bankruptcy in 1983, a
combination of moderate reforms led to 25 consecutive years of
operating surpluses.
� Highlights of 1983 Social Security Reform
� 1) Raised full retirement age to 67 by 2027 (from 65)*
� 2) Reduced annual benefits by 5% (via a 6-month delay in cost-of-living
adjustment in 1983 & subsequent changes in benefit formulas and tax
schemes) .
� 3) Raised Social Security tax rates by 2.3% (via an advancement in
scheduled tax increase).
� 4) Made Social Security benefits (up to 50%) taxable income.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *For people born in 1937 or earlier, full retirement age (with 100% Social Security benefit) remained at 65. For people
born after 1960, full retirement age was raised to 67. For people born between 1937 and 1960, the full retirement age
progressively increases from 65 to 67. Source: Social Security Administration archive.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors –
Employer and Government Funding System Separates Consumers from
True Costs of Healthcare
� When one doesn’t pay directly and gets an expensive good / service for
free (or well below cost), one tends to consume more – it’s basic supply
and demand economics.
� Count up the subsidies:
� Medicaid: 47 million (24MM children / 12MM low-income adults / 7MM
disabled / 4MM elderly) Americans (15% of population) each received $6,872
in taxpayer funds, on average, for healthcare in 2008 through Medicaid. That
$6,872 equals ~19% of annual per-capita income for Americans.
� Medicare: 45 million elderly Americans (15% of population) averaged $7,991
per person for healthcare in 2008 ($4,875 for hospital care; $3,116 for medical
insurance and prescription drugs). That equals ~23% of annual per capita
income.
� Private Market: 157mm Americans with private health coverage (subsidized
by employers) in 2008 paid just 16% of the total premium cost themselves for
single coverage and 27% for family coverage. In effect, that represented taxfree
“earnings” of $3,951 for singles or $9,256 for families (not including the
tax savings on their personal premium contributions).

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—
Healthcare Providers Are Rewarded for Driving Revenue
• While striving to provide the best care possible, healthcare
providers tend to have financial / legal / societal incentives to
provide more care, all else equal.
• Reimbursement for providers is generally volume-based (e.g., more
procedures generate more revenue for care providers), though there
are efforts to increasingly focus on quality.
• Unlike car buyers, for example, who often disregard a dealer’s
maxed-out model and choose only the features that are important to
them and what they can afford, healthcare buyers tend to buy all the
“features” as: 1) buyers (patients in this case) are typically not
medical experts, so they defer to doctors / care providers for
decisions; and 2) buyers only bear a small portion of the costs as
someone else (employer or government) is paying for the features.

Poor Information & Lack of Price Transparency
Make it Harder for Consumers to “Comparison Shop”
Patients are at a healthcare information disadvantage in two respects 1 :
• Lack of transparency:
‣ It’s harder for consumers to compare prices of healthcare services from
different healthcare providers than in other consumer markets given the
complexity of healthcare market.
‣ With employer- / government-subsidized insurance, many patients are
‘locked in’ with their insurance plans that do not incentivize “shopping
around.”
• Knowledge gap:
‣ Unlike other markets where consumers tend to use their own information and
preferences, consumers depend more on the advice and guidance of
physicians or other healthcare suppliers.
‣ Unlike other “merchandise,” healthcare is literally of life-and-death
importance to consumers, making risk aversion – and price
insensitivity – higher. This price insensitivity is exacerbated because the
consumer, in effect, gets it at a discounted price anyway.

� Medpac summarizes the opportunities and issues succinctly.
� "Drivers of investment in IT include the promise of quality and efficiency gains.
Barriers include the cost and complexity of IT implementation, which often

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions
1) Cost-Sharing and/or
2) Reimbursement Reform and/or
3) Improving Cost & Quality Transparency and/or
4) Deploy Cost-Benefit Analysis for Medical
Technology Spending
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 306
Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions
1) Cost-Sharing
• Cost-sharing can help control demand for a portion of healthcare by creating
incentives for consumers to shop for most cost-effective treatments (although those
benefits would be somewhat mitigated by the skew in health spending toward high
users).
• Once again, a Math Problem: Consider a routine physician office visit in which a provider
suggests and / or patient requests various tests, procedures, etc.
• Patient #1 covered by a plan with a $20 co-pay (i.e., a flat fee regardless of the level or
intensity of care performed during the visit)
• Patient #2 covered by a plan with a 10% co-insurance for in-network care (i.e.,
responsible for 10% of the aggregate billed charges)
• Clearly, patient #2 will become more sensitive to necessity and cost of care beyond a
level of $200 of total healthcare services
• Note that deductibles drive similar dynamic as a co-pay: once the deductible is met, the
member has little or no “skin in the game”
• Only 14-18% of employer-sponsored health insurance plans use pro-rata cost sharing (i.e.
co-insurance in example #2 above). Most (77%) insurance plans only use a co-pay (in
example #1), which gives consumers little incentive to shop the most cost-effective treatment
path.

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors–Possible Solutions
2) Reimbursement Reform
Reimbursement reform could help shift drivers of payment from quantity of
care to quality of care. The following list provides a few options to consider.
• Bundled Payments: Providers get a fixed budget to treat an episode of care (i.e. a broken
hip). Exceeding the budget means providers absorb additional costs; staying under it lets
provider benefit from savings.
• Examples: PROMETHEUS Payment System 1 , Medicare Acute Care Episode
Demonstration 2
• Global payment system 3 (i.e., capitation): Providers are paid up-front to provide care that their
patient receives over a period, incentivizing them to manage costs and quality. This global
payment is adjusted periodically to reward accessible and high-quality care.
• Pay for performance 4 : Reimbursement for care providers varies, based on various quality and
efficiency measures such as discharge rate and readmission rate.
• Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs): Provider groups accept responsibility for the cost
and quality of care for a specific population of patients 5
• The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes regulations
supporting the creation of Accountable Care Organizations
• Other models often discussed to improve coordination / efficiency and reduce costs : 1)

3) Improving Cost & Quality Transparency
• Improving cost and quality transparency of healthcare services could help
doctors and patients make more informed decisions for each situation.
• Though enhancing competition and price transparency in healthcare is not
easy, 1 new models for encouraging “comparison shopping” are emerging:
• Castlight Health, a start-up financed by venture capitalists and the
Cleveland Clinic, is working to build a search engine for healthcare prices 2
• Other services beginning to publish price information: Thomson Reuters,
Change: healthcare, and health insurers (e.g., the Aetna Navigator) 2
• A 2007 study by Deloitte proposes a “Price Transparency Checklist for
States”:
• provide prices for services that matter to consumers
• make it easy to understand
• keep care providers, insurance & pharmaceutical companies engaged and informed
• provide price and quality measures
• keep expanding price transparency initiatives
• maintain methodological rigor
• promote access and use of price information
• evaluate impact and ROI

4) Deploy Cost-Benefit Analysis for Medical Technology Spending
� Deploying cost-benefit analysis for medical technology
spending can help ensure we are spending resources wisely.
� Directly measuring the impact of new technology on total
healthcare spending – and its true value – is very difficult 1
� The Kaiser Foundation outlines some of the more common policy
suggestions for dealing with this driver of costs:
� Cost-effectiveness analysis (i.e., comparative effectiveness)
� Rationing (unlikely to be adopted owing to political sensitivity),
regulation, budget-driven constraints (used by other countries
but generally not popular in the U.S.)
� Market-based rationing (consumer-driven healthcare, pay-forperformance,
information technology)

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Legal Factors—
“Defensive Medicine” Drives up Healthcare Spending
• Defensive Medicine consists of procedures or tests that a doctor
orders to avoid possible future malpractice lawsuits.
• The practice is prevalent among US physicians and is contributing
factor to healthcare spending. According to a survey of 824
physicians in 2005 1 :
• 93% said they had engaged in the practice of Defensive Medicine
• 59% said they often ordered more diagnostic tests than medically
necessary
• 52% said they referred patients to other specialists in unnecessary
circumstances
• 33% said they often prescribed more medications than medically
necessary

Tort Reform Could Reduce Incentives of Defensive Medicine
Ways to control costs from tort litigation without jeopardizing patient
health
The CBO listed a package of tort reform proposals (10/09):
� Cap of $250,000 on awards for noneconomic damages for malpractice
� Cap on awards for punitive damages of $500,000 or twice the award for
economic damages, whichever is greater
� Modification of the “collateral source” rule to allow evidence of income from
such sources as health and life insurance, workers’ compensation, and
automobile insurance and subtract it from jury awards
� A statute of limitations – one year for adults and three years for children –
from the date of discovery of an injury
� Replacement of joint-and-several liability with fair-share rule: Defendants
would be liable only for the percentage of a final award equal to their share of
responsibility

Restructure Medicare & Medicaid: Legal Factors—Possible Solution
Tort Reform Could Save USA Inc. $54 Billion Over Next 10 Years
• CBO estimates that a package of typical tort reform proposals could
reduce total US health spending by 0.5% annually:
� Direct savings: Roughly 0.2% of this reduction stems from lower national
premiums for medical malpractice insurance.
� Indirect savings: Another 0.3% stems from slightly lower utilization of
services related to defensive medicine.
• Over 10 years, CBO estimated tort reform could reduce net healthcare
spending by $54 billion:
• Spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program,
and Federal Employees Health Benefits could fall ~$41 billion over the
next decade (with the greatest savings in Medicare).
• Federal tax revenues could rise by ~$13 billion as lower health insurance
costs for employers could lead to higher take-home pay for employees
and therefore higher income taxes for USA Inc.

assessment, evidence-based medicine), or
Both clinical effectiveness and relative cost (cost-benefit analysis).
� Without rigorous data about comparative effectiveness, according to the CBO:
�
�
Treatment decisions often depend on anecdotal evidence, conjecture, and the
experience/judgment of involved physicians.
Treatments and types of care vary widely from one area of the country to another.
� To affect healthcare spending meaningfully, comparative effectiveness must alter
doctor and patient behavior, potentially through reimbursement scheme changes, the
CBO notes.
� Note that by law, Medicare is effectively precluded from considering costs when
making coverage decisions.

� Set global target for total federal health expenditures after 2020
(Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, exchange subsidies, employer health
exclusion), and review costs every two years. Keep federal health
expenditure growth to one percentage points above GDP growth.
� If costs have grown faster than targets (on average of previous 5 years),
require President to submit and Congress to consider reforms to lower
spending, such as:
� Increase premiums (or further increase cost-sharing)
� Overhaul the fee-for-service system
� Develop a premium support system for Medicare
� Add a robust public option and/or all-payer system in the exchange
� Further expand authority of the Independent Payment Advisory
Board (IPAB)*
Note: IPAB is a 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board established under PPACA with significant authority with respect to Medicare payment rates.
Beginning in 2014, in any year in which the Medicare per capita growth rate exceeded a target growth rate, the IPAB would be required to recommend
Medicare spending reductions. The recommendations would become law unless Congress passed an alternative proposal that achieved the same level of
budgetary savings. Source: National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, “The Moment of Truth: Report of the National Commission on Fiscal

At a High Level, With Focus on Improving Operating Efficiency,
USA Inc. Might Consider Ways to Do Things Like…
� Consider empowering an independent / 3 rd party auditor with expertise in government
operations around the world / corporate turnarounds to conduct a broad-ranging audit of
USA Inc.’s operations.
� Restore strong rules for budget process: Require annual budget resolutions and
reconciliation; PAYGO* to limit spending, enforce annual appropriations process consider
biennial budgeting.
� Consider giving the President ‘line-item’ veto / rescission authority.
� Empower commissions analogous to the military base closing panels to review and
consolidate government functions and agencies, as well as aid to State and local
governments.
� Seek flexibility to manage performance and terminate poor-performing Federal employees.
� Develop flexible / long-term compensation plans including bonus payments for Federal
employees when annual budget deficit reduction goals are met.
� Privatize government real estate and other assets with little use, expanding on current
efforts to trim $3 billion in government-owned real estate.
� Identify additional opportunities to increase public/private investment, management and
operations to drive innovation and investment in infrastructure

Review Wages: A Comprehensive / Independent
Review of Federal Wages & Benefits System May Be Worthwhile
� Analysis of existing data on federal wages & benefits is controversial.
� USA Today and the Cato Institute examined simple averages of federal (excluding military)
wages & benefits vs. private sector using Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data and
concluded that federal wages & benefits are ~100% higher than private industry – wages
are 58% higher while benefits are 3x higher. 1 (March 2010, updated in August 2010)
� The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) responded that gross average comparisons are ‘unfair and
untrue.’ And when one holds education and age constant, federal employees earn slightly
less than those in the private sector on average, although the difference is not statistically
significant. 2 (March 2010)
� The Heritage Foundation, in response to OPM and OMB’s comments, released a statistical
analysis based on BEA data, and claimed that adjusting for variables such as age,
education, marital status, race, gender, size of the metropolitan area, and several others,
federal wages & benefits are 31% higher than private industry for occupations in both
government and private sector. 3 (July 2010)

Review Wages: A Turnaround Expert Would Drill Down on Compensation
Differences Between Public & Private Sectors
� In the absence of reliable, generally accepted adjustment factors,
USA Inc. needs a comprehensive 3 rd -party review of its compensation
practices.
� Most businesses constantly review their compensation practices; these
reviews typically intensify when the financials of the core business erode.
� Considerations include compensation for comparable jobs, uniqueness
of skill sets and education required for particular roles, productivity,
hours worked, regional cost of living, job security, years of service, and
financial health of the business unit.

Review Pension: Pension Plan Definitions / Characteristics
� “Guaranteed” Pension Plan – Retirees receive predetermined monthly
retirement benefits from employers despite the funding status /
investment returns of their pension funds. Also known as defined benefit
pension plan.
� Defined Contribution Pension Plan – Retirees contribute specified
amounts to their pension funds and receive variable monthly retirement
benefits depending on investment returns. Examples include Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans.

Local Outsourcing/Consolidation: Improve Efficiency of Public Services
Through Automation / Scale / Flexibility
1. Automation – Government agencies cannot afford to perform manual
routine-based processes that can be replaced more efficiently by
technology.
2. Scale – Consolidation of non-core processes across agencies or
outsource non-core processes to local companies can deliver scale
efficiencies.
3. Flexibility – Outsourced labor enables temporary employment in
situations where hiring full-time workers would be costly and
unnecessary.

It’s Easy to Gripe About USA Inc.’s High Expense Levels…
That Said, High Expenses Could be Covered by High Revenue
� There are two primary drivers of USA Inc.’s revenue: 1) GDP growth and 2)
related tax levies on consumers and businesses.
� To bring its income statement mechanically to break-even for 2009 (excluding onetime
charges), USA Inc. would have needed to raise individual income tax rates by
~2x across-the-board to an average of ~26-30% (from ~13%) of gross income. 1 This
certainly seems draconian. And a tax increase of this nature would surely have a
significant negative impact on USA’s GDP growth as consumers would have far less
disposable income to buy goods and services.
� This brings us to a key element of USA’s financial challenges – the need to drive
economic (GDP) AND related job growth. This is not easy. A material portion of GDP
growth over the past few decades was driven by rising consumption aided by rising
leverage and we have now entered a period of de-leveraging.
� Stronger economic growth would be hugely beneficial for USA Inc.’s revenues. But
the legacy of the financial crisis – severe housing imbalances and the need to
complete the long process of writing off private mortgage debt – means that the US
recovery will probably remain slow for at least several years. The silver lining: A
booming global economy should provide a modest lift to US growth.
www.kpcb.com
Note: 1) USA Inc.’s F2009 revenue shortfall was $997B (excluding one-time discretionary spending items). F2009 total
income tax receipts from individuals were $915B. As a result, if one were to raise individual income tax rates alone to achieve
financial break-even, one would have to more than double individual income tax rates across-the-board.

� CBO analysis shows that for every 0.1 percentage point (pps) increase in real GDP annual
growth rate above CBO’s baseline estimate for F2011-F2020E, USA Inc.’s revenue (driven
by taxes) could be $247 billion higher, spending could be $41 billion lower (driven by
reduced welfare spending) and the budget deficit could be reduced by $288 billion, or 5%.

Beginning in 2007, Wealth Destruction + High Unemployment Forced Consumers
to Save Again, Potentially Reducing Short-Term Demand for Goods & Services
3% average annual GDP growth (1981 - 2007) was helped as the average USA consumer:
1) Increased personal consumption as percent of GDP to 71% from 62%;
2) Decreased personal savings rate to 2% of disposable income from 11%;
Beginning in 2007, things changed as:
1) The average US consumer experienced a material decline in the value of his / her largest
investment assets (real estate and equities) from 2007 to 2009 when peak-to-trough
valuations for USA residential real estate declined 30% and the S&P 500 declined 56%;
2) Unemployment rose to 10% in 2009 / 2010 from 30-year trough of 4% in 1999, creating
uncertainty regarding future personal income levels;
3) Personal savings rate increased to 6% in 2009 / 2010 of disposable income from 2% in 2007,
as uncertainty grows and appetite for consumption ebbs;
All in, the key driver of US GDP growth – the US consumer’s ability to spend – is severely
constrained in the short term as he / she aims to rebuild savings and contain
spending. This raises the question – ‘How fast can US GDP grow annually over the
next ten years?’ Determining ways to drive GDP (and related job growth) is crucial…

Economic Policy–Short-Term vs. Long-Term
• Economic theory + experience of the Great Depression suggest
government can use fiscal policy (increase direct spending +
investment) to offset near-term shortfalls in private demand.
• In the long term, USA Inc. cannot sustain higher levels of direct
spending / investment without crowding out private consumption /
investment.
• Therefore, USA Inc. should prioritize and allocate available
resources to stimulate growth in productivity + employment, which
drive long-term GDP growth.

� Investments in Technology / Infrastructure / Education Boost Productivity.
� Newer technology improves efficiency of communication and lowers costs of
providing goods and services.
� Better infrastructure reduces transportation costs for input and output materials
� Better education improves general labor quality and enables specialization for
more efficiency.
� Removing Restrictions / Uncertainties in Various Regulations Can
Stimulate Private Employment.
� Immigration does not reduce employment opportunities for US-born workers,
per Federal Reserve study in 8/10.
� Removing tax / regulatory uncertainty could help create hiring incentives for

For GDP Growth & Job Creation, It’s Key for Private Industry to Remain
Incentivized to Invest in R&D
� As we contemplate our future, we must accept the fact that many of the assumptions under
which business operated for the past 50 years no longer hold true…If we are committed to
investing in ideas to improve – not just maintain – what we have and what we know, the United
States will do more than just recover from this recession. We will emerge, once again, as a
competitive, global powerhouse…Innovation…accrues to countries in proportion to the quality
and rigor of their educational systems…The future of every nation will be shaped by new ideas
and creativity. These are the engines of future prosperity.
– Paul Otellini, CEO, Intel Corporation, 2/10/09
� Government targeted and ‘blue sky’ investment in technology (and defense) has led to crucial
technology inventions for America – such as ARPANET / Internet (1970s) and Global
Positioning System (1980s)..., which, on a net basis, have created jobs, wealth and related tax
revenue.
� Government investment in technology remains important, but, perhaps more important,
government must help incentivize private industry (via tax policies such as allowing companies
to repatriate overseas cash at lower tax rates 1 and other tools) to invest in domestic research &
development and to create jobs…and create a stable environment in which to operate.

Increase Employment: Structural Problems in USA Labor Force High
Healthcare Costs + Skills Mismatch + Labor Immobility
� Healthcare costs may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� Healthcare benefits = 8% of average total employee compensation; grew at 6.9%
CAGR from 1998 to 2008 compared with 4.5% CAGR in salaries.
� Healthcare benefits are fixed costs as they are paid on an annual per-worker basis
and do not vary with hours worked.
� As employers try to lower fixed costs to right-size to reduced revenue levels,
layoffs are the only way to reduce fixed healthcare costs.
� Skills mismatch may be a barrier to hiring for employers
� A large portion of the long-term unemployed may lack requisite skills.
� 14% of firms reported difficulty filling positions due to the lack of suitable talent, per
5/10 Manpower Research survey.
� Labor immobility resulting from the housing bust may be a barrier to hiring
� One in four homeowners are “trapped” because they owe more than their houses
are worth, so they cannot move to take new jobs – until they sell or walk away.

� McKinsey conducted a study in 2010 that compares the USA with other
countries on 20 attributes related to economic fundamentals, business
climate, human capital and infrastructure. McKinsey compared current
status vs. status in 2000.
� We augmented the McKinsey study with 9 additional attributes across those
aforementioned areas as well as government spending metrics.
� Through this study, we found that America, relative to other countries, improved
on none of the 29 attributes, remained the same on 9 attributes (including
GDP per capita, public debt as % of GDP, public spending on healthcare, public
spending on education, growth in local innovation clusters, population &
demographic profile, retention of foreign-born talents, total healthcare spending
and cost-adjusted labor productivity) and deteriorated on 20 (including trade
surplus, national spending on R&D, industrial production, corporate tax rate,
business environment, FDI, tax incentives for R&D, number of patent
applications, availability of high-quality labor, higher education penetration,
telecom & transportation infrastructure, etc.).

Pros + Cons of Tax Rate Hikes
� A more progressive income tax system could lower tax burden from
potential subsidy cuts and carbon taxes on the low-income population.
� Addressing income inequality may enhance perceived fairness – and
political chances – of comprehensive deficit measures.
� Across-the-board tax rate increases would hurt nearly everyone, but
especially lower-income taxpayers.
� Rate increases on upper brackets usually spur tax avoidance, and
revenues often fall short of targets.
� Rate increases, which discourage savings, amplify distortions in the
economy from tax subsidies, exclusions and tax expenditures, all of
which encourage consumption.

Mathematical Illustrations*
� 1) To eliminate F2010 deficits by increasing individual / corporate / payroll tax
rates across-the-board would require +12 percentage points of tax rate increase
(raising $1.4 trillion) – and would likely damage economic growth? or
� 2) To eliminate primary budget deficit** by F2019E by increasing top two tiers of
income tax rates would require moving marginal rates to 72% / 77% from 33% /
35% – also likely to damage growth and encourage tax avoidance? or
� 3) Broadening tax base could require reducing ‘tax expenditures’ and subsidies,
e.g., limiting deductions and subsidies for housing & healthcare?
Policy Options
Illustrating the Revenue Tradeoffs –
Changing Tax Rates vs. Broadening the Tax Base
� 1) A combination of somewhat higher rates and a broader tax base? and/or
� 2) Changing taxation of individual income to encourage saving / investment
rather than consumption (perhaps a value-added tax and/or carbon tax)? and/or
� 3) Changing taxation of corporate income to reflect global competition?

Changing USA Inc.’s Tax System Could Help
Rebalance the Economy & Reallocate Resources
� Though there would be adjustment costs, reducing subsidies and ‘tax
expenditures’ could broaden the tax base and collect more revenue, while
allowing income tax rates to stay low or go lower.
� The current system favors consumption, penalizes saving; a tax based on
consumption (or “value added”) could offset some of that penalty, though there
are risks and drawbacks.
� Subsidies create incentives to consume more health insurance and housing –
both account for 20% of GDP, vs. 11% in 1965 1 – and take resources from other
sectors like education, technology, infrastructure.
� A worldwide corporate tax system with a lower tax rate could reduce incentives
for companies to keep income offshore.
� A carbon tax could raise some additional revenue to reduce the deficit, while
encouraging sustainable economic development.

Expenditures
Some tax expenditures favor
consumption...
Such as tax exemption on
employer contributions to health
insurance & deductibility of
mortgage interest on owneroccupied
homes…
…But others favor saving,
investment, and growth
Such as tax exemptions /
deductibility on capital gains /
dividends / pension contributions
& savings / accelerated
depreciation of equipment…
Note: *Each foregone revenue estimate assumes all other parts of the Tax Code remain unchanged during F2009. Aggregate tax subsidies presented here is simply
the sum of individual estimates. In reality, the aggregate estimate would be different if tax subsidies were changed simultaneously because of potential interactions
among provisions.

Raising Revenue by Reducing Tax Expenditures & Subsidies: Examples
• Reducing the biggest tax expenditures and subsidies could net $1.7
trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, per CBO and the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget:
– Reduce the tax exclusion for health insurance or replace with a credit
– Cap the deduction for state and local taxes
– Gradually reduce the mortgage interest deduction or change to a credit
– Limit the tax benefit of other deductions, e.g., charitable contributions
• Some subsidies encourage saving or investment…and cutting them
could mean short-term revenue gain but a net loss over time.
Examples:
– Favorable taxation of capital gains, dividends, and pension contributions
– Exclude investment income from life insurance and annuities in taxable income
– Accelerated depreciation or expensing of capital equipment outlays

Tax Policy Options From Report of the National Commission on
Fiscal Responsibility and Reform
� Consolidate the tax code into three individual income rates (15% / 25% / 35%) and one
corporate income rate (26%)
� Eliminate the complex tax codes such as AMT 1 , PEP 2 , and Pease 3
� Triple standard deduction to $30,000 ($15,000 for individuals)
� Repeal state & local tax deduction and miscellaneous itemized deductions
� Limit mortgage deduction to exclude 2 nd residences, home equity loans, and mortgages
over $500,000
� Limit charitable deduction with floor at 2% of Adjusted Gross Income
� Cap income tax exclusion for employer-provided healthcare at the amount of the actuarial
value of Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) standard option
� Permanently extend the research tax credit for businesses
� Eliminate and modify several business tax expenditures (domestic production deduction /
LIFO 4 method of accounting / energy tax preferences for the oil and gas industry /
depreciation rules)
� International tax reform including a territorial system 5
Note: 1) AMT is the Alternative Minimum Tax; 2) PEP is Personal Exemption Phase-out designed to eliminate personal income exemptions for high earners; 3) Pease is a similar
phase-out, but instead of applying to personal exemption, it applies to most of the itemized deductions of a taxpayer’s claims (mortgage interest, charitable gifts, state & local taxes
paid, etc.); Pease is named after Representative Donald Pease (D-OH) who pushed for its enactment in 1990. 4) LIFO is ‘Last In, First Out’ which tend to reduce corporations’ income
taxes in times of inflation. 5) A territorial tax system is a tax system that taxes only income that is created within the borders of a specific territory (usually a country). Source: National
Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, “The Moment of Truth: Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform,” 12/1/10. Note that the Report also
identified two other scenarios called the ‘The Zero Plan’ which eliminates all tax expenditures and ‘Tax Reform Trigger’ which forces Congress to undertake comprehensive tax reform
by 2012 by raising taxes for each year Congress fails to act.

To Take a Step Back…
� We Asked the Question
�
How would public shareholders view USA Inc.?
� What Have We Found?
�
USA Inc.’s finances – short-term and long-term, income statement
and balance sheet – are challenged. Management’s policies have
created incentives to invest in healthcare, housing, and current
consumption rather than in productive capital, education, and
technology – the tools needed to compete in the global marketplace.
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | Consequences of Inaction 414
Consequences of Inaction – Investor Perspective
� Short Term, No Problem Yet
�
Global bond investors, in part, have looked past USA Inc.’s
deteriorating financials because growth, inflation, and Fed
purchases matter more, and because income statements and
balance sheets of many other developed countries (such as
Greece / Spain / Portugal / Ireland) are worse.
� Long Term, Consequences of Inaction Could Be Severe
�
If USA Inc.’s “managers” and “board” continue to ignore rising
unfunded entitlement spending, investors could eventually demand
a higher return to lend money to USA Inc. – leading to rising bond
yields / higher borrowing costs for USA Inc. At some point, USA
Inc.’s currency could also weaken significantly.

However, in Longer Term, Credit Rating Agencies Have Begun to Worry
About USA Inc.’s Debt Affordability
� On balance, we believe that the ratings of all large Aaa governments [including
USA Inc.] remain well positioned, although their ‘distance-to-downgrade’ has
in all cases substantially diminished…Growth alone will not resolve an
increasingly complicated debt equation…Preserving debt affordability at levels
consistent with Aaa ratings will invariably require fiscal adjustments of a
magnitude that, in some cases, will test social cohesion. 1

� Rising Unfunded Entitlement Spending = Often a Long-Term Driver of Debt
Crisis
� Countries such as Greece / Argentina and cities such as New York all nearly
brought down by unfunded entitlement spending.
� Financial Crisis / Economic Downturn = Often the Short-Term Trigger of
Debt Crisis
� All cases had similar short-term triggers.
� External Forces = Often Key Stakeholders in Crisis & Driving Ensuing
Changes
� Most sovereign credit crises + ensuing reforms were driven by loss of
confidence of international bond investors.
� New York City’s near default was driven by demands from bond holders +
refusal of bailout from federal government.

While High Government Debt Levels Could Hasten Economic Recovery
Post Recession, There Are Many Long-Term Negative Consequences
� Crowding Out Investment � Lower Output & Income
� A growing portion of people’s savings would be diverted to purchase
government debt rather than toward investment in productive capital goods.
� Higher Interest Payments � Higher Tax Rates & Lower Output & Income
� Government may be forced to raise marginal tax rates and / or reduce
spending on other programs to meet interest payments.
� Reduced Ability to Borrow � Less Policy Flexibility
� In case of economic downturns or international crises, government may not be
able to raise substantially more debt.
� Increased Chance of Sudden Fiscal Crisis � Social / Economic Disruption
� Investors may lose confidence in government’s ability to repay debt & interest
without causing inflation.

General Motors –
Entitlement Spending Became Too Onerous for this Great American Company
1908 – Founded in Flint, Michigan to manufacture automobiles
1954 – Shipped 50 millionth automobile
1988 – Free cash flow peaked at $6.3B
1999 – Reached a peak market capitalization of $61B
2006 – Revenue peaked at $207B
2009 – Filed for bankruptcy
� Why did GM file for bankruptcy?
Products became increasingly uncompetitive. In addition, pension plans to
support 650,000 retirees and their dependents (compared with 80,000 active
employees in N. America as of 2010) rose to 4.8% of GM’s annual expenses and
$4,679 in annual pension payments per worker to former workers.

…Good News for GM Is It Has ‘Taken Its Medicine’ and Has
Begun to Implement a Successful Turnaround
Basic Framework of GM Turnaround:
� Focus on Expenses
� Eliminated some of the legacy entitlements - swapped employee
healthcare for equity ownership.
� Significantly changed operating efficiency - took out costs so that GM
was able to operate at breakeven at bottom of the cycle and turn cash
flow positive during other parts of its business cycle.
� Focus on Revenue
� Changed business model to move away from lowering cost to
improving vehicle quality, engineering and styling.

Highlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials
� Summary – USA Inc. has challenges.
� Cash Flow – While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative
for 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative
cash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,' many
of whom are people with few alternatives.
� Balance Sheet – Net worth is negative and deteriorating.
� Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities – Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily
unfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt
on the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits
(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA
Inc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance
sheet debt.
� Conclusion – Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by
shareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and
entrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,
but both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,
and sacrifice.
Note: USA federal fiscal year ends in September; Cash flow = total revenue – total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes
unfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. Source: cash flow per
White House Office of Management and Budget; net worth per Dept. of Treasury, “2010 Financial Report of the U.S.

Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials…
� To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged
�
Excluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net
margin 1 over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or
-$11,000 per household), and net worth 2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).
� The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges
�
�
�
Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,
created various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have
been made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,
however, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate – and getting worse.
Entitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement
spending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by
more than $1 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges
only compound the problem.
Some consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.’s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and
streamlining could yield savings – $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study 3 – perhaps without
damaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although
defense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to
2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and
1930.
www.kpcb.com
Note: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national
parks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as
Social Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government”; 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew
Leatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)
USA Inc. | Summary 439
…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials…
� Medicare and Medicaid, largely underfunded (based on ‘dedicated’ revenue) and
growing rapidly, accounted for 21% (or $724B) of USA Inc.’s total expenses in F2010,
up from 5% forty years ago
� Together, these two programs represent 35% of all (annual) US healthcare spending; Federal Medicaid
spending has doubled in real terms over the last decade, to $273 billion annually.
� Total government healthcare spending consumes 8.2% of GDP compared with just
1.3% fifty years ago; the new health reform law could increase USA Inc.’s budget
deficit
� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs
continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).
� Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. The
future, not so bright
� Demographic trends have exacerbated the funding problems for Medicare and Social Security – of the
102 million increased enrollment between 1965 and 2009, 42 million (or 41%) is due to an aging
population. With a 26% longer life expectancy but a 3% increase in retirement age (since Social
Security was created in 1935), deficits from Social Security could add $11.6 trillion (or 140%) to the
public debt by 2037E, per Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc. | Summary 440
…Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials
� If entitlement programs are not reformed, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go from bad to
worse
� Public debt has doubled over the last 30 years, to 62% of GDP. This ratio is expected to surpass the
90% threshold* – above which real GDP growth could slow considerably – in 10 years and could near
150% of GDP in 20 years if entitlement expenses continue to soar, per CBO.
� As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs
continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).
� The turning point: Within 15 years (by 2025), entitlements plus net interest expenses
will absorb all – yes, all – of USA Inc.’s annual revenue, per CBO
� That would require USA Inc. to borrow funds for defense, education, infrastructure, and R&D spending,
which today account for 32% of USA Inc. spending (excluding one-time items), down dramatically from
69% forty years ago.
� It’s notable that CBO’s projection from 10 years ago (in 1999) showed Federal revenue sufficient to
support entitlement spending + interest payments until 2060E – 35 years later than current projection.
www.kpcb.com
Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the
relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP.
Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We note that while
Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European
countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.

How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?...
� Key focus areas would likely be reducing USA Inc.’s budget deficit and improving /
restructuring the ‘business model’…
� One would likely drill down on USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers, then develop a
basic analytical framework for ‘normal’ revenue / expenses, then compare options.
�
�
Looking at history…
Annual growth in revenue of 3% has been roughly in line with GDP for 40 years* while
corporate income taxes grew at 2%. Social insurance taxes (for Social Security / Medicare)
grew 5% annually and now represent 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965.
Annual growth in expenses of 3% has been roughly in line with revenue, but entitlements are
up 5% per annum - and now absorb 51% of all USA Inc.’s expense - more than twice their
share in 1965; defense and other discretionary spending growth has been just 1-2%.
�
One might ask…
Should expense and revenue levels be re-thought and re-set so USA Inc. operates near
break-even and expense growth (with needed puts and takes) matches GDP growth, thus
adopting a ‘don’t spend more than you earn’ approach to managing USA Inc.’s financials?
Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent
40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969, so
www.kpcb.com
many metrics (like individual income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.
USA Inc. | Summary 442
…How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?
One might consider…
�
�
�
Options for reducing expenses by focusing on entitlement reform and operating efficiency
�
�
Formula changes could help Social Security’s underfunding, but look too draconian for Medicare/Medicaid;
the underlying healthcare cost dilemma requires business process restructuring and realigned incentives.
Resuming the 20-year trend line for lower Federal civilian employment, plus more flexible compensation
systems and selective local outsourcing, could help streamline USA Inc.’s operations.
Options for increasing revenue by focusing on driving long-term GDP growth and changing tax
policies
� USA Inc. should examine ways to invest in growth that provides a high return (ROI) via new investment in
technology, education, and infrastructure and could stimulate productivity gains and employment growth.
�
Reducing tax subsidies (like exemptions on mortgage interest payments or healthcare benefits) and
changing the tax system in other ways could increase USA Inc.’s revenue without raising income taxes to
punitive – and self-defeating – levels. Such tax policy changes could help re-balance USA’s economy
between consumption and savings and re-orient business lines towards investment-led growth, though
there are potential risks and drawbacks.
History suggests the long-term consequences of inaction could be severe
�
USA Inc. has many assets, but it must start addressing its spending/debt challenges now.

Sizing Costs Related to USA Inc.’s Key Financial Challenges
& Potential AND / OR Solutions
� To create frameworks for discussion, the next slide summarizes USA Inc.’s various
financial challenges and the projected future cost of each main expense driver.
� The estimated future cost is calculated as the net present value of expected
‘dedicated’ future income (such as payroll taxes) minus expected future expenses
(such as benefits paid) over the next 75 years.
� Then we ask the question: ‘What can we do to solve these financial challenges?’
�
The potential solutions include a range of simple mathematical illustrations (such as
changing program characteristics or increasing tax rates) and/or program-specific
policy solutions proposed or considered by lawmakers and agencies like the CBO
(such as indexing Social Security initial benefits to growth in cost of living).
� These mathematical illustrations are only a mechanical answer to key financial
challenges and not realistic solutions. In reality, a combination of detailed policy
changes will likely be required to bridge the future funding gap.

Current Observations About America…
• On many fronts, USA Inc. is in great shape, but it has one big problem –
USA Inc. spends too much and, in effect, is maxing out its credit card. USA
Inc. must address the problem.
• In 2009, 64% of America’s revenue went to Social Security, Medicare &
Medicaid, compared with 31% in 1980 and 20% in 1970.
• Using current projections, 100% of America’s revenue in 2025 will go to Social
Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Net Interest Expense.
• This raises the question, ‘How will America pay for the likes of education,
national defense, homeland security, infrastructure improvement, R&D, law
enforcement, postal service, etc.?’
• USA Inc.’s fundamental tradeoff is that it must balance its FUTURE
(education) with its PRESENT (national defense & homeland security) and
its PAST (Social Security & Medicare & Medicaid).

� We Focus on Public Debt Levels
�
�
�
Public debt is the base for calculating net interest payments.
Gross debt level could be misleading (to take an extreme example, simply eliminating all
trust funds without changing promised benefits for the associated programs would
dramatically reduce gross debt from 94% of GDP to 62% of GDP without improving longterm
fiscal outlook at all*).
In the future, when intragovernmental debt + net liability of GSEs begin demanding
repayments, it is likely financed via material increases in public debt levels.

Glossary
Accountable Care Organization (ACO) -
A health system model with the ability to
provide, and manage with patients, the
continuum of care across different
institutional settings, including at least
ambulatory (outpatient) and inpatient
hospital care and possibly post acute care.
ACOs have the capability of planning
budgets and resources and are of sufficient
size to support comprehensive, valid, and
reliable performance measurement. The
ACO model is one of the latest designs for
managing healthcare costs and especially
Medicare costs, and is gaining traction
among policymakers desperate to control
costs and boost quality in healthcare.
Accrual accounting - A system of
accounting in which revenues are recorded
when they are earned and outlays are
recorded when goods are received or
services are performed, even though the
actual receipt of revenues and payment for
goods or services may occur, in whole or in
part, at a different time. Compare with cash
accounting.
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) - All income
that is subject to taxation under the
individual income tax after "above-the-line"
deductions for such things as alimony
payments and certain contributions to
individual retirement accounts. Personal
exemptions and the standard or itemized
deductions are subtracted from AGI to
determine taxable income
Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) - A tax
intended to limit the extent to which higherincome
people can reduce their tax liability
(the amount they owe) through the use of
preferences in the tax code. Taxpayers
subject to the AMT are required to
recalculate their tax liability on the basis of a
more limited set of exemptions, deductions,
and tax credits than would normally apply.
The amount by which a taxpayer’s AMT
calculation exceeds his or her regular tax
calculation is that person’s AMT liability.
American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (ARRA) - This act provided
appropriations for several federal programs
and increased or extended some benefits
payable under Medicaid, unemployment
compensation, and nutrition assistance,
among others. ARRA also reduced
individual and corporate income taxes and
made other changes to tax laws.
Asset-Backed Security - Security backed
by real estate or another type of asset; a
claim on an income flow, such as expected
interest payments on loans, payments on
leases, royalty payments, or receivables; a
claim on the principal of a loan; or a claim on
the expected appreciation of an asset.
Automatic Stabilizers - Taxes that
decrease and expenditures that increase
when the economy goes into a recession
(and vice-versa when the economy booms)
without requiring any action on the part of
the government. Stabilizers tend to reduce
the depth of recessions and dampen booms.

Bundled Payment (Healthcare) - Also
known as episode-based payment, defined
as the reimbursement of health care
providers (such as hospitals and physicians)
on the basis of expected costs for clinicallydefined
episodes of care. It has been
described as "a middle ground" between
fee-for-service reimbursement (in which
providers are paid for each service rendered
to a patient) and capitation (in which
providers are paid a "lump sum" per patient
regardless of how many services the patient
receives).
Business Cycle - Fluctuations in overall
business activity accompanied by swings in
the unemployment rate, interest rates, and
corporate profits. Over a business cycle, real
(inflation-adjusted) activity rises to a peak
(its highest level during the cycle) and then
falls until it reaches a trough (its lowest level
following the peak), whereupon it starts to
rise again, defining a new cycle. Business
cycles are irregular, varying in frequency,
magnitude, and duration. (NBER) See real
and unemployment rate.
Cash Accounting - A system of accounting
in which revenues are recorded when they
are actually received and outlays are
recorded when payment is made. Compare
with accrual accounting.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) – US federal agency which
administers Medicare, Medicaid, and the
Children's Health Insurance Program.
Copayment – A flat amount paid out of
pocket per medical service, e.g., $5 per
office visit.
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) – A
non-partisan federal agency within the
legislative branch of the U.S. government,
charged with reviewing congressional
budgets and other legislative initiatives with
budgetary implications.
Conservatorship - The legal process by
which an external entity (in the case of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal
government) establishes control and
oversight of a company to put it in a sound
and solvent condition.
Consumption - In principle, the value of
goods and services purchased and used up
during a given period by households and
governments. In practice, the Bureau of
Economic Analysis counts purchases of
many long-lasting goods (such as cars and
clothes) as consumption even though the
goods are not used up. Consumption by
households alone is also called consumer
spending. See national income and product
accounts.
Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) - An
annual increase in Social Security and other
entitlement payments to reflect price
inflation.
Current-Account Balance - A summary
measure of a country’s current transactions
with the rest of the world, including net
exports, net unilateral transfers, and net
factor income (primarily the capital income
from foreign property received by residents
of a country offset by the capital income from
property in that country flowing to residents
of foreign countries).
Cyclical Deficit or Surplus - The part of the
federal budget deficit or surplus that results
from the business cycle. The cyclical
component reflects the way in which the
deficit or surplus automatically increases or
decreases during economic expansions or
recessions.
Cyclically Adjusted Budget Deficit or
Surplus - The federal budget deficit or
surplus that would occur under current law if
the influence of the business cycle was
removed—that is, if the economy operated
at potential gross domestic product.

xx
Debt - In the case of the federal
government, the total value of outstanding
bills, notes, bonds, and other debt
instruments issued by the Treasury and
other federal agencies. That debt is referred
to as federal debt or gross debt. It has two
components - debt held by the public (
federal debt held by nonfederal investors,
including the Federal Reserve System) and
debt held by government accounts (federal
debt held by federal government trust funds,
deposit insurance funds, and other federal
accounts). Debt subject to limit is federal
debt that is subject to a statutory limit on the
total amount issued. The limit applies to
gross federal debt except for a small portion
of the debt issued by the Treasury and the
small amount of debt issued by other federal
agencies (primarily the Tennessee Valley
Authority and the Postal Service).
Deductible (Medical Insurance) - A fixed
amount, usually expressed in dollars in the
form of an annual fee, that the beneficiary of
a health insurance plan must pay directly to
the health care provider before a health
insurance plan begins to pay for any costs
associated with the insured medical service.
Deficit - The amount by which the federal
government’s total outlays exceed its total
revenues in a given period, typically a fiscal
year. The primary deficit is that total deficit
excluding net interest.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan – Retirees
receive predetermined monthly retirement
benefits from employers despite the funding
status / investment returns of their pension
funds.
Defined Contribution Pension Plan –
Retirees contribute specified amount to their
pension funds and receive variable monthly
retirement benefits depending on investment
returns. Examples include Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)
plans.
Disposable Personal Income - Personal
income—the income that people receive,
including transfer payments—minus the
taxes and fees that people pay to
governments.
Economic Stimulus - Federal fiscal or
monetary policies aimed at promoting
economic activity, used primarily during
recessions. Such policies include reductions
in taxes, increases in federal spending,
reductions in interest rates, and other
support for financial markets and institutions.
Entitlement - A legal obligation of the
federal government to make payments to a
person, group of people, business, unit of
government, or similar entity that meets the
eligibility criteria set in law and for which the
budget authority is not provided in advance
in an appropriation act. Spending for
entitlement programs is controlled through
those programs’ eligibility criteria and benefit
or payment rules. The best-known
entitlements are the government’s major
benefit programs, such as Social Security
and Medicare.
Excise Tax - A tax levied on the purchase of
a specific type of good or service, such as
tobacco products or air transportation
services.
Federal Poverty Level (FPL) - Income
amounts set each February by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services
used to determine an individual's or family's
eligibility for various public programs,
including Medicaid and the State Children's
Health Insurance Program.
Federal Reserve System - The central
bank of the United States. The Federal
Reserve is responsible for setting the
nation’s monetary policy and overseeing
credit conditions. See central bank and
monetary policy.

xxi
Fiscal Policy - The government’s tax and
spending policies, which influence the
amount and maturity of government debt as
well as the level, composition, and
distribution of national output and income.
See debt.
Fiscal Year - A yearly accounting period.
The federal government’s fiscal year begins
October 1 and ends September 30. Fiscal
years are designated by the calendar years
in which they end—for example, fiscal year
2011 will begin on October 1, 2010, and end
on September 30, 2011.
GDP price index - A summary measure of
the prices of all goods and services that
make up gross domestic product. The
change in the GDP price index is used as a
measure of inflation in the overall economy.
General Fund - One category of federal
funds in the government’s accounting
structure. The general fund records all
revenues and offsetting receipts not
earmarked by law for a specific purpose and
all spending financed by those revenues and
receipts.
Government-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE)
- A financial institution created by federal
law, generally though a federal charter, to
carry out activities such as increasing credit
availability for borrowers, reducing borrowing
costs, or enhancing liquidity in particular
sectors of the economy, notably agriculture
and housing. Two housing GSEs (Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac) were taken into
federal conservatorship in 2008.
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) - A
managed care plan that combines the
function of insurer and provider to give
members comprehensive health care from a
network of affiliated providers. Enrollees
typically pay limited copayments and are
usually required to select a primary care
physician through whom all care must be
coordinated. HMOs generally will not
reimburse all costs for services obtained
from a non-network provider or without a
primary care physician's referral. HMOs
often emphasize prevention and careful
assessment of medical necessity.
Independent Payment Advisory Board
(IPAB) - A 15-member Independent
Payment Advisory Board created under
PPACA with significant authority with
respect to Medicare payment rates.
Beginning in 2014, in any year in which the
Medicare per capita growth rate exceeded a
target growth rate, the IPAB would be
required to recommend Medicare spending
reductions. The recommendations would
become law unless Congress passed an
alternative proposal that achieved the same
level of budgetary savings. Subject to some
limitations—hospitals, for example, would be
exempt until 2020—the IPAB could
recommend spending reductions affecting
Medicare providers and suppliers, as well as
Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug
Plans.
Labor Force - The number of people age 16
or older in the civilian non-institutional
population who have jobs or who are
available for work and are actively seeking
jobs. (The civilian non-institutional
population excludes members of the armed
forces on active duty and people in penal or
mental institutions or in homes for the elderly
or infirm.) The labor force participation rate
is the labor force as a percentage of the
civilian non-institutional population age 16 or
older.
Marginal Tax Rate - The tax rate that would
apply to an additional dollar of a taxpayer’s
income. Compare with effective tax rate and
statutory tax rate.
www.kpcb.com
USA Inc.
xxii
Medicaid - Public health insurance program
that provides coverage for low-income
persons for acute and long-term care. It is
financed jointly by state and federal funds
(the federal government pays at least 50
percent of the total cost in each state) and is
administered by states within broad federal
guidelines.
Medicare - Federal health insurance
program for virtually all persons age 65 and
older, and permanently disabled persons
under age 65, who qualify by receiving
Social Security Disability Insurance.
Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs) -
Securities issued by financial institutions to
investors with the payments of interest and
principal backed by the payments on a
package of mortgages. MBSs are structured
by their sponsors to create multiple classes
of claims, or tranches, of different seniority,
based on the cash flows from the underlying
mortgages. Investors holding securities in
the safest, or most senior, tranche stand first
in line to receive payments from borrowers
and require the lowest contractual interest
rate of all the tranches. Investors holding the
least senior securities stand last in line to
receive payments, after all more senior
claims have been paid. Hence, they are first
in line to absorb losses on the underlying
mortgages. In return for assuming that risk,
holders of the least senior tranche require
the highest contractual interest rate of all the
tranches.
National Commission on Fiscal
Responsibility and Reform - A bipartisan
commission created by President Obama to
address the nation's fiscal challenges. The
Commission is charged with identifying
policies to improve the fiscal situation in the
medium term and to achieve fiscal
sustainability over the long run. Specifically,
the Commission shall propose
recommendations designed to balance the
budget, excluding interest payments on the
debt, by 2015. In addition, the Commission
shall propose recommendations that
meaningfully improve the long-run fiscal
outlook, including changes to address the
growth of entitlement spending and the gap
between the projected revenues and
expenditures of the Federal Government.
Net Interest - In the federal budget, net
interest comprises the government’s interest
payments on debt held by the public (as
recorded in budget function 900), offset by
interest income that the government
receives on loans and cash balances and by
earnings of the National Railroad Retirement
Investment Trust. See budget function and
debt.
Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
– White House office responsible for
devising and submitting the president’s
annual budget proposal to Congress.
Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) – An
international organization of 31 developed
and emerging countries (see list on slide
354) with a shared commitment to
democracy and the market economy.
Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)
– An accounting concept created by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) by pronouncements designed to
address expenses that entities may or may
not be legally bound to pay, but pay as a
moral obligation (such as retirees’
healthcare costs).
Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) - Procedures
established in House and Senate rules that
are intended to ensure that laws that affect
direct spending or revenues are budget
neutral. The Senate and the House have
had such rules in place since 1993 and
2007, respectively.

PEP / Pease (Tax Policy) - PEP is Personal
Exemption Phase-out designed to eliminate
personal income exemptions for high
earners; 3) Pease is a similar phase-out, but
instead of applying to personal exemption, it
applies to most of the itemized deductions of
a taxpayer’s claims (mortgage interest,
charitable gifts, state & local taxes paid,
etc.); Pease is named after Representative
Donald Pease (D-OH) who pushed for its
enactment in 1990.
Present Value - A single number that
expresses a flow of current and future
income (or payments) in terms of an
equivalent lump sum received (or paid)
today. The present value depends on the
rate of interest used (the discount rate). For
example, if $100 is invested on January 1 at
an annual interest rate of 5 percent, it will
grow to $105 by January 1 of the next year.
Hence, at an annual 5 percent interest rate,
the present value of $105 payable a year
from today is $100.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (PPACA) – A federal statute as the
result of the healthcare reform. Signed into
law on 3/23/10, the PPACA aims to expand
Medicaid eligibility, incentivize businesses to
provide health care benefits, prohibit denial
of coverage/claims based on pre-existing
conditions, establish health insurance
exchanges, and support for medical
research. The costs of these provisions are
offset by a variety of taxes, fees, and costsaving
measures, such as new Medicare
taxes for high-income brackets, taxes on
indoor tanning, improved fairness in the
Medicare Advantage program relative to
traditional Medicare, and fees on medical
devices and pharmaceutical companies.
Productivity - Average real output per unit
of input. Labor productivity is average real
output per hour of labor. The growth of labor
productivity is defined as the growth of real
output that is not explained by the growth of
labor input alone. Total factor productivity is
average real output per unit of combined
labor and capital services. The growth of
total factor productivity is defined as the
growth of real output that is not explained by
the growth of labor and capital. Labor
productivity and total factor productivity differ
in that increases in capital per worker raise
labor productivity but not total factor
productivity.
Tax Expenditures - Losses to the U.S.
treasury from granting certain deductions,
exemptions, or credits to specific categories
of taxpayers. Tax breaks are one method
Congress uses to promote certain policy
objectives. For example, deductions for
mortgages encourage home ownership,
while credits for childcare expenses allow
single parents to work. Tax expenditures are
an alternative to direct government spending
on policy programs.
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -
A program that permits the Secretary of the
Treasury to purchase or insure troubled
financial assets. Authority for the program
was initially set by the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008 at $700 billion in
assets outstanding at any one time and
remains in effect until October 3, 2010. The
TARP’s activities have included the
purchase of preferred stock from financial
institutions, support to automakers and
related businesses, a program to avert
housing foreclosures, and partnerships with
the private sector.

Trust Funds - In the federal accounting
structure, accounts designated by law as
trust funds (regardless of any other meaning
of that term). Trust funds record the
revenues, offsetting receipts, or offsetting
collections earmarked for the purpose of the
fund, as well as budget authority and outlays
of the fund that are financed by those
revenues or receipts. The federal
government has more than 200 trust funds.
The largest and best known finance major
benefit programs (including Social Security
and Medicare) and infrastructure spending
(such as the Highway Trust Fund and the
Airport and Airway Trust Fund).
