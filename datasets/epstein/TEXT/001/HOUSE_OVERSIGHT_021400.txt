Dear Mr. Lefkowitz, 
Here are the questions I'd like to ask Jeffrey Epstein. Would he be available to answer any of these on the 
phone or by email? People have told me some of his thoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could 
tell me or email me anything directly I could use on the record. Also I'd like to run the information I already 
have by you or him. 
Thank you, 
Alexandra 
-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation? 
Could he talk about his interest in science and the 2011 grants/conference? 
-How has his business been affected? Is there any new direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same 
clients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion? 
-Did he still work while in prison? How was that arranged? With whom was he working/advising? 
-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social life changed from three years ago? 
-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? 
-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions to his conviction? 
-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it too lenient or too harsh and why? 
-What is his side of the story and have people been supportive? 
-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started with Bill Clinton, etc?

Dear Ms. Wolfe, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021400 
I understand you have some questions about my client, 
Jeffrey Epstein. Given that much of the press coverage

instances, defamatory, I would like to suggest that you 
send me any facutal questions so that I can provide you 
with accurate responses. 
I am also available to speak with you. My number is 
212 446 4970. 
Thank you,
