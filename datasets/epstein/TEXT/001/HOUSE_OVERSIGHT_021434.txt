FBI: 'We still have a pending case' 
*. EPSTEIN from IB 
and Donald Trump among 
his friends. 
"Highly unusual" is how 
Palm Beach Police Chief Mi-
chael Reiter described State 
Attorney Barry Krischer's 
handling of the case in a 
bluntly critical letter to 
Krischer last year before 
Epstein was indicted. 
Reiter referred the mat-
`ter to the FBI to determine 
whether any federal laws had 
been violated. Epstein's allies 
countered by attacking the 
chief personally and profes-
sionally. 
Reiter's department in-
vestigated Epstein for 11 
months. Police sifted repeat-
edly through his trash and 
conducted surveillance on 
his five-bedroom, 71/2-bath, 
7,234-square-foot home on 
the Intracoastal Waterway. 
Police said Epstein paid 
women and girls as young 
as 14 to give him erotic mas-
sages at his home. Police 
thought there was probable 
cause to charge him with 
unlawful sex acts with a mi-
nor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation. 
(m Epstein responded by 
hiring a phalanx of lawyers. 
'One of them, Harvard law 
k professor and. author Alan 
Dershowitz, provided the 
I state attorney's office with 
information about alcohol 
el' and marijuana use by some 
of the girls who said they 
,K3 were with Epstein. 
4 Prosecutors then referred 
the case to the grand jury 
Teenage girls were 
recruited to visit 
Epstein for massages 
and sex, police hay. 
rather than fild charges di-
rectly against Epstein. 
Epstein's attorneys deny 
he had sex with underage 
girls. The lawyers say the 
girls' stories are not credible. 
But if the court file is any 
indicator, they've made no ef-
fort to depose the girls. 
Neither prosecutors nor 
defense attorneys have 
sought to question Robson, 
said Dutko, her attorney.,She 
recruited teenage girls to vis-
it Epstein for massages and 
sexual activity, Palm Beach 
police said, and presumably 
would be a key witness. 
Epstein's attorney Jack 
Goldberger did not return 
phone messages. 
A source close to the case 
suggested it is languishing 
pending a decision by the 
FBI on whether to refer it to 
federal prosecutors. 
"We still have a pending 
case," FBI spokeswoman 
Judy Orihuela said Monday. 
State Attorney Krischer 
did not return a call for com-
ment His spokesman, Mike 
Edmondson, declined to say 
whether federal investiga-
tors are delaying the Epstein 
case. But, ,he added; "if an-
other agency is looking at 
something, we wouldn't want 
to step on their toes." 
Attorneys say inertia in a 
criminal case often points to 
a pending plea deal. 
"It would not surprise me 
if something has happened 
that's not reflected in the 
court file," said Dutko, such 
as an agreement that will be 
formalized later. 
Defense attorney Marc 
Shiner said defense at-
torneys sometimes put off 
overtly conducting discov-
ery — deposing witnesses, 
requesting documents and 
the like — because doing so, 
creates more work for har-
ried prosecutors who may 
become angry and not offer 
a plea deal. . 
"Sometimes defense law-
yers, knowing that, will try 
and do discovery without 
taking depositions," said 
Shiner, a former prosecutor 
for 13 years. - 
Instead, they may conduct 
a below-the-radar probe such 
as having a private investiga-
tor check out leads, he said. 
Shiner and others say a 
plea deal for Epstein probably 
would result in pretrial inter-
vention, in which a defendant 
may be ordered to undergo 
a psychological evaluation, 
counseling or .other condi-
tions in return for dropping 
the charge. 
Edmondson, spokesman 
for State Attorney Krigeher, 
said there is no plea offer 
and no request for the pros-
ecution to show its cards. 
"To my knowledge, it's 
never happened before on a 
filed case," he said.

UNITED STATES 
EXTRADITION TREATIES 
(January 1, 2006) 
Stewart C. Robinson 
Deputy Director 
Office of International Affairs 
United States Department of Justice 
International extradition is the formal process by which a person found in one country is 
surrendered to another country for trial or punishment. The process is regulated by treaty and 
conducted between the Federal Government of the United States and the government of a foreign 
country. It differs considerably from interstate rendition, commonly referred to as "interstate 
extradition", mandated by the Constitution, Art. 4, Sec. 2. 
Below is a listing of extradition treaties signed by the United States. As indicated, not all 
of the treaties have entered into force as of the date this document was created. 
Please contact the Office of International Affairs, United States Department of Justice at (202) 
514-0000 to determine the status of a particular treaty. 
Over the last few years, the United States has focused its efforts on replacing extradition 
treaties that have become outdated and obsolete, as well negotiating treaties with first time treaty 
partners. Our most recent treaties include the "dual criminalitif approach rather than a listing of 
offenses for which extradition may be sought, clarify the procedures for provisional arrest, permit 
extradition whether the extraditable offense occurred before or after the treaty enters into force, 
allow the person sought to waive extradition, and permit temporary transfer of a fugitive serving 
a sentence in one state in order to expedite prosecution in another. In our newer treaties, one of 
the priorities of the United States has been to address two extremely difficult problems: the 
extradition of nationals; and extradition where the fugitive may be subject to the death penalty in 
the Requesting state. Not all of our treaty partners have agreed to extradite under these 
circumstances, but the issue is specifically addressed. 
The treaties highlighted "pending" in boldface, are treaties which have not entered into 
force as of the date of this listing. The law of extradition varies from country to country and is 
subject to foreign policy considerations. The first step a prosecutor should take before 
considering any action relating to international extradition, is to contact the Office of 
International Affairs, United States Department of Justice, at (202) 514-0000.

board. We then disembarked the plane. I Ihad one of his personnel 
go into the airport to ensure the female targets were not present 
inside the terminal. The CBP officer returned and advised Epstein 
was alone and was still processing through customs. 
At Approximately 8:55 AM, this writer contactedI J at 
ATC. This writer toldl Ithe plane had been checked. I ladvised 
he did not have to delay the plane or take any action to delay the 
flight as the pilot never requested permission to take off.

advised she had just obtained that information from 
another source.

series of events. In particular, the girls described how contact 
was made via telephone, primarily withI  
lat Epstein's 
home in Palm Beach. The girls would travel to Epstein's 
residence, usually in the company of another girl. The girls 
would enter Epstein's home via the kitchen, where they would be 
met by Epstein _________________. The girls would be escorted up to 
Epstein's bedroom where a massage table was accessible. The girls 
were told to undress - some undressed only partially and some 
undressed completely. Epstein would enter the room partially 
dressed, usually wearing only a towel. He would get onto the 
massage table face down. While lying face down, Epstein 
instructed the girl how to'massage him. After a period of time 
when! 
In addition to these sexual massages, some of the girls 
were paid additional sums to perform  more sexual activity, for  
example, engaging in sexual activity' 
'while Epstein watched. 
During the course of PBPD's investigation, a search 
warrant for Epstein's home was obtained and executed. Many of 
Epstein's belongings were removed from the home prior to the 
execution of the search warrant - for example, the computer 
processing units (CPUs) were removed from the house but the 
computer screens, keyboards, cords, etc. were left behind. The 
missing CPU's were never recovered. 
During the search, several telephone message pads were 
recovered. These message pads show messages taken from several of 
the girls who were interviewed and admitted to engaging in sexual 
massages or other sexual activity with Epstein. The messages 
contained text such as "I have a female for him" and "has girl 
for tonight." Some of the messages from the girls were addressed 
to Epstein  and others were addressed' 
'Additional messages recovered during the search 
contained text confirming appointment times.

JEFFREY HERMAN, lawyer for parents of girl, now 17, who accuses Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault 
Palm Beach man faces lawsuit in teen sex case 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — The parents of a 
teenage girl sued part-time Palm Beach resi-
dent Jeffrey Epstein for more than $50 million 
on Thursday, alleging that the wealthy money 
manager had her brought to his mansion for 
a massage, then engaged in sexual activity 
with her. 
The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, was 
14 at the time. She was the youngest of sev-
eral alleged victims of Epstein, according 
to Palm Beach police, who spent 11 months 
investigating him. 
The federal lawsuit, filed by Miami at-
* torney Jeffrey Herman, says "Epstein has a 
sexual preference and obsession for under-
age minor girls." Epstein "gained access to 
primarily disadvantaged minor girls in his 
home, sexually assaulted these -girls, and 
then gave them money." 
o Herman, who specializes in child sex 
abuse litigation, sued on behalf of the girl, 
her father and her stepmother on grounds 
of sexual assault, intentional infliction of 
. emotional distress and loss of parental con-
sortium. 
• . "Jane Doe ... fell into Epstein 's trap and 
became one of his victims," the lawsuit says. 
"We're dismayed by the filing of the law-
suit, but not surprised," said Jack Goldberger, 
qpne of Epstei4, attorneys. 'We think tWs 
shows what this case is all about: money." 
He and another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann 
Sanchez, launched an immediate counterof-
fensive, even showing up at Herman's news 
conference outside the federal courthouse in 
West Palm Beach. They distributed copies of 
documents showing that the *ids father and

docunients to Goldberger. 
"Jeffrey Epstein did not 
have sex with this woman," 
Sanchez said. 
Herman suggested that 
Epstein masturbated in front 
of the alleged victim and 
used a vibrator on her after 
she was brought to his home 
in February 2005. The girl is 
now 17. 
"This was a typical 14-
year-old girl at the time she 
met Epstein," Herman said. 
"What happened here was 
despicable." 
The girl told police inves-
tigators that she informed 
Epstein she was 18 when she 
met him, and she said that 
was her age on her Web page, 
Sanchez said. • 
The girl's father and step-
mother also attended the 
news conference. 
`We're very angry," the 
father said. "It's not right that 
this wealthy man can fly into. 
town and destroy my daugh-
ter's innocence.' He did not 
take questions. 
Epstein, 55, is a mysteri-
ous New York money man-
ager who owns a Manhattan 
mansion, as well as homes 
in Palm Beach, New Mexico 
and the Virgin Islands. 
A Palm Beach County 
grand jury indicted him in 
July 2006 on one count ofi 
felony solicitation of prostitu-
tion stemming from alleged 
incidents between Aug. 1 and 
Oct. 31, 2005. 
Epstein is scheduled to 
enter a plea in the case on 
March 10, but 
he has post-
poned other 
court dates 
to resolve the 
case. 
'His in-
dictment 
followed an 
exhaustive 
investigation 
by the Palm Beach Police De-
partment, which concluded 
that Epstein paid underage 
girls and young women to be 
brought to his five-bedroom, 
71h-bath Intracoastal home for 
massages and sometimes sex 
play. Much of the language in 
the Jane Doe suit mirrors that 
of police.reports in the case. 
Herman's client said her 
meeting with Epstein was set 
up by Haley Robson of Loxa-
hatchee, who was a Palm 
Beach Community College 
student at the time. When 
Jane Doe arrived at Epstein's 
home, she was escorted by an 
Epstein assistant, Sarah Kel-
len, to a room with a massage 
table, police reports and the 
lawsuit say. 
Epstein walked in wear-
Epstein 
ing only a towel, removed it 
and lay naked on the mas-
sage-table, the lawsuit says. 
He demanded that Jane Doe 
remove her clothing, and she 
did, except for her under-
wear, the lawsuit alleges. The 
sexual activity followed, the 
suit says. 
Epstein paid her $300 af-
terward, and Robson got $200 
for bringing the girl to him, 
the lawsuit says. 
Robson and Kellen helped 
Epstein arrange other liai-
son5s with girls, Palm Beach 
police concluded. Neither 
was charged. 
This- is not the first time s 
Epstein has been sued. over 
purported activities with 
teenage girls. He was sued 
in New York in October by a 
woman who says she had sex 
with Epstein when she was 
16 and had sought his help in 
becoming a model. 
The lawsuit filed Thurs-
day also alleges that Epstein 
has assaulted girls on his 
private island in the Virgin 
Islands. Herman declined to 
elaborate on that assertion.

Part-time Palm Beadier 
faces another sex suit 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— For the second time in two 
weeks, part-time Palm Beach 
resident Jeffrey Epstein has

$50 million by a woman who 
contends that he engaged 
in sexual activity with her 
when she was a minor after 
enticing her 
to give him

he said. "I have been con-

Herman filed a similar

The latest alleged victim 
is identified as "Jane Doe 
No. 2." She went to Epstein's 
Palm Beach mansion in 2004 
or 2005 when she was 16, 
the lawsuit alleges. She says 
another girl recruited her 
to go there to give Epstein a 
massage. 
Once there, she alleges, 
she was led to an upstairs

The two attended the same 
Palm Beach County high 
school. Jane Doe No. 2 is now

Both lawsuits contend 
that Epstein, 55, targeted 
"economically disadvantaged

perceived as less likely to 
'Complain to authorities, or 
whose credibility would be

"Both complaints are full of 
lies," said Guy Lewis, former 
U.S. attorney in Miami and 
one of Epstein's many attor-
neys. Jane Doe No. 2's lawsuit 
"is an outrageous, defamatory 
copycat of the first" 
There has been a twist in 
the first Jane Doe lawsuit. Her 
mother in Georgia contends 
that her former husband 
— Jane. Doe's father — con-

is asking a judge to halt the 
litigation until her daughter 
turns 18 in May and can make

The mother asked in court

suit, saying she "has suffered 
and will continue to suffer 
severe mental anguish and 
pain" as a result of Epstein's 
"reckless conduct." 
Jane Doe "just didn't'want

wanted to pursue it on her 
own. The father essentially 
did this on his own." 
Jane Doe has • been es-
tranged from her father since 
Thanksgiving, Leopold said. 
"That's why it's even stranger 
what he did," he said. 
The girl's mother is asking 
a judge in their divorce case 
to find the father in contempt 
of court for violating their 
divorce decree by not con-
ferring with her on a matter 
involving their daughter. 
"The father has sole custo-
dy and has the right to make 
decisions on his daughter's 
rights," Herman said. 
Epstein is a wealthy New 
York money manager who 
has counted Bill Clinton, 
Donald Trump and Britain's 
Prince Andrew among his 
friends. He was the target of 
a lengthy investigation into 
his activities with girls by the 
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment that resulted in his in-
dictment in July 2006 on one 
count of felony solicitation 
of prostitution. That case is 
pending. 
Epstein has been sued in 
New York by a woman who 
says he had sex with her 
when she was 16. Herman 
said he has received calls 
from others making the same 
assertions in that state. 
Herman convened a news 
conference Wednesday on 
the middle bridge connecting 
West Palm Beach and Palm 
Beach. 
"This is the bridge ... these 
girls were recruited to come 
over and give a massage," he 
said. "When they crossed this 
bridge, they had no idea what 
was in store for them, This is 
a bridge of tears." 
Herman has described 
both Jane Does as typical 
teenage girls Epstein robbed 
of their innocence. 
But Harvard University law 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
another Epstein attorney, pro-
vided the state attorney's of-
fice with information gleaned 
from the myspacekom Web 
site two years ago showing 
that some of Epstein's alleged 
victims boasted of their alco-
hol and marijuana use. 
Herman said the girls' 
backgrounds aren't relevant 
to Epstein's purported 'be-
havior "They don't have the 
mental capacity to consent 
to something like this with a 
grown man," he said.

Girl drops lawsuit against Palm Beach man 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
A girl who says that wealthy money 
manager and part-time Palm Beach 
resident Jeffrey Epstein engaged in 
'• sexual activity with her when she was 
14, has dropped her lawsuit against 
him because her divorced parents are 
squabbling over the litigation. 
"It has to do with the fact that the 
parents aren't on the same page right 
• now" said Jeffrey Herman, the attorney 
• for the girl, identified in court papers 
only as Jane Doe. "It's like a sideshow" 
The girl turns 18 in May and can sue 
• again at that time without her parents' 
involvement, Herman said. 
Herman sued Epstein last month on 
• 
behalf of the girl, her father and her 
Stepmother. Her birth mother, who lives 
near Atlanta, then asked- to intervene 
on her daughter's behalf and asked that

the litigation be halted 
until her daughter 
turns 18. 
• The mother com-
plained that Jane Doe's 
father did not consult 
with her or their 
daughter before suing 
Epstein ' for $50mi1-
lion. The lawsuit al-
leges sexual assault, 
intentional infliction 
of emotional distress 
and loss of parental 
consortium. Herman 
also represents a Jane 
Doe No. 2 who, like Jane Doe, claims 
Epstein summoned her to his home for 
a massage when she was a minor and 
sexually touched her. 
Epstein, 55, induced several under-
age girls to give him sexual niassages 
at his Intracoastal home, a Palm Beach 
Police Department investigation con-
cluded. He was indicted in. July 2006 on 
a single count of felony solicitation of 
prostitution. The case is pending. 
Jane Doe's parents separated two ' 
months after she was born at Good Sa-
maritan Medical Center, according to 
court records. The couple's subsequent 
divorce has been contentious. Each has 
had primary custody of the girl at various 
times. 
The father pleaded guilty to. fed-
eral fraud charges in 2001 and was sen-
tenced to 21 months in federal prison, 
plus three years probation. The US. 
attorney overseeing his prosecution 
was Guy Lewis. Now in private practice, 
Lewis was hired by Epstein to defend 
him against the father's lawsuit filed on 
behalf of Jane Doe.

Another suit alleges 
sex during massage 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— Another woman filed a 
federal lawsuit against Jef-
frey Epstein on Wednesday, 
• alleging that he turned a 
massage she gave him at his 
Palm Beach mansion into a 
sexual episode when she was 
16 years old. 
Identified as "Jane Doe 
No. 3," she is seeking more 
than $50 million, the same 
as two other "Jane Does" who 
filed similar lawsuits in the 
past six weeks. All three Suits 
were filed by Miami lawyer 
Jeffrey Herman. 
Herman subsequently 
'withdrew the first Jane Doe's 
lawsuit because of squabbling 
by her parents over the litiga-
tion. The girl may refile the 
suit after she turns 18 in May 
and can make her own deci-
sions, Herman said. 
Other alleged victims also 
have contacted him, Herman 
said. "I do anticipate more 
cases," he said. 
In the latest litigation, Jane 
Doe No. 3 alleges that she 
was recruited by a former col-
lege student, Haley Robson, 
to give Epstein a massage for 
money at his waterfront home 
late in 2004 or early in 2005. 
The lawsuit alleges that, 
while on the massage table, 
Epstein sexually touched 
Jane Doe No. 3, then mas-
turbated. She is suing on 
grounds of sexual assault and 
intentional infliction of emo-
tional distress. 
"She felt intimidated. She 
felt scared," Herman said. 
Jane Doe No. 3 made only the 
one visit to Epstein's home, 
he said. 
"It's just another copycat 
lawsuit filed by the same 
lawyer who appears less 
interested in the truth than 
in grandstanding with these 
press conferences," said Jack 
Goldberger, one of Epstein's 
attorneys. "We now have 
sworn testimony that girls 
lied about their age to Jeffrey 
Epstein, and they were care-
ful in being convincing that . 
they were over the age of 18." 
Herman said Robson 
instructed Jane Doe No. 3, 
"When he asks how old you 
are, tell him 18 or 19 years 
old." But he said it doesn't 
matter. "They were underage 
girls," Herman said. "They 
were sexually assaulted." 
In addition to the civil law-
suits, Epstein was indicted 
on a single count of felony 
solicitation of prostitution 
in July 2006 after a lengthy 
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment investigation into his 
activities with underage girls 
dt his home. A resolution has 
been delayed continually. The 
case is on Monday's court 
docket but is expected to be 
rescheduled once again. 
"One of the reasons (Jane 
Doe No. 3) came forward is 
she is tired of waiting for jus-
tice," Herman said.

Girl, sues Epstein, two others 
she says conspired in massages 
Jane Doe,' 1? sues in state court 
after dropping a federal suit. 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — A former Palm 
Beach Community College student who 
police say procured underage girls to give 
Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages at his Palm 
Beach mansion, and Epstein's personal assis-
tant have been sued along with Epstein over 
their alleged conduct. 
The girl behind the lawsuit was 14 years 
old when she contends he engaged in sexual 
conduct with her after she went to his water-
front home in 2005 to give him a massage. 
Her lawsuit, filed under the name Jane Doe, 
seeks unspecified damages from Epstein for 
sexual assault and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. 
She also sued Epstein, Haley Robson of 
Loxahatchee and Sarah Kellen of New York 
City on grounds of conspiracy and civil rack-
eteering. 
"We just want a full measure of justice for 
this girl," said her attorney, Ted Leopold. 
Robson, who attended Palm Beach Com-
munity College, was paid by Epstein to bring 
girls to his mansion for massages and more, 
according to Palm Beach police. "I'm like a 
Heidi Fleiss," they said she told them. Her 
attorney could not be reached immediately 
for comment. 
Kellen was an Epstein personal assistant 
who arranged the encounters, even escort-
ling the girls to his massage room, police 
Epstein 
In,dexing: 
"These two conspired With 
him to help with the criminal 
enterprise," Leopold said. 
Jane Doe, through her 
father and stepmother, filed 
a federal lawsuit against 
Epstein in January She dis-
missed it after her mother 
said she wasn't consulted 
about the litigation and 
sought to intervene. The 
mother is acting on her daughter's behalf in 
the latest lawsuit. 
Epstein's lawyer has denied the girl's al-
legations and said her family is simply at-
tempting to get money from a very rich man. 
Epstein, 55, is a Manhattan money manager 
who has homes there, in New Mexico and the 
Virgin Islands, in addition to his $8.5 million 
Palm. Beach mansion. 
Two other Jane Does have sued Epstein 
in federal court this year, making similar al-
legations to those of the first Jane Doe. Those 
cases remain active. 
Also pending against Epstein in state court 
is a felony charge of solicitation of prostitu-
tion arising from the same alleged incidents 
with several girls. That case is set for' trial in 
July, two years, after he was indicted. 
° Jane Doe's new lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach 
County Circuit Court, is the most explicit in 
detailing Epstein's alleged misconduct. It is 
the only suit to include Robson and Kellen 
as defendants, and the only one to make con-
spiracy and racketeering allegations. 
Jane Doe will turn 18 in May. She lives with 
other family members in Palm Beach County, 
is nearing graduation from high school and is 
working part time, Leopold said.

Beacher 
pleads in 
sex case 
Jeffrey Epstein will 
serve 11/2 years on teen 
solicitation charges. 
By. LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — He 
lives in a Palm Beach water-
front mansion and has kept 
company with the likes of 
President Clinton, Prince An-
drew and Donald Trump, but 
investment banker Jeffrey Ep-
stein will call the Palm Beach 
County Jail home for the next 
18 months. 
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty 
Monday to felony solicitation 
of prostitution and procuring 
a person under the age of 18 
for prostitution. After serving 
18 months in jail, he will be 
under house arrest for a year. 
And he ,will have a lifelong 
obligation to register as a sex 
offender. He must submit to 
an HIV test within 48 hours, 
with the results being pro-
vided to his victims or their 
parents. 
As part of the plea deal, 
federal investigators agreed 
to drop their investigation 
of Epsteih, Which they had 
taken to a grand jury, two law 
enforcement sources said. 
. Epstein was indicted two 
years ago after an 11-month 
investigation by Palm Beach 
police: They received a 
complaint from a relative of 
a 14-year-old girl who had 
given Epstein a naked mas-
sage at his five-bedroom, 
7,234-square-foot, $8.5 million 
Intracoastal home. 
Police concluded that there

The indictment charged 
Epstein only with felony so-

state attorney's office later 
added the charge of procur-
ing underage girls for that

Prosecutor Lanna Be- .

embarrassing incidents.

'It's validation 
of what we're saying 
in the civil cases.' 
JEFFREY HERMAN 
Attorney who represents alleged 
victims, commenting on the plea 
The judge was skeptical but 
agreed to it. 
Epstein's legal woes don't 
end with Monday's plea. 
There are four pending fed-
eral civil lawsuits and one 
in state court related to his 
behavior. At least one woman 
has sued him in New York, 
where he owns a 51,000-
square-foot Manhattan man-
sion. 
"It's validation of what 
we're saying in the civil 
cases," said Miami attorney 
Jeffrey Herman, who repre-
sents the alleged victims in 
the federal lawsuits. West 
Palm Beach attorney Ted 
Leopold represents one al-
leged victim in a civil suit in 
state court. He said he antici-
pates amending that lawsuit 
to add "a few other clients" 
as well. 
In the criminal case, po-
lice went so far as to scour 
Epstein's trash and conduct 
surveillance at Palm Beach 
International Airport, where 
they watched for his private 
jet so they would know when 
he was in town. They con-
cluded that Epstein paid girls 
$200 to $300 each after the 
massage sessions. 
"I'm like a Heidi Fleiss," 
Haley Robson, now 22, told 
police about her efforts in 
recruiting girls for Epstein. 
There was probable cause 
to chaise Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with .a minor 
and lewd and lascivious mo-
lestation, police concluded. 
The state attorney's of-
fice said questions about 
the girls' credibility led it to 
take the unprecedented step 
of presenting the evidence 
against Epstein to a grand 
jury rather than directly 
charging him. 
Palm Beach Police Chief 
Michael Reiter was furious 
with State Attorney Barry 
Krischer, saying in a May 
2006 letter that the prosecu-
tor should disqualify himself. 
"I continue to find your 
office's treatment of these 
cases highly unusual," he 
wrote. He then asked for and 
got a federal investigation. 
Epstein hired a phalanx of 
high-priced lawyers — includ-
ing Harvard law professor 
and author Alan Dershowitz 
— and public relations people 
who questioned Reiter's com-
petence and the victims' 
truthfulness. 
In addition to mansions 
in Palm Beach and Manhat-
tan, Epstein owns homes in 
New Mexico and the Virgin 
Islands. He's a frequent con-
tributor to Democratic Party 
candidates. He also donated 
$30 million to Harvard in 
2003. 
Former New York Gov. 
Eliot Spitzer returned a 
$50,000 campaign contribu-
tion from Epstein after his 
indictment, then resigned 
this year during his own sex 
scandal. And the same Palm 
Beach Police Department 
that vigorously investigated 
Epstein returned his $90,000 
donation for the purchase of 
a firearms simulator.

staff researcher Michelle Quig-
ley contributed to this story.

Edition: Palm Beach Post 
Rich man fought the law 
and he mostly won 
Two years after a grand jury 
indicted him on a felony charge of 
solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey 
Epstein finally admitted that he 
lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 mil-
lion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach 
mansion for sex. A week ago, the 
.55-year-old investment banker be-
gan serVing 18 months in jail. 
But that plea deal — guilty of 
felony solicitation of prostitution 
and procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution — does 
not account for all five of the girls, 
one as young as 14, who alleged that 
" Epstein sexually abused them. And 
why is Epstein serving his 
term in the overcrowded 
Palm Beach County Jail 
and not a state prison, 
where inmates are sent if 
their sentences are longer 
than one year? 
The slow, dissatisfy-
ing resolution of the case 
sends a message to the 
public that there's a dif-
ferent system of justice for 
the wealthy who hire high-powered 
lawyers. Epstein's legal team includ-
ed West Palm Beach defense attor-
ney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law 
School Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
who defended 0.J. Simpson against 
murder charges, and Kenneth 
Starr, the prosecutor who pursued 
then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 
months investigating Epstein be-
fore State Attorney Barry Krischer 
sent the case to a grand jury in-
stead of charging Epstein so the 
man who once boasted of accepting 
c;nly billionaire clients could face a 
trial. The police had taken a high 
school transcript, class schedules 
and phone messages from Epstein's 
Why is Jeffrey Epstein in 
jail, and not prison? 
home that showed he knew the girls 
were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer 
was more swayed by Epstein 's law-
yers, who attempted to impugn the 
girls' character by showing they 
had chatted on myspace.com about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. 
He should have let a jury decide 
whether the victims — and Epstein 
— were credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against 
Epstein finally reflected 
the age of one victim, and 
the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex of-
fender. With that additional 
charge, if Epstein had been 
convicted at a trial, he 
could have been sentenced 
to anything from probation 
to 15 years in prison, Assis-
tant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the 
recommended guideline sentence 
was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to cer-
tify to the court that he is receiv-
ing counseling, typically required 
of sex offenders, because he has 
a private psychiatrist But without 
court supervision, who will ensure 
Epstein is in fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal 
investigation of Epstein. If a federal 
investigation was warranted, how 
does dropping it before completion 
benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and de-
nied it. For three years, his wealth 
and the influence of his lawyers 
bought him the protection the state 
attorney owed to the victims.

THREE young women suing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for sex abuse 
at his Palm Beach mansion want a federal judge to quash the plea 
deal he made with the state of Florida to serve 18 months in jail in 
exchange for admitting he solicited a 14-year-old hooker. Their 
lawyer, Brad Edwards, has asked US District Judge Kenneth Marra 
to toss the deal - which included an agreement that Epstein's wouldn't 
face federal prosecution, which could have led to a longer jail term - 
because they weren't consulted on it. Marra has asked for more 
information before he rules. Epstein's rep, Howard Ruben stein, 
said, "The lawsuit has absolutely no merit. They're just looking for 
money. These women have lied repeatedly, and in no way shape or 
form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. 
And one of them showed Epstein a fake ID."

AS A CRIME VICTIM, YOU HAVE THE 
FOLLOWING RIGHTS under 
18 United States Code, Section 3771:

any public court proceeding, or any parole 
proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or 
escape of the accused;

FBI Victim Specialist may be able to help intercede on your 
behalf with employers and creditors, when appropriate. In 
addition, your Victim Specialist can refer you to other types of 
programs and services, such as emergency housing, 
counseling, support groups, and credit counseling. If the 
offender is convicted or pleads guilty, the court may order 
payment by the offender, called restitution, which may help 
cover expenses and losses caused by your victimization. 
IF YOUR PROPERTY WAS STOLEN OR 
HELD AS EVIDENCE 
If your property was stolen, we hope 
WI 
to recover it as part of our 
investigation and return it as soon 
as possible. If your property is held 
as evidence, we will notify you, 
maintain it in good condition, 
and make every effort to see 
that it is returned to you as quickly 
as possible when it is no longer 
needed as evidence. 
Please understand that some property we receive as 
evidence has been damaged during the course of the crime. 
IF AN ARREST IS MADE 
Every effort will be made to notify you if a suspect is 
apprehended. If criminal charges are filed, you will be 
contacted by the United States Attorney's Office (USA0) 
assigned to handle your case. 
Each USA° has a Victim Witness Coordinator 
to help answer your questions and deal with 
your concerns during the prosecution of the 
case.

Introduction 
The Department of Justice and the United States 
Postal Inspection Service are committed to ensuring 
that victims of federal crime are treated fairly as their 
case moves through the criminal justice system. 
In order to provide victims with information on case 
events, the Department of Justice has developed the 
Victim Notification System (VNS). This brochure 
provides information about VNS. 
Victim Notification System (VNS) 
VNS is a cooperative effort between the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States 
Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), the United States 
Attorneys' Offices, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP). 
This free, computer-based system provides important 
information to victims. In many cases you will 
receive letters generated through VNS containing 
information about the events pertaining to your case 
and/or any defendants in the case. 
This information is also available in English and 
Spanish on the Internet and through a toll-free 
telephone number (Call Center). In cases with many 
victims, you may receive only one letter and then be 
directed to the Internet or Call Center for further 
information. 
VNS Information 
Registration:  
You will receive a Victim Identification Number 
(YIN) and a Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
that will allow you to access VNS on the Internet and 
using your telephone. You may write those numbers 
on the attached tear-off card to keep with you. 
If you have chosen to participate in VNS, but have 
not received these numbers, please contact either the 
FBI, the USPIS, or U.S. Attorney's Office handling 
your case.

both required any time you

You may call 1-866-D0J-4YOU (1-866-365-
4968) for current information. You will be 
required to enter your YIN and your PIN.
