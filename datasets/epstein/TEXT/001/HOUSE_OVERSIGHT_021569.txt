2000. 
Epstein, 
Epstein 54, a money 
manager, 
told the teen he managed 
finances for Victoria's Secret' 
and "could get you into the 
catalog" if she were "nice" 
to him, court papers say. 
The papers say being "nice" 
included massages and other 
favors. 
When the girl told Epstein, 
"I am 16 years old and just 
want to model," he replied, 
"Don't worry, I won't tell any-
body," court papers say. 
Epstein, said by London's 
Mail on Sunday to be a close 
friend of England's Prince 
Andrew, has been indicted in 
Palm Beach on charges of so-
liciting underage prostitutes. 
That case is pending. 
The girl visited Epstein 
"several times over the sev-
eral months and engaged in 
bizarre and unnatural sex 
acts" while she was a minor, 
the lawsuit says. 
Epstein "repeatedly re-
quested that (the girl) return 
with her 14-, 15-, and 16-
year-old girlfriends, stating, 
'Come by with your friends 
your age next time. Don't 
bring Sherrie (a mutual 
friend in her 40s). I love girls 
your age.'" 
The young woman, now 
23, kept returning to Epstein 
because she has "mental 
issues," said her lawyer, Wil-
liam J. Unroch. He refused to 
elaborate, but court papers 
say she was "disabled as a re-
sult of severe mental disease 
and defect." 
Epstein's lawyer in New 
York, Gerald Lefcourt, said, 
"The girl has admitted she 
is insane, but she can read a 
newspaper and recognize the 
word 'rich." 
Lefcourt also said the 
statute of limitations has 
expired for the woman's 
case criminally and civilly, 
and will almost certainly be

He refused to comment on 
Epstein's Florida charges. 
Meanwhile, Unroch, 57, 
also acknowledged that his 
client was living with him 
and was at the center of a $10 
million lawsuit he filed last 
year against a neighbor who 
said he was having sex with 
underage girls. That case is 
pending. 
"What she was doing at 
22 is irrelevant to what hap-
pened to her when she was 
16," Unroch said Wednesday. 
He went on the say he hoped 
Epstein would agree to "do 
right" by his client and re-
solve the case out of court.

Suit accuses jailed 
tycoon of sex crime 
Jeffrey Epstein is in the county stockade. 
By SUSAN SPENCER-WENDEL 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— The line of civil law-
suits against billionaire 
financier Jeffrey Epstein 
has grown again, with 
the filing of at least the 
12th claim, by a young 
woman who also says 
she was lured to his Palm 
Beach mansion as a teen 
and sexually abused. 
Prominent Miami at-
torney Robert Josefsberg 
filed the most recent 
federal lawsuit last week, 
on behalf of the Jane Doe 
101 who allegedly visited 
Epstein a few times while 
17 years old and was paid 
$200 at least once for her 
time there, according to 
the complaint 
The lawsuit mirrors 
facts alleged in other 
suits: that Epstein had a 
predilection for teenage 
girls, identified poor, 
vulnerable ones and 
lured them to his home 
via other young women. 
The teens describe as-
cending a staircase lined 
with nude photographs 
of young girls and to the 
spa room where Epstein 
would appear in a small 
towel. 
Miami attorney Adam 
Horowitz, who repre-
sents six other Jane 
Does, said Monday that 
the cases are still in the 
"discovery" process, 
with plaintiffs request-
ing from Epstein phone 
records, pictures, videos. 
Horowitz said Epstein is 
refusing to turn over the 
materials, citing a Fifth 
Amendment right not to 
do so. "Stonewalling and 
delaying," Horowitz said. 
"I'm not surprised." 
Horowitz said he has 
asked U.S. District Judge 
Kenneth Marra to order 
Epstein to turn over the 
information. 
A local attorney for 
Epstein, Jack Goldberger, 
did not respond to a re-
quest seeking comment. 
Epstein was jailed 
in July 2008 following a 
plea deal where he was 
sentenced to 18 months 
in jail for solicitation of 
prostitution and procur-
ing a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitu-
tion and must register 
as a sex offender. He is 
serving his sentence at 
the Palm Beach County 
Stockade, according to 
jail records, and is due 
out in September.

Women 
want sex 
plea deal 
unsealed 
Their attorneys will ask a judge 
to open Jeffrey Epstein's records. 
By SUSAN SPENdER-WENDEL 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — When wealthy 
money manager Jeffrey Epstein of Palm 
Beach pleaded guilty last year to pro-
curing teens for prostitution, his case 
detoured around local and 
state rules regarding the 
sealing of court documents. 
At a plea conference on 
the state charges, a judge, 
a defense lawyer and a pros- - 
ecutor huddled at the bench 
and decided that a deal Epstein 
Epstein had.struck with federal prosecu-
tors to avoid charges should be sealed, 
according to a transcript of the hearing. 
And so it was. 
But Florida rules of judicial admin-
istration, as well as rules of the Palm 
Beach County court system, require 
public notification that a court document 
.has been or will be sealed, meaning kept 
from public view. The 'rules also require a 
judge to find a significant reason to seal,

'4A THE PALM BEACH POST • WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 2009 
Public has right to know details 
of deal, Post attorney will claim 
10. EPSTEIN from IA 
such as protecting a trade 
secret or a compelling gov-
ernment interest. 
Yet no notification 
or reason occurred in 
Epstein's case, according 
to court records. 
Epstein's own attorneys, 
in federal filings, have 
referred to his confiden-
tial deferred prosecution 
agreement with the U.S, 
attorney's office, struck in 
September 2007, as "un-
precedented" and "highly 
unusual." And it was "a 
significant inducement" 
for Epstein to accept the 
state's deal, observed the 
state judge who accepted 
his plea, County Judge 
Deborah Dale Pucillo. 
Epstein now faces at 
least a dozen civil lawsuits 
in federal and state courts 
filed by young women who 
said they had sex with 
him and now are seeking 
damages. 
Attorneys for some of 
those women want his 
agreement with federal 
prosecutors unsealed and 
will ask Circuit Judge Jef-
frey Colbath to do so today. 
"It is against public 
policy for these documents 
to be have been sealed and 
hidden from public scrutiny. 
As a member of the public, 
E:W. has a right to have 
these documents unsealed," 
wrote former Circuit Judge 
Bill Berger, now in .private 
practice and representing 
one of the women. 
The Palm Beach Post also 
will ask Colbath to unseal 
the agreement. Post attor-
ney Deanna Shullman will 
argue that the public has a 
right to know the specifics 
of Epstein's deal. 
According to various 
media accounts, Epstein 
moved in circles that in-
cluded President Clinton, 
Donald Trump and Prince 
Andrew. "International 
Moneyman of Mystery" de-
clared a 2002 New York mag-
azine profile of Epstein. 
Epstein, 56, is in the 
Palm Beach County Stock-
ade, serving an 18-month 
sentence after pleading 
guilty nearly a year ago 
to felony solicitation of 
prostitution and procuring 
teenagers for prostitution. 
He is allowed out from 7 
a.m. to 11 p.m., escorted by 
a deputy said Palm Beach 
County Sheriff's Office 
spokeswoman Teri Barbera. 
During a Palm Beach 
Police Department in-
vestigation, five victims 
and 17 witnesses gave 
statements. They told of 
young women brought by 
his assistants to Epstein's 
mansion on El Brillo Way 
for massages and sexual 
activity and then being 
paid afterward. 
At Epstein's plea confer-
ence last year, his attorney, 
Jack Goldberger, and 
then-Assistant State, At-
torney Lanna Belohlavek 
approached Pucillo in 
a sidebar conference. 
Pucillo, who had left the 
bench nine years earlier, , 
was filling in temporarily 
as a senior judge. • 
According to atranscript, 
Goldberger told Pucillo that 
Epstein had entered a con-
fidential agreement with 
the U.S. attorney's office 
in which federal prosecu-
tors brokered not pursuing 
charges against him if he 
pleaded guilty in state 
court Pucillo then said she 
wanted a sealed copy of the 
agreement filed in his case, 
and Goldberger concurred 
that he wanted it sealed. 
Belohlavek later signed off 
on it 
The Florida Supreme 
Court has expressed "seri-
ous cohcern" and launched 
an all-out inquiry into seal-
ing procedures across the 
state following media re-
ports in 2006 of entire cases 
being sealed and disappear-
ing from court records. 
"The public's donstitu-
tional right of access to court 
records must remain invio-
late, and this court is fully 
committed to safeguarding 
this right", justices wrote in 
their final report 
Epstein's office on 
Tuesday referred any 
questions to Goldberger, 
who declined to comment. 
Pucillo also has declined 
to comment °

Judge rules Epstein attorneys 
can subpoena abortion records 
By JANE MUSGRAVE 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — In 
a ,decision that could spark 
a constitutional showdown 
over privacy rights, a judge 
Tuesday gave lawyers rep-
resenting multimillionaire 
sex offender Jeffrey Ep-
stein the right to subpoena 
abortion records from 
women who are seeking 
millions in damages from 
the part-time Palm Beach 
resident. 
Palm Beach County 
Circuit Judge Donald 
Hafele said the records 
could help 'Epstein rebut 
the women's claims that 
they suffered psychologi-
cal ills after being, paid to 
give him sexually-charged 
massages at his Palm 
Beach mansion when they 
were as young as 14. • 
Hafele told Epstein's at-
torneys they couldn't go on 
a fishing expedition. The 
medical records, he said, 
can't be spught until the 
women are asked whether 
they have ever had an 
abortion, how many and' 
where. Further, he said, 
the records would not be 
Epstein 
The judge says 
the records 
would not be 
made public. 
made public and might not 
be admissible during trial. 
But, he said, since the 
women claim Epstein, 
now 57, is responsible for 
their emotional distress, 
his attorneys can explore 
the impact of other events. 
Medical records; Hafele 
said, are a better source 
of information than a 
person's memory 
Attorney Louis Silver, 
,who represents the Presi-
dential Women's Health 
Center, a West Palm Beach 
clinic where abortions are 
performed, warned Hafele 
that he was stepping 
on shaky constitutional 
grounds. 
"These records are 
protected by our consti-
tutional right of privacy" 
he said, referring to the 
Florida Constitution. 
After the. hearing, Sil-
ver said an appeal won't be 
necessary until Epstein at-
torneys seek the records. 
In another ruling 
Wednesday, Hafele also 
said that videos from 
depositions in the state 
cases can't be released 
without a court order. The 
ruling came after Epstein 
attorney Robert Critton. 
complaitied that a video 
of Epstein being asked 
whether he had an "egg-
shaped" penis became a 
youtube.com sensation. It 
first appeared on The Palm 
Beach Post Web site. 
Critton blamed attorney 
Spencer Kuvin for releas-
ing it. Kuvin said it was 
'public record. • 
The civil suits began 
mounting after Epstein 
agreed to plead guilty to 
two state charges: procur-
ing a minor for prostitution 
and soliciting prostitution. 
He served 13 months of 
an 18-month sentence. As 
part of the deal brokered 
with federal prosecutors, 
he agreed not to contest 
the accusations in the civil ' 
lawsuits. He can argue the 
women don't deserve the 
millions they are seeking.

Ex-Epstein worker faces 
obstruction charges 
The FBI says he tried to sell information to an agent.

Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Epstein NivEsr PALM BEACH — 
Papers A former employee of sex-
listed Palm scandal-plagued Jeffrey Ep-
Beach sex stein has been charged with 
offender's obstruction of justice after the 
victims employee alle7edly withheld 
critical information from fed-
eral agents — an expansive 
list of Epstein victims and 
.witnesses — as investigators 
probed the Palm Beach finan-
cier for sexual exploitation of 
minors.

the information for $50,000 
— Rodriguez calling it the 
"Holy Grail" or "Golden Nug-
get" — to a government wit-
ness, who is not named in the 
affidavit. 
The affidavit does not refer 
to Epstein by name, either 
In early November, an 
undercover FBI agent wat; 
sent it to make the buy from 
Rodriguez. Rodriguez, born 
in 195„ had told police that 
he wiled for Epstein as a 
butler' chauffeur, chef and 
housemn sometimes pick-

left behind after Epstein fin-
ished his encounters with the 
underage girls. 
According to the affidavit, 
Rodriguez met the under-
Information could have altered case 
EPSTEIN from 1B 
affidavit. 
Rodriguez told agents of witness-
ing nude girls whom he believed to 
be underage at Epstein 's pool area, 
of knowing that his former employ-
er was having sex with underage 
girls, and of viewing underage por-
nography on computers in Epstein's 
home. • 
• Special Agent Christina Pryor 
wrote that later review of the papers 
and book Rodriguez handed over 
revealed information "that would 
have been extremely useful in 
investigating and prosecuting the 
case, including names and contact 
information of material witnesses 
and additional victims." 
"Had those items been produced 
in response to inquiries of state law 
enforcement officers or the Special 
\ Agents, their contents would have 
been presented to the federal grand 
jury," Pryor wrote. 
The information allegedly with-
held by Rodriguez may have been 
a tipping point in the controversial 
probe of Epstein. Federal prosecu-
tors ended up striking an extraor-
dinary deal with Epstein and his 
top-flight lawyers: agreeing to rccall 
grand jury subpoenas if Epstein 
pleaded guilty to prostitution-
related felonies in state court, which 
he ultimately did. 
Epstein received an 18-month jail 
sentence. He served 13 months and 
was allowed to leave the jail most 
waking hours of the day. • 
An attorney for Rodriguez, Assis-
tant Federal Public Defender Dave 
Brannon, declined to comment on 
his behalf 
An unnamed government witness 
mentioned in the affidavit is likely 
one of the attorneys representing 
women in a gaggle of current civil 
lawsuits against Epstein. 
The affidavit outlines ,how the 
unnamed witness had deposed 
Rodriguez, who denied having docu-
ments, then received a call from 
Rodriguez later offering to sell for 
$50,000 the "Holy Grail." 
"Rodriguez explained that the 
information contained hundreds of 
additional victims and their phone 
numbers from diverse geographic 
locations including New York, New 
Mexico and Paris," according to the 
affidavit. 
Rodriguez is scheduled to be ar-
raigned in federal court Monday. 
Also in the affidavit are the 
reasons Rodriguez cited to the un-
named witness for why he withheld 
the lists from investigators: He con-
sidered it his property and should 
be compensated for it, and he feared 
the target of the federal investiga-
tion, Epstein, would make him dis-
appear or otherwise harm him.

The Daily Beast reveals new details about the twisted sex life of 
Jeffrey Epstein and his penchant for underage girls. Conchita 
Sarnoff on his massages, sex toys, and questionable deals. Also: 
• Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the 
bathroom soap was shaped like sex organs 
• Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three 
massage appointments each day 
• The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than 
Epstein—for trying to sell notes regarding massage appointments 
• Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency MC2 
• According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from Eastern 
Europe—then traveled on Epstein's private jets 
Newscom 
Jeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. They insist 
that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. As the police 
records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could "say no" at any time during a massage 
as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First 
she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he 
masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital penetration, and the more willing girls were 
lured into full-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts 
and police reports as Epstein's live-in "sex slave." 
A former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls 
traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on 
Epstein's private jets. 
It's true that some underage. girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several 
times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, 
particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements 
at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life around this sexual 
compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.

According to police who executed a search warrant, the house was 
decorated with large, framed photos of nude young girls, and similar 
images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized 
at the house (although police found only bare cables where other 
computers had been). Some bathrooms were stocked with soap in the

shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a "twin torpedo" vibrator and creams and lubricants available at 
erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs. 
Epstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and 
Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be 
charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties, 
worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily "massages" was stocked with fresh recruits. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years 
Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. 
Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits 
brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each 
received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
The victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave 
them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was 
a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled 
towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of 
him with a young girl. 
Ironically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more jail 
time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was fired, he says, for 
inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. 
He saw an unfamiliar "beater" in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriguez 
took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as "protection" against his own prosecution, and 
failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial investigation. 
Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this "golden 
nugget"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an 
undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with "obstruction of official proceedings" for withholding information 
that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. 
Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach 
county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms, 
another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. 
In a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash on 
hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them 
to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in 
return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by 
local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier 
donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given 
the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when 
Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, 
told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was "very passionate" 
about massages being "therapeutically and spiritually" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage 
training.) 
Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, owner 
of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova "deliberately engaged in a 
pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in 
sexual play for money." (Which would amount to trafficking.) 
Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in 
New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel

Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at 
Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish 
home—the city's largest private residence—and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch. 
CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated MC2 for a 60 Minutes broadcast several years ago, is quoted in Michael 
Gross' book about the modeling industry, Bad and Beautiful. Pyes told the author that Brunel "ranks among the 
sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls 
were not only harassed but molested." Now The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire 
transfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift 
or a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving 
evidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of 
Brunel's activities, Epstein said "I'm 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children." (Brunel has never been 
charged.) 
An American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very beautiful; many 
were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency's Miami office, who also 
arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private 
jets. 
Pilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other times, 
the pilot would just list the other passengers plus "female."

Hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first 
accused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast's 
Conchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved 
him from a long prison term. She reports: 
• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's "special treatment" and gave The Daily Beast an 
exclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. 
• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have 
landed Epstein in prison for 20 years. 
• Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former 
Soviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. 
• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be 
evidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was 
convicted of. 
• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered 
private investigators to follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. 
• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he "would have instructed the 
Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess." 
Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of 
privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach, 
which has been even less arduous than Polanski's time at a Swiss ski chalet. 
During Epstein's term of "house arrest," he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private 
Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 months in the Palm 
Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen 
lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform "massages" at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven 
victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an 
amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. 
With that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is 
closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and 
may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.

But the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; 
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry 
Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive only a slap on the 
wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting 
lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among 
them—to escape equal justice? 
Michael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to 
the transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims' civil suits, in which he explained how the case against Epstein 
was minimized by the State Attorney's Office, then bargained down by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an 
atmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several 
colleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2009 and now runs his own security firm, objected both to Epstein's plea 
agreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the 
deposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered "yes." 
In March 2005, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a 14-year-old girl, launched an 
investigation that would eventually uncover a pattern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning 
several continents, knowingly enabled by Epstein's associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever 
Epstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl would be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. ("The younger the 
better," he instructed Haley Robson, a local teenager who was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who 
declared, on a police tape, that she was "like a Heidi Fleiss," the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would 
be giving a "massage," the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and 
sometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $200 or more, depending on how far things 
went, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,000 cash on hand. 
The Palm Beach Police Department identified 17 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent; 
the youngest was 14, and many were younger than 16. And that was just at one of Epstein's many homes around the 
world—he also owns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by 
the FBI, reaching as far back as 2001, indentified roughly 40 victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein 
referred to as his "Yugoslavian sex slave" because he had imported her from the Balkans at age 14. Now 24, 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-20/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2010 
Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire oophile, Goes Free - The Daily Beast Page 3 of 4 
Marcinkova became a member of the household and is alleged to have participated in the sexual contact with 
underage girls. 
Epstein quickly got wind of the investigation, and progress on the case got messy very quickly. He hired a squad of 
lawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead, 
local detectives pressed on and brought the matter to the attention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal 
colleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared to have traveled out of state on Epstein's planes—plus the 
use of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2000 Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2002.) 
So when State Attorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida's Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant to 
mount a vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the 
attorney a letter complaining of the state's "highly unusual" conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case. 
He did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting 
prostitution. (Krischer has since retired and would not comment for this article.) The day after that indictment was 
returned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation. 
The details that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year, 
according to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three 12-year-old girls from France, who were molested 
then flown back to Europe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America, 
Europe, and the former Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruited for Esptein's sexual pleasure. 
According to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency owned by Jean Luc 
Brunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein's. Brunel received $1 million from the billionaire around 
the time he started the agency. 
The non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four 
members of his staff were investigated for "knowingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing 
and obtaining by any means a person, knowing that person has not yet obtained the age of 18 years and would be 
caused to engage in commercial sex act"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement allowed Epstein to plead 
guilty to only two lower-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution. 
Although the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against 
Epstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal, 
and that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed to bankroll their civil 
lawsuits. Attorney Dershowitz says Epstein's agreement to pay attorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage 
claims—without admitting guilt—amounted to "extortion under threat of criminal prosecution." 
But exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there 
were several earlier versions of the U.S Attorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been 
convicted, could have landed Epstein in prison for 20 years. Brad Edwards, attorney for seven of the victims, confirms 
the existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that 
Epstein "committed, at some point, to a 10-year federal sentence." But in the end Epstein's legal team refused that 
deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was "winnable" before a 
jury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Attorney's Office, which shared the state attorney's view 
that the prosecution was far from a slam dunk. 
For one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran lawyers, 
whose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton's relationship with an intern, would play rough. 
When the Palm Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershowitz 
began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. 
Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershowitz had launched background 
checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershowitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and 
Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knowing who ordered it. 
And the Florida victims began to complain that they and family members were being followed and intimidated by 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-20/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2010 
Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire ilophile, Goes Free - The Daily Beast • Page 4 of 4 
private investigators who were then linked to local attorneys in Epstein's employ. In one reported instance, the private 
investigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges. 
The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they 
were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of 
the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epstein's cash, 
intimidation, and charm. Those who were 16 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 20s by the time 
they took the stand, and Epstein's investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts. 
According to an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage 
parlors known as "jack shacks." Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Attorney's 
Office, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers. 
The Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age 
of 18 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is 
no defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of "consent." For a child under 16, even lewd 
behavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous 
crime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It 
wasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein's crack legal team, who 
repeatedly noted that the age of consent is lower in many other states. 
But that doesn't quite explain why the Department of Justice would forgo the child-trafficking charges, which pertain 
regardless of a girl's attitude or character. Epstein's final sentence is so out of line with the statutory guidelines for that 
crime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many powerful friends and 
attorneys. A highly intelligent man who once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors 
degree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philanthropy. He has 
made substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $30 
million to Harvard University. 
Moreover, many of his high-powered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein's private jets, for which the pilot 
logs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes showed that bold-face names were on the same flights as 
underage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson 
and Bill Clinton's wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered to give 
evidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. attorney general throughout most of the Epstein 
investigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he "would 
have instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess." But that may have been an 
impossible mandate, given the players involved. 
Instead, said attorney Brad Edwards, "Epstein committed crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life.., he 
was jailed for only a few months." And this week he walks through his door a free man.

Prince Andrew and the 17-year-old girl his sex

Epstein case revealed to The Mail on Sunday that she had, as a 17-year-old employed by Epstein, been 
flown across the world to be introduced to the Prince.

eyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein's private jets. 
One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 
2001 and published today by The Mail on Sunday, shows the Prince with his arm around her waist. 
This is not the first time the Duke of York's judgment and choice of associates have been questioned. He 
appears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middle East, North Africa and the 
former Soviet Union. 
The peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had 
languished unsold for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained. 
In the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official 
corruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, while he 
is also said to be close to Saif AI-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president, and may have 
had a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi. 
While on the streets, I slept with men for money. I 
was a paedophile's dream 
But it is Andrew's friendship with Epstein, whom he has known since at least 2000, and with Epstein's 
confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert Maxwell, that 
gives most concern. 
He was first seen with the pair on holiday in Thailand, and was pictured cavorting with Ghislaine at a 
Halloween fetishthemed party in Manhattan. 
The photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with 58-
year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in December, when 
he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner. 
It is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein's guest. 
A lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was a 
guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models. 'Some 
guests were horrified,' said the article's author, Vicky Ward. 
It should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his sentence 
for offences relating to child prostitution. 
However, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one 
reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can be 
in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges. 
Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his 
friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year old 
girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an 'erotic massage'. 
The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him. 
Eventually, Epstein struck a 'plea bargain' with prosecutors — a practice not permitted under British law — 
under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.

Police claim that his donations to politicians and his 'dream team' of influential lawyers deterred 
prosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names of a 
lot of Epstein's famous friends out of an embarrassing court case. 
However, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein's alleged victims were allowed to bring civil 
proceedings against him. 
He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls was to 
have been a key witness for the prosecution had the case gone to trial. She was just 15 years old when 
she was drawn into Epstein's exploitative world in 1998. 
In her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102' she alleged that her duties included 
being 'sexually exploited by Epstein's adult male peers including royalty'.

Prince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him I Mail On... Page 6 of 17 
Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing story. 
Her real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married mother 
of three. 
Over the course of a week during which she spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she appeared 
sometimes vulnerable, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent. 
Revisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind,Virginia occasionally buried her 
face in her hands. 
Some recollections — and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here — caused her to 
flush with shame. 'I'm telling you things that even my husband didn't know,' she said. 
Virginia, who has undergone counselling to try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her 
initiation into Epstein's depraved world. 
She was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful blue 
eyes made her look young for her years. 
Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on the 
West Coast of America. 
This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her family. 
The fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into 
trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away. 
Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. 'I was a 
paedophile's dream,' she says. 
Three years later, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved 
to Palm Beach, 
Florida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump's country club, Mar-a-Lago. 
Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant —which is where, soon after her 15th birthday, 
she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse. 
'I was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top — when I was approached by 
Ghislaine,' Virginia says. 
'I told her I wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who 
was looking for a travelling masseuse. 
I'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia's father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being 
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. 
He drove her to Epstein's pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey home 
in New York, the city's biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called `Zorro' in New Mexico and 
Little Saint James, a private 70- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.

• • 
Virginia says: 'Ghislaine said I was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home. 
My father left and I was told to go upstairs.' She was led by another woman through Epstein's bedroom 
into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table. 
He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions. Presumably, 
she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business. 
Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin. 
Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had shown 
her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter. 
Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. 'My face was red with 
embarrassment,' she says. 'But I felt under immense pressure to please them. 
The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his 
private jet and have a well-paid profession.' Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to return 
the next day. 
That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein. 
For three of those years, she was under Florida's age of consent, which is 18. 
Troubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001 
Virginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a 
teacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political, 
financial and academic establishment. 
As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.

He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an 'erotic massage.' 
Virginia said: 'I would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad he 
carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me. 
'And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash, Virginia felt 
even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more disturbing role. 
Epstein had trained me to do whatever men wanted. I 
told myself I was special 
'Basically, I was training to be a prostitute for him and his friends who shared his interest in young girls,' 
she says: 'After about two years, he started to ask me to "entertain" his friends.' 
It started when Epstein called Virginia at the Palm Beach apartment he had rented for her. 
She recalls: 'He said, "I've got a good friend and I need you to fly to the island to 
entertain him, massage him and make him feel how you make me feel." 
He didn't spell out what I had to do. He didn't have to. 'He'd trained me to do whatever a man wanted. I 
was shocked but I told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and I was special. 
I was worried, but I would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number one 
girl. 
He would keep telling me how lucky I was with the life I was leading and the money I was making. It was 
easy to fall into his grasp. 
'The way it usually worked was I'd be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the 
Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.' She was 'given' to men ranging in 
age from their 40s to their 60s. 
They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a world-
renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state. 
None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in 
Epstein's circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.

Counselling: Virginia at her mother's home at Palm Beach in 1998 
'They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,' she says. 
'But I was one of the very few he trusted as "special" and chosen to "entertain" his friends.' 
Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. 'It was an escape drug,' she says. 
'It made me calm and helped me forget about what I had to do. I was up to eight pills a day.' 
Epstein had no objection to Virginia's use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made her 
even more malleable. 'I didn't want to go back to the life I'd had before' she says. 
'That made me totally obedient.' Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now 
seemed normal to Virginia. 'I felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,' she said. 
'We'd do family things, like watch Sex And The City and eat popcorn. 'A lot of it was very glamorous. I 
met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. He introduced me as his 
"travelling masseuse." 
Some people mistook me for his daughter. 'When we were in New York or Palm Beach, Ghislaine and I 
would shop all day. 
Jeffrey bought me jewellery — diamonds were his favourite — and wonderful furniture. He was paying me 
very well because I'd give him sex whenever he wanted it.' 
She was, she says, delighted when Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001. 
'He said we'd be going to Europe and North Africa to meet architects and interior decorators because he

wanted to redo his New Mexico house. 
I threw my arms around him and gave him a peck on the cheek.' They flew to Paris, then Spain, then 
Tangier. 
Finally, they went to London. 'After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's house,' says Virginia. 'I 
was given a small upstairs bedroom. The following morning, Ghislaine came in. 
She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, "Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to 
go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight." 
'She said I needed to be "smiley" and bubbly because he was the Queen's son. 
Ghislaine and I went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores 
where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-
up. 
We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress. 
When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. 
Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. `Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain 
pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's daughters. 
Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17 and they all laughed. 
Ghislaine made a joke that I was getting too old for Jeffrey. 
She said, "He'll soon have to trade her in." It was widely known that he liked young girls.' The four of 
them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her. 
'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's. 
All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted something to 
show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left. 
'In the morning, Ghislaine said, "You did well. He had fun". We flew straight back to the States.' The Mail 
on Sunday has confirmed that the tycoon's jet flew to Paris on March 6, 2001, continuing to Granada, 
Tangier and London, before returning to New York. 
On the last leg of the trip, Virginia was paid about $15,000 (£9,400) by Epstein. 'It was amazing money, 
more than I'd ever made on a trip with him before. 
He didn't say there was any special reason, but I felt like I'd done everything he wanted. He was very 
pleased.' 
I took eight pills a day to help me forget what I had 
to do. It made me calm. 
There is no suggestion that there was any sexual contact between Virginia and Andrew, or that Andrew 
knew that Epstein paid her to have sex with his friends. 
However, the Prince must have been aware of Epstein's conviction when he stayed with him in New York 
in December.

Virginia says she met Andrew for a second time around Easter 2001 at Epstein's Manhattan mansion. 
'When I got to the mansion, I was told, "Get ready. You are meeting someone in the office" — which is 
what they called the library. Andrew was sitting there in a big leather armchair. 
Ghislaine had just given him a present, a big toy that was his Spitting Image puppet. 'He was smiling ear-
to-ear. He looked like a kid whose parents were taking him to Disney World. 
A beautiful girl called Johanna Sjoberg who worked for Jeffrey was sitting on Andrew's knee. Ghislaine 
guided me over to Andrew and I think he recognised me, though I don't know if he remembered my 
name.

Organiser: Ghislaine Maxwell looks on as Andrew put his arm around Virginia. Robert 
Maxwell's daughter invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse soon after her 
15th birthday 
We kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.' Johanna spoke to The Mail on 
Sunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.

She said: `Ghislaine put the puppet's hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put his hand on my breast. It 
was a great joke. Everybody laughed.' After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around $400 (£250).' 
She met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein's Caribbean island, Little Saint James. Virginia 
was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during the first two 
encounters and 18 at the third. 
Conviction: Jeffrey Epstein 
By now, however, Epstein, had started to hint that she was getting 'too old' for him. 
But during one trip to the island, Epstein and Ghislaine made their most astonishing proposition, and one 
which repulsed her. 'They said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,' she says. 
'They said I was part of their family and I was beautiful,young, loyal and nurturing and would be a great 
mother. 
They said I would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey having 
as many relationships as he liked. In return I would have my own mansion in Palm Beach and a large

• I 
monthly payment, a percentage of his income.' 
This, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been 
groomed. 
'It was a smack in the face,' she says. 'I finally realised this wasn't ever going to be a real relationship but 
I knew if I refused, I'd be thrown back on the streets. So I said, "I'm too young. I want to get my massage 
credentials, then maybe we'll do if.' 
The tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand where he 
enrolled her in a massage course. 
Shortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love and, 
just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony. 
'I called Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,' Virginia says. 'I was hoping he'd be delighted. But 
he said, "Have a nice life," and hung up on me.' The couple now have two sons, aged five and four, and a 
daughter who recently turned one. 
'The first few months after I married Robert were the worst,' she says. 'I couldn't bring myself to tell him 
much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out. 
'I felt very alone. I was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants. 
'Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned by 
the FBI. 
'They said they had found photos of me at Jeffrey's Palm Beach house,' she says. '[Epstein had] hidden 
cameras watching me the entire time even when I was in the bathroom. I was so embarrassed. 
'I told the FBI that my true purpose was sexual. They told me everything he did was illegal because I was 
under age.' (The age of consent in Florida is 18). 
'They said that if it had to go to trial, they'd need me because I'd lived with him and that made me a key 
witness. I was very afraid, because he had so much power, but eventually I agreed to testify. 
I was glad he'd finally been found out. He shouldn't be hurting other girls. Following Epstein's arrest, 
investigators are believed to have found a list of men's names on his computer and asked him whether 
they had been 'treated' to sexual encounters with his menage of minors. 
'He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question, it 
could be incriminating,' a source told The Mail on Sunday. 
Epstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a 'slap on the wrist' for him, and 
ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme Lawyer Brad 
Edwards, who represented several of Epstein's victims, said: 'Rather than punish him the way they would 
an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power and influence, the system 
can be bought.' 
Virginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings bottled up 
until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.

family were/are. Prince Andrew is not the epitome of being English. What you are talking about is related to a small minoirty of 
individuals who just happen to be English. If they behave badly, then it says something about them, their chosen lifestyle, or 
the circles they move around in. What it does NOT, is have any bearing on the rest of the nation! So please, let's not get into 
provocative Scottish vs English battle - history is what it is - the PAST. And I certainly won't be accountable for what someone 
else did long before I was born or simply beacause I am also English. I am proud to be English, that is what I am. Now British -

I was truly disgusted having read this article. Although sadly not surprised, I wonder why people idolize any kind of celebrity or 
other such "influential" people, most of whom seem to surround themselves with depraved "friends" & whom can turn a blind 
eye to anything where status, fame & wealth are concerned (seemingly typical of our "anything goes" society where everything 
is justifiable). That aside, I am more disgusted that out of the 24 comments on this article so far, people are either talking about 
what a pretty piece of tot she is, how she should have basically kept her mouth shut, how we can't be judged by the actions of 
our friends, whether the royal family has any validity (as if it ever had a clean past), & most astonishingly arguments about 
whether Fergie has more right to a royal wedding invite than Andrew! Absolutely disgusting, looking forward to further 
comments on her weight, whether she looks good for her age, & scrutiny over whether she's had any work done soon.

Prostitution Ring Leader Sentenced To 21 Months 
November 11,2001 I Staff report 
A man extradited from Germany has been sentenced to 21 months in prison 
and fined $6,000 for recruiting Czech women to a prostitution ring with 
promises of modeling work. 
Ronald Eppinger had faced up to 10 years after pleading guilty this month to 
charges of alien smuggling for prostitution, interstate travel for prostitution and 
money laundering. 
Eppinger worked with two Czech women to get tourist visas for the future 
prostitutes and kept nearly half of their earnings from operations in Miami, New 
York, Texas and the Bahamas, prosecutors said. Women were brought to the United States illegally from 1997 to 1999.

As part of his plea, Eppinger forfeited a boat and limousine used to promote the call-girl service. 
Eppinger learned he was under investigation in June 1999 and moved from the United States to the Czech capital of Prague. 
He was arrested in Germany last December while traveling from the Czech Republic to Spain and was sent to the United 
States in May.

U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra is set to decide in the coming 
days whether the rights of two alleged victims of Palm Beach sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein were violated when the U.S. Attorney's 
Office failed to confer with them before signing a non-prosecution 
agreement in September 2007. 
Attorneys Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, representing Jane Doe 
No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2, argued Friday in federal court in West 
Palm Beach that the government's action violated the girls' rights 
under the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Edwards and Cassell want the agreement nullified and want Marra to 
unseal un-redacted plea deal correspondence between the U.S. 
Attorney's Office and Epstein's defense team. If he agrees, that 
action could spur a federal case that might expose Epstein to a 
longer incarceration if convicted. 
After Palm Beach police received a complaint about Epstein in spring 
2005, more than 30 young women participated in civil lawsuits that 
alleged he lured them to his home for sexually charged rubdowns 
and/or sex in exchange for cash when they were minors. Some 
cases were dismissed, and others were settled.

Sides argue whether Jeffrey Epstein's nonprosecution deal violated alleged victims' rights Page 2 of 4 
• • 
Epstein, now 58, pleaded not guilty in August 2006 in state court. 
Eventually he agreed to a state plea deal and served 13 months of 
an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and 
soliciting prostitution — but only after his attorneys successfully 
argued for the federal non-prosecution pact. 
The U.S. attorneys sent letters to Jane Doe No. 1 and No. 2 twice in 
2008 describing their case as being under federal investigation — 
even though a non-prosecution agreement had been created the 
previous year and had been kept secret from the young women, 
according to Edwards. Edwards said the latter action "eviscerated the 
rights" of the two women to bring Epstein to justice. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee told Marra that the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act dictates that victim notification is triggered only after an 
indictment. 
Cassell disagreed. "It wasn't designed to be so narrowly 
circumscribed," the Fort Lauderdale lawyer said. 
Lee said requiring federal attorneys to confer with alleged victims 
before they can determine whether an indictment is warranted would 
impinge on prosecutorial discretion. "The government believes these 
rights would attach only after a formal indictment," Lee said. 
Marra questioned that assertion. "I think we wouldn't be here if your 
office had conferred with the victims, heard them out," and explained 
why prosecution wasn't pursued, the judge said. 
Lee countered that alleged victims have no right to confer with the 
government when the government is not "in the case." 
The judge reserved ruling on the plaintiffs' motion to unseal the 
federal attorneys' plea deal correspondence with Epstein's legal 
team. 
He gave famed criminal defense attorney Roy Black two weeks to 
submit materials explaining why the letters should not be turned over 
to the two young women's lawyers. The U.S. Attorney's Office will 
then have two weeks to respond, then the plaintiffs' team will have a 
week to respond. Black will then have a week to deliver his final reply 
to the judge. 
Black had argued that the correspondence was protected by attorney 
-client privilege. "Any statements made in regard to plea bargaining 
are immunized" whether related to statements of culpability or not, 
Black said. "This is classic work product we sent to the government."
