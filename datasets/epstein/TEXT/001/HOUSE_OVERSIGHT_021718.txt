Struggling Havensight merchants see r�nt-abatement
as last chance for them to resuscitate their businesses
By AMANDA NORRIS
Daily News Staff
ST. THOMAS - For mercbants
at Havensight mail, it's summer
time, but the living is anything but
easy.
After being granted six months
offrec rent by the mall's owner, tbe
Governnient Employees Retirement
System, mauy said this has been
the worst off-season they -have
experienced.
They cited a perfect storm of
prolonged road construction in
front of the man, fewer cruise ships
docking in St. Thomas Harbor,
competition from Crown Bay mercbants
and skyrocketing utility
costS".
Whcn tbe GERS board voted to
relieve.the tenants of rent obligations
from July 1 to Dec. 31, tbey.
did so because tenants had accumulated
a delinquency of more than
$2 million and reported tbat tbey
could no longer sustain the cost of
doing business. The board discussed
tbe closure of Dockside
Booksbop, wbich'has announced
tbat it will close witbin tbe next
two weeks aftcI 35 years in
business.
GER·S. Administrator Austin
Nibbs presented tbe board with two
options: forego rent for six months
altogether witb tbe stipulation that
tenants pay all arrearages by April
1 or give tenants a 25 percent
reduction in rent over the next 24
months. Tbe board decided tbe six
month abatement, which would
cost GERS a little more tban $3
million, would be tbe most feasible
way to give tenants a chance to pay'
the $2 million in back rent owed.
"I don't like this rent abatement,
but if we want'to continue· to have
tenants, we are· going to have to
belp them," Nibbs said.
At the meeting, some board
members were under the impression
that another Havensight business,
-an office supply store called
The Draugbting Shaft, was also
scheduled to clqse, but. according
to· Th� Draughtiog Sbaft owner,
Terry Robinson, that was never the
case.
Nevertheless, Robinson said, he
bas had discussions witb GERS
board members and attended meetings
to inform them of the adverse
conditions that had caused him to
fall bebind in his rent.
Robinsoo said his business, unlike
ID3I1Y of the boutiques and stores that
cater primarily to tourists, had been
unduly hit by prolonged construction.

traffic into and out of the . mall's parking
lots.'

Dockside Bookshop in Havensight Mall is scheduled to close within the next .
two weeks after 35 years in business.
"Many of our customers are locals
. and residents, and many have called
and said they just don't want.to come
in because they don't want to deal
with, it," Robinson said of the construction.

bad reported that they would
go under this year or the next, he
said.
'The mall has been burting since
Crown Bay opened. We lost about
500,000 passengers because of that,"
Mirpuri said. He added tbat the larger
Carnival cruise ships, the Oasis of
the Seas and tbe Allure of the Seas,
dock at Crown Bay, where the harbor
can support them.
Projections are that. with !TIOre
cruise sbips scbeduled tbrough
2014, businesses on tbe brin,k of closure
might be able to use the abatement
to get througb to a breakthrough
season in the winter of
.2014, Mirpuri said.
. Other mercbants said their WAPA
bills had tripled or quadrupled since
they opened, leaving them to wono
der if an abatement would be enough
to counter the rising rates.
"WAPA is killing us," Sonny
Panjabi, owner·of the Casa Branca
jewelry store, said. Utility bills total
$3,000 during the busy season, and
- Sonny Panjabi,
jewelry store owner
$2,000 during the slow season, when
hours of operation are cut back, he
said. ' .
"We were almost closing down.
There was no way we could swvive.
We are extremely grateful for the
abatement. It will be a big help," be
said.
Since the recession hit, travelers
"seem to spend all their money on
the trip itself, and they come with
less disposable income/' according
to Jerry Woodhouse, president of St.
John's Bay Rum, a fragrance company
that supplies otber Havensigbt
stores and has offices be·hind the
mall.
Woodhouse also said that in the
last decade hotels, whicb used to provide
transportation to shopping districts,
have shifted to providing as
many amenities as possible to guests
and have limited the excursions to
beaches ratber than sbopping
districts.
"They want to grab as much revenue
as possible per customer while
tbey are staying at tbe bote 1,"

V.I. government agencies defend budget requests
By AMANDA NORRIS

ST. THOMAS - Last week, the

Public Services Commission
P'ublic Services Commis.sion
Executive Director Keithley Joseph
testified that it is the commission's
mission's goal to move from being a
"government organization that is reactive
to a proactive public policy making
agency with results-based
management."
The Public Services Commission is
primarily funded through assessments
levied on the utilities it regolates.
Joseph testified that the fiscal 2014
budget request from the V.I. government
for the 'commission would be
$1,6io,740. This represents an
increase of $57,373, or 3.54 percent,
from its fiscal 2013 revenu ... ssessment
of $1,563,367. Pursuant to
VIrgin Islands Code establishing the
commission and stipulatiog that it be
100 percent funded by fees levied to
the utilities it regulates, the commission's
budget request reflects what it
needs to maintain operations while it
collects outstanding assess'ment from
communications, water and electric,
and public transportation companies,
Joseph said.
The commission's uncollected revenues
from fiscal 2013 are $384,630,
according to Joseph's testimony.
It·is anticipated that in fiscal 2014,
the commission will collect a total of
$1,620,739 from the V.1. Water and
Power Authority; VITELCO,
Innovative Cable, Varlack Ventures,
Transportation Services and the v.1.
Waste Management Authority, according
to testimony.
A to1al of$I,081,H3 will go toward
"personal services and fringes,"
according to testimony.
V.I. Economic
Development Authority
V.l. Economic Development
Authority Chief Executive Officer
Percival Clouden requested a General
Fund appropriation of $5,043,274.
This amount represents an increase
of $325,574, or 6.9 percent over the
fiscal 2013 appropriation.
According to Clouden, !lie additional.money·is
needed to match federal
funds for a small business incubator
program, to institute a more
aggre . ssive marketiog strategy for the
E c'o n om i c .of D e ve lop men t
Commission's tax incentive program
and to enhance computer data analys.is
programs for the Economic
Development Commission and'the
lending divisions, according to
Clouden's testimony.
DUring fiscal 2013, the authority
received $2 milliolil in grants from
the United States Department of
Commerce Economic Development
Administration to assist small and
mid-size businesses in the territory.
The authority also relocated its offices
on St. Thomas, realizing a 20 percent
savings rental costs, 48 percent
in utilities and 15 percent in other
related expenses, Clouden said.
Also during fiscal 2013, the
authority realized a 4 percent increase
in collections and saw a 37 percent
decrease in the number.of delinquent
borrowers due to enhanced litigation
efforts, Clouden said.
To date, the authority has approved
$692,606 in new 2013 loans and collected
$842,224 in outstanding
accounts, The number of delinquent
borrowers standa at 242, for a to1al of
$7,470,534, according to Clouden's

Authorities targeting unregistered sex offenders
By JENNY KMIE
Daily News Staff
ST. THOMAS - Although a
sweep for unregistered sex offenders
netted nine unregistered offenders in
rccent 'wceks, an unknown number
still remain at large in the territory.
The Virgin Islands Department of
Justice paIred with local police and
U.S. marshals to sweep the islands
for unregistered sex offenders last
week, primarily targeting ones that
have been convicted within the
Virgin Islands. AU but two local
unregistered offenders .last week
were arrested and charged with fail,
ing to register.
Local police and U.S. Marshals
initially arrested five unregistered
offenders on St. Croix and three. on
St. Thomas in just seven days, and
then arrested another at th¢ very end
of last week on St. Thomas - bringing
the total to nine. .
The department, however, has little

What a city owes its reside·nts
Though it is the biggest city in
U.S. history to file for bankruptcy,
Detroit is only one' of 26 urban
municipalities that qave gone into
bankruptcy or state rec�ivership for
fiscal insolvency since 2008. Detroit
should draw attention and debate to
a challenging issue underlying all
these public insolvencies: What
level of public services will we protect
and guarantee for U.S. cities?
The Bankruptcy Court will have
to fa ce that question. It will have to
determine whether Detroit can cut '
into current services any more than
it already has. Unless. the state or
federal government steps in with
funds for operating costs, the bahkruptcy
will function as a zero-sum
game, with residents fighting creditors
for a share of city revenue.
Creditors have contracts to monetize
what they are seeking, but how
should the court detennine the public
spending that residents need
today 'and tomorrow?
Politicians and judges who manage
local fiscal crises speak of
maintaining basic services and
e'nsuring residents' minimal health
and safety, but these concepts are
sbort on specifics. While our laws
provide an entitlement to a public
education, and we have long struggled
to interpret what constitutes a
legally adequate ed�cation, there is
little to nothing that would tell us
what other services the local public
sector must provide.
. As a matter of law, ther,e is no
such thing as a crime rate that is too
high or an ambulance response time
that is too long. Should tbere be?
For now, it is left: to politics and
mora/ judgment to determine whether
it is acceptable that less than one
in three streetlights are operational
in Detroit O( that th� city has 80,000
abandoned and blighted structures
that it cannot afford to demolish. In
Detroit, as in many other struggling
cities, dramatic police layoffs mean
that the average wait time after a
911 call for a police officer is 58 .
minutes, and a resident can rarely
summon an officer at all jf the
. reported crime is not in progress and
violent.
As for other public functions that
a high-poverty city (especially one
with..severe winters) might hope to
have - such as reliable bus service,
playground equipment, indoor
basketball F0urts, after-school programs,
active libraries and community
centers for the elderly - these

services are decades into deep cuts '
and widespread closures. Indeed,
having curtailed everything beyond .
emergency services, it would be
tempting to refer to a government
like Detroit's as a night-watchman
state - the libertarian ideaJ of a
government focused only on publ'ic
. safety,
That is, we'd be tempted 'to use
such a term for Detroit, and cities
like it, were it not such a cruel irony:
Detroit had'more than 15,200 violent
crimes and, 500 acts of arson in
2012. The night watchmen are
understaffed and underpaid.
According to a 2012 study by economists
Aaron' Chalfin and Justin
McCrary, public spending in Detroit
on each police officer (including all .
wages, benefits and retirement costs)
is less than 'two-thirds what it is just
45 miles away in the prosperolls
university town of Ann Arbor.
As a political and moral matter, as
much as a legal one, Detroit represents
an opportunity to take a stand·
for urban habitability. What belongs
on our list of minimum standards for
a city? Detroit invites us to have a
public conversation about what services
and public spaces we expect
from city governments for human
dignity and for humans to flourish,
We have a chance to say that no one
should have to wait hopelessly for
an ambulance, that a violent crime
in a neighborhood every few hours
. is intolerable.
Paying for such commitments
should not just be the burden of
creditors, Many of the city's creditors
are rank-and-file public employees
and reHrees who have counted
on a public pension and are not eligible
for Social Security. Detroit's
bankruptcy plan could send them
into poverty in their old age.
Basic services and safety in our
cities are the responsibility pf
states, the fe deral government, the
private sector and voters. It is all of
them - alt of us - who have a
role to play in the stabilization that
Detroit ·is seeking. through bankruptcy.
All of us have a responsibility
to help them give basic ·health
and safety real meaning, and to
make this bankruptcy a safety net,
not a punisliinent.
