My initial estimate, given to me by Pablos, was 25, and that was based solely on his quick look at the situation, 
and not knowing what was really out there. In fact, as I have repeated many times, the job was far far worse 
that originally expected, you have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now, 
they have started up in the last week full force again, as it is obvious that they can't fux with your wiki page 
any more as we blocked that.. The woman from the Daily Beast. We have programs that track this stuff, and 
so, for the past few days, Mike has been having a cyber war with her minions, who are actively trying to undo 
what we are doing, as she is trying to push her Daily beast and other articles back up. So, we have to go back 
and push them back down. 
Then, there was the issue of trying to create additionally on you a positive web presence, with the science and 
org sites. 
I spend literally four months of non-stop work, creativity, and my own political capital to getyou this so far, 
which saved you not only time, but countless dollars, and isn't something that can be readily bought. I had 
people working also for free. I gained access to information that standard seo companies don't have. In 
addition, I wasted a lot of time talking to people who promise to help, but end up providing nothing, and so, I 
end up having to do it myself What do I get in return, constant back slapping to my head... 
We were trying to fix up your mess. I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was 
NEVER about trying to pull money out of you, and fact, we have don't everything possible to keep the costs 
down considerably. 
I must talk to you about the island thing asap. When can we do that?

Jeffrey, 
The hots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article 
left on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to 
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on 
a daily basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the 
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word 
to this day by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE 
did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep 
it prominent. 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now 
removed. 
Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head 
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, 
Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your 
wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful 
editing and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, 
and now has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success. 
We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google 
search. 
We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material. 
And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, 
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add 
new content to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped 
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push 
Huffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a google 
search are not of your mug shot, etc. 
Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to 
depromote you. 
As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you 
have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter, 
and you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major 
work has been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input 
and supervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers 
need to know what to write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have 
not allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result it suffers. 
You paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500 
balance is now due if you want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, 
and if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there. 
This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10 
very toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline.
