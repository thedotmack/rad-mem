Dear Partner, 
I hope this letter finds you well — please see the below updates on the Park Mansion: 
I am happy to report that we have completed the building's demolition stage. I have included a 
few photos for your reference. 
Furthermore, we are very close to filling our building permit and we have finalized our design 
for the units. Please see the attached plans. The team is finishing interviews with General 
Contractors (GCs) and has come down to the final five GCs that will be allowed to bid on the 
project. 
Additionally included are visuals for the sidewalk shed and a rendering for the website. 
Please fell free to contact me if you have any questions at 
Thank you so much for your trust and friendship,

The Upper East Side's last 
affordable pocket goes luxe 
By Hallo R. Alberts

Take in views of Yorkville (and beyond) from a posh 20 East End Ave. terrace.

It's a tale (practically) as old as time. When New York City real estate thrives, home 
builders and buyers seek to colonize neighborhoods previously deemed undesirable. 
The Financial District was once the exclusive domain of nine-to-fivers; these days, 
every other office building is a condominium. Along the Hudson River, midtown 
Manhattan used to be an industrial no-man's-land of warehouses and strip clubs. 
No more — residential projects abound. And now the Upper East Side neighborhood 
dubbed Yorkville, which stretches from about 72nd to 96th streets east of Third 
Avenue, is ready for its turn.

detail 
The area, defined by its dearth of all-glass towers and 
plethora of tree-lined streets, has long been a favorite 
for blue-bloods looking to live near prep schools and 
the FDR Drive — for weekend getaways out East, of 
course. 
But as both land and condo prices hit record highs, it's 
QueensI attracting a fresh wave of interest. More than a dozen 
new buildings are on the way, and with them a crop of 
buyers who see Yorkville as a place where apartments 
are a relative bargain. 
Yes, until the Second Avenue subway comes online in 
approach the East River. But the Q extension's 
imminent completion — coupled with a new Whole Foods and easy access to parks, 
museums, hospitals and other family-friendly perks — all mean people want in on a 
neighborhood in the throes of a transformation from nice 'n' quiet to construction-
induced, decibel-busting busy. 
Extell Development sure wants a piece of the action, shelling out $100 million for a 
Gristede's grocery store on 86th Street near First Avenue. (The property giant already 
owns at least four tenement buildings in the vicinity, and reports say it's cobbled 
together enough land to build something big.) Extell has also filed plans for two 
smaller projects on 92nd Street and Second Avenue, plus, it's already begun the 
foundation of a 30-story building at the corner of 95th and Third Avenue, just a block 
south of the boundary with East Harlem. Called The Kent, sales of 83 luxe two- to five-
bedroom residences in a handsome brick structure will hit the market in the fourth 
quarter. Talk about flooding the zone!

Note that The Kent, set for completion in the fall of 2017, is replacing a row of walk-up 
tenements that used to dominate their block. Similarly, Icon Realty spent less than $50 
million for a comparable row on Second Avenue in the 80s, which it is demolishing

with the goal of putting up a chic high-rise on the site. It's markedly cheaper than 
Extell's deal, in part because Icon started assembling properties in 2007. (Icon is 
working on a second high-rise as well as a shorter rental building in the same neck of 
the woods.) 
Just look to other data and the same trend emerges. In 2010, Yorkville's median sale 
price was $663,500, according to real estate listings site StreetEasy. Compare that to 
the first seven months of this year — it's 14 percent higher, at $757,500. But remember, 
the sub-market remains cheaper relative to the Upper East Side at large, which boasts 
a year-to-date median of $1.15 million.

Despite the building boom, some low-rises remain, housing institutions, such as 
German butcher Schaller & Weber and beer garden Heidelberg, that are vestiges of 
centuries past when Yorkville was an immigrant enclave.

Let's hope they can hang on: Even more small buildings were razed to make way for 
star architecture firm SHoP (of Barclays Center fame) to design a tower of 83 condos 
with Anbau Enterprises at the corner of 89th Street and First Avenue. The building, 
dubbed Citizen360 because its height will afford many residents an all-around view of

the neighborhood, will have 6,000 square feet of amenity space that ranges from music 
rehearsal and art rooms to a gym and children's play area. Apartments go on sale this 
fall, with pricing in the $1.3 million to over-$12 million ballpark.

"The site was highly undervalued because it was so far 
east, and there were no good transportation links, and 
people just weren't interested or willing to go there. 
But we saw opportunity," says Barbara van Beuren, 
Anbau's managing director. "I think the absolute prices 
are manageable. This is not a building full of $10 
million apartments." Still, it points to a future far more 
expensive than the current data shows. 
Just one block from 113-year-old Jewish bakery 
Glaser's, which churns out delicious black-and-white 
cookies, Citizen360's shimmery facade will rise 410 feet 
above street level. But trumping them all will be DDG's 
under-construction goliath on 180 E. 88th St. At 521 
feet, it will be the tallest structure on the Upper East 
Side north of 72nd Street. Its 48 apartments with 16-
foot ceilings and custom lobby artwork launch sales this 
fall, with two-beds starting from $3.4 million, three-
beds from $4.5 million and four-beds from $7 million. 
It's not all about living among the clouds, though. 
Michael D'Alessio, president of Michael Paul 
Enterprises, oversaw the overhaul of two smallish 
rental buildings east of Third Avenue into boutique luxury projects. "They were prime 
locations for condominiums catering to families," says D'Alessio of the projects, 225 E. 
81st St. (a.k.a The Justin) and 554 E. 82nd St., which have nine apartments between 
them. "They are three or four bedroom units, with big living and dining areas with 
fireplaces, and they all have outdoor space." Six have been snatched up, with asks 
ranging from $2.25 million for a two-bedroom to $5.99 million for a four-bedroom.

Meanwhile, another rental-to-condo conversion — Carnegie Park — attracted first-
time buyer Elizabeth Dean, who realized Yorkville offered more bang for her buck after 
house-hunting in lower Manhattan. 
"Originally, I wasn't going to go north of 86th Street. I didn't know what was above 
there," says Dean, 29, who works in finance, paid $1,184 per square foot for her one-

bedroom and loves the restaurants, bars and grocery stores that dot the area

In July, StreetEasy reports Yorkville's median 
price per square foot was $1,098, up 5.1 
percent from the year prior and a whopping 
29.8 percent from the month prior. The Upper 
East Side as a whole, of course, boasts a 
higher median: $1,694 per square foot in July. 
"It'll actually be a great investment," Dean 
says. "Downtown is extremely pricey, and I 
think there's a lot more upside to the Upper 
East Side." 
Part of Carnegie Park's makeover includes a 
slate of plush amenities designed by classicist 
Robert A.M. Stern, the architect behind 
famously ritzy buildings like 15 Central Park West. (The pool, the roof deck and the in-
house "mini-Equinox" gym lured Dean.) Available apartments range from a $955,000 
one-bedroom to a $7.15 million penthouse.

the rendering.)

Stern is also working on a ground-up project at 20 East End Avenue that could pass as 
a setback-laden prewar, with old-school details like a porte-cochere, which allows 
residents to enter in a vehicle via an archway from the street and drive right up to the 
lobby door in a circular motor court. One of these hasn't been a part of any newly 
constructed building since the 1930s! About half of its 43 condos, spread across 18 
stories, are in contract from $4.49 million to $14.25 million. 
Still, three-fourths of New York City residents are renters, and the Upper East Side's 
new crop of construction has something for them, too. Related has topped out on a 36-
story tower at 205 E. 92nd St., where a playground used to sit. The uber-fancy 
development will have a massive two-story Equinox gym and a private school for kids 
with language-based learning disabilities on its lower floors.

The apartments above, set for completion and leasing in the spring of 2016, will have 
layouts that skew in favor of three- and four-bedrooms. "There will be thermostats 
programmable remotely on all the A/C units, and motorized shades in some of the 
units," says Bryan Cho, executive vice president at Related Companies. "From the 
marble bathrooms to the highly designed public spaces and the amenities, it's what's 
usually in condominiums." 
On the rental market sooner is The Rose Modern, a 20-story, 82-unit tower currently 
finishing up construction on York Avenue. The leasing office will open the first week of 
October offering "competitive" rents for a luxury building, according to Bond New 
York's Douglas Wagner, with move-ins slated for November and December.

Want to buy now, and move in immediately? The building most ahead of the curve is 
The Charles. Previously stalled after 2008's downturn, the 32-story condo at 1355 First 
Ave. got redesigned to emphasize large full-floor apartments before breaking ground 
in 2012. And it's paid off. There are four units left out of 27 total, which started at 
$5.97 million. A recent sale of the top six floors to two unidentified relatives for a total 
of $59 million made headlines. That price? On First Avenue?

garage, 302 E. 96th St. will become 
a 21-story luxury condo.

"The preconceived idea of what was considered prime and where you would build 
luxury has completely changed," says Jason Karadus of Town, who is director of sales 
for the Charles along with Ginger Brokaw. "A lot of people in the industry smirked at 
the pricing — about $2,500 per square foot ... Now it's not so risky, which is why you're 
seeing companies like Extell building up what's left to be developed up there." 
Every developable parcel seems to be getting snatched 
up. Just take a three-story garage on 302 East 96th 
Street, which developer Wonder Works bought in March 
for $24 million. On the northernmost border with 
Harlem, the developer plans to put up a 21-story, 48-
unit "affordable luxury" condo building — basically 
right on the approach to the FDR. (Don't worry, the 
facade will have extra soundproofing.) 
"The Second Avenue subway station for 96th street, 
which will be one of the first ones opened, is just 200 
feet away," says Eric Brody, Wonder Works' managing 
partner, who adds that brokers are recommending 
asking prices of $1,500 to $2,300 per square foot when 
units go on sale next year. "The buyer is anyone who 
can't afford to be in all these downtown neighborhoods, 
but still wants to live in the city and have incredibly 
close access to a train." 
Public transit of the future is why Andrew Ellis bought 
a fixer-upper on 95th Street and Second Avenue in 
2013. The 31-year-old consultant paid a mere $430 per 
square foot for a one-bedroom garden-level duplex. 
Then came a massive year-long renovation that updated the windows and kitchen 
appliances. He also completely redid the backyard, adding a rear deck and koi pond. In 
Yorkville, Ellis discovered a "neighborhood feel" that was a far cry from the raucous 
scrum of Murray Hill, where he had been renting. 
"I had sort of grown out of that," says Ellis, who is no longer alone in his move uptown. 
"My high school friends and some college friends are migrating to the Upper East Side. 
One is two doors down, literally, and two others are a few blocks away. Having that 
subway there eventually is really what did it for me. This place can only go up." 
Andrew Ellis stands in his Yorkville backyard, which he completely redid, adding a deck (so that the outdoor 
space was accessible from the upstairs living room of the duplex) and a koi pond.
