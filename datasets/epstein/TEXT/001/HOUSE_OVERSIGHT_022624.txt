Disgusting: Clinton Snared In Pedophile Ring 
Will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Kris Zane — March 27, 2014  
According to former child sex slave Virginia Roberts and a class action lawsuit against convicted billionaire 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, former President Bill Clinton was present during sex parties involving up to twenty 
underage girls at Epstein's secluded island in the Caribbean. That flight records show Clinton was flown on 
numerous occasions to the island on Epstein's private jet. Clinton had a close relationship with an employee of 
Epstein's who compiled thousands of photos of nude young girls posed in lewd positions. And these photos 
were used as a catalog for Epstein to loan out his girls to powerful politicians and British royalty, including Bill 
Clinton. 
According to the lawsuit:  
Advertisement-content continues below 
...Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who "kept images of naked underage children on her computer, 
helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in sexually explicit 
poses." 
While Epstein was indicted and jailed for his pedophilia, Bill Clinton oddly has remained unscathed, more than 
likely by having friends in high places. 
If Bill Clinton is in fact a pedophile, will the American people demand that he be put away for a very long time 
so that he can't hurt any more children? Or will having friends in high places exempt him from the rule of law? 
Time will tell.

Like some of the people stated when he was caught "playing" with Monica......he's just a man. Media blew it 
off, the Demons yelled about going after him just because he was a Demon. I don't think THIS will be "told" to 
the people, especially by the media. Don't want to make this man's wife look bad. Then, remember how "slick" 
asked for the meaning of "is" and "sex." Demons can be some of the most vile and ugly people on the 
planet.......

I am so sick of everyone acting like the Clinton's and even the Kennedy's are royalty. They are just a bunch of

be in jail too where he belongs.

And? What will happen? What WILL happen and what SHOULD happen are two different things. The 
lamestream media will never cover this story. Nothing will come of it. To the left, this is just a ho-hum blip. i'll 
be mega-surprised if Reuters even blinks and puts it on an inside back page. The AP won't touch it... so? i 
don't see it making an impact on the Hill's run — not when the media will treat it as a yawner. As a former CPS

They do not call him "slick" willy for nothing. Short of an actual photograph or video of him engaging in sex 
with a child there is no way he will get this pinned on him. Just remember how many people (40-50) connected 
to him and "her" that have lost their lives (murdered) and he's never been prosecuted. 
As much as I would like to see him and his carpet munching wife brought down it is just not going to happen, at 
least this way it's not...

Yeah... lets put that one right over there with the mythical Obama impeachment.What is more likely is that 
NAMBLA now has a new champion and this might become part of the kickstart to force Americans to tolerate 
yet another class of pervert. You don't have to be "religious" to know a pervert when you see one.

This self proved scumbag was impeached as President but got off and he will this time too. The left has so 
utterly turned us into a valueless and degenerate society and is determined to destroy what little of decency is 
left that he will NEVER be held either responsible or accountable for his sins. We have a criminally complicit 
Congress which has allowed the rule of law to cease to matter and when the time comes when they NEED it for 
their OWN SELF PRESERVATION, it will not be available even to them. As they have sown, so shall they 
reap! Between them, The Clintons are the perfect example of what is wrong with the Country at large and one 
of the major reasons we are now stuck with one worse and a set of political parasites who enable HIM to barter 
our freedoms, sovereignty and resources to our enemies. We have a word for those. You all know what it is but 
few in this country call them what they are, not only violators of their sworn oaths of Office but: TRAITORS. 
This one also happens to be apparently, according to this reference, a pedophile. will wonders never Cease or 
for that matter, CEASE TO DISGUST?

CAN ANYONE IMAGINE THE SECOND HALF OF THIS CRIMINAL DUO BEING "PRESIDENT OF

A FEW "GOOD DEMS" ARRESTED THIS WEEK, CALIFORNIA NORTH CAROLINA, 4 OR 5 BLACKS

THE CROOKED ATTORNEY(?) THINKS IT WOULD BE "RACIST" AND SAID "NO". (DEMS SURE

This is true, but is not limited to Bill Clinton or the Democrats. It permeates the top levels of most, if not all 
govts, as well as the Vatican, and includes all parties. Watch the following documentary prepared by the BBC 
for The Discovery Channel. It was pulled at the last moment due to pressure from high levels of the US govt.

If this is true then it is truly disgusting. That being said, after reading the comments section most of you need to 
get off of your republican high horse. Many republican politricksters have also been embroiled in sex scandals, 
some of them with minors, and some with underage boys. Now before the vains start popping out of your neck 
causing you to respond to me in all caps calling some sort of commie democrat leftist, realize that I hate the 
democrats just as much as I hate the republicans. In fact let's just call them the demublicans or the republicrats, 
whatever your pleasure. Most of you need to realize it's not about the ideology of one party or the other, it's 
about the ideology of power. These politricksters, all of them more stinking rich than average Joe American, get 
in the insulated world of political power and get a sense of invincibility and entitlement. They don't care about 
you or me, not a single one of them. But, as long as we keep seeing each other as the enemy rather than realize 
that they are the real enemy bent on destroying this country and the world then we, our children, and our 
grandchildren are doomed. 
Below is a link to federal sex scandals perpetrated by republicrats and demublicans alike. Keep in mind that this 
list does not include local and state level scandals.

like a God almost. He perhaps fed her lies and lured her to his den. It's not hard to imagine the senario...

Clinton is a low life scum sucking child molester! He's a disgrace to the human race. His wife is no better, as 
she allowed 4 of our patriots to be murdered without sending help when they pleaded for it.

Tonistimmel, yes, the Secret Service guards the president. Today I question the sense of honor and/or discretion 
of all politicians and government officials. This is no longer the America we were brought up in. And, I am not 
sure any of them have those qualities, or good intentions they once had.

Rocquedog, the latest info is that Chelsea is not slicks daughter, but is the daughter of Webb Hubbell: 
http ://www.mo fop olitics .com/2013/08/23/the-clintons-greatest-shame-chelsea-clinton-is-the-biological-
daughter-of-webb-hubbell/. As for Benghazi, I watched the whole thing go down, as I was online when the first 
call for help came in. At the time, they claimed that the attack was because of an anti Islamic video. All the 
while, unbeknown to us, we were giving the Syrian Rebels arms, which had already been infiltrated by Al 
Nursa/A1 Qaeda. In order to keep it all under wraps, Benghazi took care of all credible witnesses. IMHO.

Rocquedog, I agree he is a low life, and Hillary is just as bad. Her relationship with Huma Abedine and 
Anthony Weiner leaves room for many questions. Weiner is runner up to slick Willy on preying on young 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022642 
women, and Hillarys relationship with Huma is suspicious to say the least. Birds of a feather? Or should I say 
perverts of feather?

99AIRFORCE, yes I do remember the white water land scandal, and you are correct about the outcome. If 
anyone has any questions concerning this, the following site gives the information. They were criminals, and I 
still do not understand how slick Willy was not considered so at the time of his nomination.

Bill Clinton has had a sexual problem for his entire life. People like the Clintons, Obamas, Bidens, Reids, 
Schumers, Boehners, Bushs, etc. can willingly, knowingly, & intentionally commit crimes with no recourse. 
The U.S. Supreme Court rules Obamacare is a tax, Most likely will make Hobby Lobby & similar companies do 
what they are morally against, Will likely ultimately rule to enact strict gun control laws if not an outright ban, 
Allow open boarders, & Immigrants. They always rule in the gov'ts favor. Rarely for the citizenship any longer. 
If the Constitution is ever amended and/or rewrote which they are in favor of they need to be given term & 
power limits. They are the Supreme Power of this Nation and have proven to be a bunch of decrepit buffoons.

BOBMAN101, I sure hope so, this subject is outrageous, and I don't know where the minds of these people are. 
A pedophile ring is beyond my scope of understanding, and about one of the worst things that could ever be 
considered acceptable. It is an extremely important issue, and I sure don't want it to escape full coverage by the 
media.

No more Clintons or Bushes, ever again! The White House is going to have to be fumigated as it is. After the 
string of disgusting excuses for human beings we've had for Presidents, maybe we should just raze it and 
rebuild. Slick Willy and Killary should both be in prison. Instead they're adored by their disgusting supporters. 
Anyone that would support or even associate with these scum must be of the same caliber.

The hate "W" machine is still running in spite of the fact that "W" was a better president than Clinton and 
Obozo and their combinatuion. I realize that being better than those two is no real accomplishment, but "W" at 
least made the list of good presidents, may be not excellent, and definitely not great, a whole lot more than 
acceptible.

Call it paranoid, call it conspiracy theory, call it what you watch. I wouldn't be one bit surprised to find out that 
there is/are a puppet master/group of puppet masters in the shadows pushing these douche bag politicians at us 
and giving us the illusion that there is a difference in their politics and philosophies when in reality they are all 
the same just doing their master's biding. They will push this liberal agenda just far enough to the edge of the 
cliff then pull back and give us back the conservative government so we can take retributions on the liberals for 
their treasonous behavior. Heads will roll, asses will get kicked, gays & blacks will once again be of no 
consequence and the illegals will be run out of the country. Once things have calmed down, they will change 
the politics again and the beat goes on.

We knew this when Monica Lewinski "with the Blue Dress with the Semen on it" exposed Billy Clinton, in the 
White Hoer House in DC, he had a B.J. with Monica Under the Desk in the Oval Office when he was 
impeached, but the Nat See Senate would not convict the Pedophile mur-derer of Vince Foster. 
But we see with the new charges coming against the Felon, Hairy Reid, who takes Bribes and Steals as the 
DemoNatSee Leader of the Nat See Controlled Senate. 
All DemoFascistCrats are Lawless and EVIL. 
To think that Ronald Reagan would not remove his Suite Jacket in the Oval Office because he had such respect 
and Admiration of the Oval Office. And the DemoNatSees/Fascists/Marxist/Muslims now in the White House 
Suck...

The girls listed here (well not here, in an article longer than a twitter post) are of age in every European country, 
and Canada. Just like age of drinking, you guys are the anomaly with a higher degree of repression in all social 
areas. 
The reason for that is the crazy -ass, hate spewing, xenophobic, ignorant political bandwagons and scape-
goating your society is rife with. Right now you're trying to figure out how you can blame this on Obama aren't 
you? Yeah I know. Obama. His fault. Somehow. (Actually several posts already are) 
That said, yeah he's stupid. He should follow the laws of his own country. If that's your laws he should be 
following them. 
However, nobody here has the slightest friggen idea if any of this is the least bit true, but you're already 
forming the lynch mobs. 
It's not because you're really upset about the issue at hand. It's hatred of your fat and miserable existence, your 
subscription and indoctrination in to disgusting and brutal pseudo-religious political beliefs, and your lazy 
inability to fact check a thing for yourself when you find it so much easier to ride on a bandwagon. 
Search "consistency theory", if you can handle all the big words and ideas, and you'll figure out why you are 
unable to learn and grow as people. 
I swear most of you can't create or express an idea without it being ascribed to a political view.

Huh? Wha? I'm figuring you're not an American citizen. You "bunched" up all into a group that you describe 
with some wonderful words. Maybe YOU know the WHOLE TRUTH, there are plenty who recall how a newly 
elected President had to give MONEY to a couple of women who had been "assaulted" by this scum bag. Check 
the news papers.......no not twitter.......Maybe you don't know about the "White Water" scandal or about 
Vince Foster, who "shot" himself in the RIGHT side of his head; the man must have been so depressed he used 
his "off' hand to pull the trigger. Maybe his left hand just shook too much. The "Monica" escapade was just a 
man having a fling with a silly woman, makes no mind the woman was the same age as his daughter. HE LIED 
UNDER OATH TO A FEDERAL JUDGE. He stood in front of the entire country and stated "he did not have 
sex with that woman." As for political view points.......isn't that how governments are elected? I don't know 
what country you live in, but here we like to THINK before voting, OOPS! I mean generally; right now there 
are too damn many NON thinking casting ballots. That's how we got slick and now Obummer.

validate their self-worth, and realises within themselves that this label doesn't apply to them.

I find the funniest thing is the word "Choice" has been taken over by the pro-abortion mob, and the stupid 
people of the former united States don't have any choice, anymore, period. 
If we had a smidgen of Choice anymore, the Clintons would be whining about getting paroled from their 
original prison sentences for wasting Vince Foster — on, get this, humanitarian grounds. 
We have no choice. All you have to do is open your eyes and you'll see that we're still nothing but the serfs 
who pay for the daily antics of the lords. Nothing has changed.

I'm not surprised that a proven serial-rapist, murderer and drug trafficker would also be a pedophile. The leader 
of the administration before his, yes that guy, was also linked to a pedophile prostitution ring uncovered in the 
Franklin pedophile investigation. Research it; and also the name Johnny Gosh. It's a fascinating true story.

The clintons are just evil vial people and I am not surprised about this at all. Also there was a comment asking 
about the ages of those girls involved? "Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who "kept images of 
naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed 
underage females in sexually explicit poses." 
Read more at http://www.westernj ournalism.com/clinton-snared-pedophile-ring/#PkFfaxkTOIMkgS1.99  
Pretty much covers that they were in fact underage children. Makes me sick to my stomach and would love to 
see "old icky billy" get his just reward but doubt it as the article also states, "because of friends in High Places".

Subject: Filing in Epstein case 
Hi Prof. Dershowitz: 
I've been following the Jeffrey Epstein litigation saga on and off for some time. 
When I checked the federal court docket last night, I came across the attached filing. It makes some serious 
allegations about you and several other people related to the case. 
I wanted to make sure you had a copy of the filing and to ask if you have any comments on the allegations 
raised in it. 
I'm planning to write a blog entry or story on this and will probably do so fairly soon since the filing is a 
public record at this point. 
Anyway, if you want to respond, please let me know as soon as possible. 
Thanks
