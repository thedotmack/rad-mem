Is Clinton willing to say he was not there? Btw, I've just filed a column for USA Today for Monday explaining 
how Dershowitz and Andrew allegations were picked up from unverified civil court docs, transferred to UK 
tabs, which go wild because of no libel rules on U.S. court papers, and then translated back here as "reported 
fact." Problem with story is that tabs are too invested in present story line, and unlikely that the Times 
or WSJ will want to touch it--tho, depending on who is willing to on record, they might. There is another 
politico reporter I know who might do it, again, if the on-the-record sources are public people. Or, I will use it 
for New York Magazine, but that won't be until Feb. Can you still talk tomorrow? When works? Woody and 
Soon-Yi coming for dinner tonight. m
