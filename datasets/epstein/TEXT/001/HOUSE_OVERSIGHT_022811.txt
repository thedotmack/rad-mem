David BoiesDavid Boies, Boies Schiller Flexner 
Diego M. Radzinschi/The National Law Journal  

 
“Jane Doe 43″ has formally identified herself as Sarah Ransome in a sexual trafficking lawsuit that her lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner are pursuing against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
 
In a notice to change the case caption filed Friday in Manhattan federal court, Ransome’s attorneys said she “no longer intends to proceed by way of pseudonym” in the case, which claims Epstein forced her to have sex for money.
 
Defense lawyers for Epstein had argued that Ransome must litigate under her own name after she wrote a Nov. 15 letter to The New York Times, which the Times published, in which she defended Boies Schiller and firm chairman David Boies against criticism stemming from Boies’ work for Harvey Weinstein.
 
Ransome identified herself as Jane Doe 43 in the Times letter, which said Boies “heard me and came to my rescue” when others refused to take her allegations against Epstein seriously. “For the first time in 10 years I finally feel safe because of David Boies and his colleagues,” wrote Ransome, who also said the firm did not charge her legal fees.
 
The letter was prompted by a Nov. 9 Times op-ed by Stanford University law professor Deborah Rhode, titled “David Boies’s Egregious Involvement With Harvey Weinstein.” Written in the wake of revelations in The New Yorker that Boies had engaged private investigators to kill an investigation by Times reporters into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predations, the op-ed suggested that Boies’ work for Weinstein was unethical, partly because the Times’ was a Boies Schiller client.
 
Two days earlier, on Nov. 7, following publication of The New Yorker article, Boies had issued a statement addressed to his firm, stating that Weinstein was no longer a client and stressing that he “would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women or anyone else.”
 
In a Nov. 21 brief in the Epstein litigation, defense lawyer Michael Miller of Steptoe & Johnson LLP argued that Ransome had never satisfied requirements to file anonymously and had publicly identified herself with her letter to the Times, so she should be required to add her name to the case caption.
 
Sigrid McCawley, a Boies Schiller partner in the firm’s Fort Lauderdale office who represents Ransome along with Boies and others, said her client ultimately chose to go public with her name “in the hopes that her courage will inspire other Epstein victims to speak their truth.”
 
In 2008, Epstein entered a guilty plea in Florida for soliciting an underage prostitute, which led to an 18-month jail term and placement on the national sex offender registry. Since then, multiple plaintiffs have filed related complaints against him, including one that includes allegations that President Donald Trump’s winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, was the location of events that led to sex trafficking.
 
Epstein has argued that the court should dismiss the case because Ransome failed to state a substantiated claim and because the claims she makes are barred by the statute of limitations.
 
Steptoe’s Miller had no immediate comment for this report.

While you are busy working toward that six-pack, being more mindful, or learning a new language, why not commit to trying something new at your law firm or department?

   David Boies, Boies Schiller Flexner 
Diego M. Radzinschi/The National Law Journal  

 
“Jane Doe 43″ has formally identified herself as Sarah Ransome in a sexual trafficking lawsuit that her lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner are pursuing against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
 
In a notice to change the case caption filed Friday in Manhattan federal court, Ransome’s attorneys said she “no longer intends to proceed by way of pseudonym” in the case, which claims Epstein forced her to have sex for money.
 
Defense lawyers for Epstein had argued that Ransome must litigate under her own name after she wrote a Nov. 15 letter to The New York Times, which the Times published, in which she defended Boies Schiller and firm chairman David Boies against criticism stemming from Boies’ work for Harvey Weinstein.
 
Ransome identified herself as Jane Doe 43 in the Times letter, which said Boies “heard me and came to my rescue” when others refused to take her allegations against Epstein seriously. “For the first time in 10 years I finally feel safe because of David Boies and his colleagues,” wrote Ransome, who also said the firm did not charge her legal fees.
 
The letter was prompted by a Nov. 9 Times op-ed by Stanford University law professor Deborah Rhode, titled “David Boies’s Egregious Involvement With Harvey Weinstein.” Written in the wake of revelations in The New Yorker that Boies had engaged private investigators to kill an investigation by Times reporters into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predations, the op-ed suggested that Boies’ work for Weinstein was unethical, partly because the Times’ was a Boies Schiller client.
 
Two days earlier, on Nov. 7, following publication of The New Yorker article, Boies had issued a statement addressed to his firm, stating that Weinstein was no longer a client and stressing that he “would never knowingly participate in an effort to intimidate or silence women or anyone else.”
 
In a Nov. 21 brief in the Epstein litigation, defense lawyer Michael Miller of Steptoe & Johnson LLP argued that Ransome had never satisfied requirements to file anonymously and had publicly identified herself with her letter to the Times, so she should be required to add her name to the case caption.
 
Sigrid McCawley, a Boies Schiller partner in the firm’s Fort Lauderdale office who represents Ransome along with Boies and others, said her client ultimately chose to go public with her name “in the hopes that her courage will inspire other Epstein victims to speak their truth.”
 
In 2008, Epstein entered a guilty plea in Florida for soliciting an underage prostitute, which led to an 18-month jail term and placement on the national sex offender registry. Since then, multiple plaintiffs have filed related complaints against him, including one that includes allegations that President Donald Trump’s winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, was the location of events that led to sex trafficking.
 
Epstein has argued that the court should dismiss the case because Ransome failed to state a substantiated claim and because the claims she makes are barred by the statute of limitations.
 
Steptoe’s Miller had no immediate comment for this report.
