Importance: High 
very well, my reputation has admittedly taken a hit. however, again, more calls re currency than i can 
handle. in addition I am considering a statement and positon that Out of respect and love for my former 
girlfrend I have tried to keep her out of my mess. she was never questioned, or subpeonaed. her name never 
surfaced.. I thought it right as a friend to protect her name. however during the entire time she 
was my serious girlfriend. She traveled with me almost everywhere, each house, she is on the plane many 
many times. she knew and remembers She never saw anything that claims. She can 
confirm 1. I was never alone at the house. staff, friends etc. , no girl ever complained, not once. 2. jane doe 
1 and 2 , were local strippers, that would call all the time asking if they could do massages. . . they left message 
after message. 3. We had a serious love relationship, I had promised her not to involve her in my story as it 
was so sordid. . she was 22 - 24 at the time. . 4 she has photos after photos showing we were together. . 5 she 
knows clinton was never on the island. 6 she knows no sex with steven hawking, she knows no sex with ehud 
as he was also never on the island. 6 she is 38 years old now and presentable. . 7 She woudl acknowledge that 
these girls asked to bring their friends . many of their best friends sat in the kitchen while they gave 
massages outside on the terrace. ( no sex J. . they certainly looked over age. nevr heard anyone say 
otherwise. , Jeffrey never asked for underage, that is crazy, . . 8. answered the phones. served 
coffee. . there were many massage people , men women, aged up to 60.
