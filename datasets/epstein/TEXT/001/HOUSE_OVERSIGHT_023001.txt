For years, Jeffrey Epstein abused teen girls, police say. A 
timeline of his case 
PERVERSION 
ofJUSTIC 
A decade before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the 
ultimate break. 
2005 
March: A 14-year-old girl and her parents report that Jeffrey Epstein molested her 
at a mansion in Palm Beach. She said a female acquaintance and classmate at Royal 
Palm Beach High School had taken her to the house to give him a massage in 
exchange for money. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023002 
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with underage girls at his 
waterfront Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way, according to police in the Town of 
Palm Beach. Epstein also owns residences in New York City and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, among other locales. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
April: Palm Beach police begin trash pulls at Epstein's home, discovering a 
telephone message for Epstein with the girl's name on it, and a time that matched 
the time that she told police she was there. They find the names and phone numbers 
of other girls on message slips in his trash. 
October: With the police probe in full swing, one of Epstein's assistants calls one of 
the girls just as she is being questioned by police. Investigators begin interviewing 
more girls, as well as Epstein's butlers, who tell them that Epstein had frequent 
visits from girls throughout the day. On Oct. 20, they execute a search warrant at his 
house on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach. 
2006 
May: Police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his 
assistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. The Palm Beach 
state attorney, Barry Krischer, instead refers the case to a grand jury. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023003

Palm Beach police were unhappy with the handling of the Epstein case by then-State 
Attorney Barry Krischer. 
June: The grand jury, after hearing from only one girl, returns an indictment of one 
count of solicitation of prostitution. The charge does not reflect that the victim in 
question and others were minors. 
July: Epstein's powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State 
Attorney's Office. Lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution in which Epstein would 
enter a pretrial intervention program and serve no jail time. 
July: After pressure from the Palm Beach police chief, the FBI opens a federal 
investigation, dubbed "Operation Leap Year." Documents list the possible crime as 
"child prostitution." 
November: The FBI begins interviewing potential witnesses and victims from 
Florida, New York and New Mexico. 
2007 
May: As the U.S. Attorney's Office prepares to present the case to a federal grand 
jury, Epstein's attorneys request a meeting to discuss the investigation. 
June: A 53-page indictment is prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office as, 
simultaneously, plea negotiations are initiated with Epstein's legal team. 
July: Grand jury subpoenas are issued for Epstein's computers, which were 
apparently removed from his Palm Beach home prior to the police search. 
August: The U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, enters into direct 
discussions about the plea agreement; a motion to compel production of Epstein's 
computers is delayed. 
September: Federal prosecutors draw up several federal plea agreements that are 
rejected by Epstein and his attorneys. Epstein signs a non-prosecution agreement 
on Sept. 24, but his attorneys continue to delay his court appearance. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023005 
Alexander Acosta has been criticized for his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case as 
U.S. attorney. He later became the dean of Florida International University's law 
school and, later still, President Trump's secretary of labor. Miami Herald file photo 
October: With the non-prosecution agreement still being debated, Acosta meets 
with Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz at the West Palm Beach Marriott on Okeechobee 
Road to discuss finalizing a deal. Among the terms agreed upon: that the victims 
would not be notified, that the deal would be kept under seal and all grand jury 
subpoenas would be canceled. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023006 
The Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach, at 1001 Okeechobee Blvd., is where U.S. 
Attorney Alexander Acosta met with Jeffrey Epstein's attorney to work out a plea 
arrangement. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
November: Epstein's lawyers object to an addendum to the agreement. The 
provision called for a special master to appoint an attorney to represent Epstein 
victims' rights to civil compensation. 
December: The two sides continue to debate the addendum. Epstein attorney 
Kenneth Starr asks for a review of the agreement by the U.S. Department of Justice 
in Washington, further delaying its execution. Victims are told the investigation is 
continuing. 
2008 
January: Epstein attorney, Lefkowitz, calls Acosta, telling him his client will not go 
through with the agreement because it requires him to register as a sex offender. 
February: With the plea negotiations and the Justice Department review still in 
limbo, the FBI continues its probe, locating more witnesses and evidence. 
March: Preparations are made for a new federal grand jury presentation. In court 
documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office notes that Epstein's victims are being 
harassed by his lawyers, who are not specifically named. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023007 
May: The Justice Department issues finding that, if a plea deal is not reached, 
Epstein can be federally prosecuted. 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
June: Epstein's lawyers revisit plea negotiations, and on June 30, Epstein appears 
in a Palm Beach County courtroom. He pleads guilty to state charges: one count of 
solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor 
under the age of 18. He is sentenced to 18 months in jail, followed by a year of 
community control or house arrest. He is adjudicated as a convicted sex offender 
who must register twice a year in Florida. 
July: Epstein's victims learn about his plea in state court after the fact. They file an 
emergency petition to force federal prosecutors to comply with the federal Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, which mandates certain rights for crime victims, including the 
right to be informed about plea agreements and the right to appear at sentencing. 
August: Epstein's victims learn that he has already been sent to jail, and that the 
federal investigation is over. They seek to have his plea agreement unsealed, but 
federal prosecutors argue against releasing the agreement, commencing a yearlong 
court battle to learn the terms of Epstein's plea bargain. 
October: Epstein begins work release from the county stockade. He is picked up by 
his private driver six days a week and transported to an office in West Palm Beach, 
where he accepts visitors for up to 12 hours a day. He returns to the stockade in the 
evenings to sleep.

The Miami Herald obtained thousands of FBI and court records, lawsuits, and 
witness depositions, and went to federal court in New York to access sealed 
documents in the reporting of "Perversion of Justice." The Herald also tracked down 
more than 6o women who said they were victims, some of whom had never spoken 
of the abuse before.

2009 
July: Epstein is released from the Palm Beach County stockade, five months early. 
He must register as a sex offender and is on probation for a year, confined to his 
Palm Beach home except to travel to his office in West Palm Beach. However, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023008 
records show he frequently makes trips to Manhattan and to his home in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. 
August: Palm Beach Police Capt. George Frick finds Epstein walking along AiA in 
the middle of the afternoon, when he was supposed to be at work in his office in 
downtown West Palm Beach. Epstein says he is walking to work, even though the 
location where he is found is not a direct route to his office. His probation officer 
says Epstein has permission to get some exercise. 
September: The federal non-prosecution agreement is made public. By 
September, at least a dozen civil lawsuits have been filed by women who allege they 
were molested by Epstein when they were underage. Epstein begins the process of 
settling them out of court.

Jeffrey Epstein never went to federal prison but his butler/houseman, Alfredo 
Rodriguez, did, for obstruction of justice. He was busted for hiding Epstein's journal 
and trying to sell it. He has since died. © Facebook 
November: One of Epstein's former butlers tries to sell to an undercover FBI agent 
a black book filled with the names of hundreds of girls and young women that 
Epstein allegedly procured for sex and massages. The butler tells FBI agents he 
witnessed nude underage girls at Epstein's pool and had known that the millionaire 
was having sex with them. He also said he saw pornography involving underage girls 
on Epstein's computers. The butler/houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, is later charged 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023010 
with obstruction of justice and sentenced to federal prison. He dies in 2015. The 
contents of the black book become public as part of several civil lawsuits. 
2010 
April: Flight logs obtained as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein show an 
assortment of politicians, academics, celebrities, heads of state and world leaders 
flying on Epstein's jets in the early 2000s. Among them: former President Bill 
Clinton, former national security adviser Sandy Berger, former Colombian President 
Andres Pastrana and lawyer Alan Dershowitz. 
2011 
March: Two of Epstein's victims file a motion in federal court accusing the 
government of violating their rights by failing to notify them about the plea deal and 
keeping it secret. Among other things, they want the plea deal invalidated in the 
hopes of sending Epstein to prison. They accuse federal prosecutors of deceiving 
them with "false notification letters." 
September: U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rejects the U.S. Attorney's Office 
argument that it was under no obligation to notify victims prior to striking a non-
prosecution agreement with Epstein because there were no federal charges filed 
against him. The decision marks a victory for Epstein's victims, but the case will 
drag on for seven more years. 
November: Epstein must register in New York as the highest and most dangerous 
level of sex offender, despite efforts by him and the New York District Attorney's 
office to lower the classification. A Level 3 status means "high risk of repeat offense 
and a threat to public safety exists," according to the state's guidelines. 
2012 
March-December: Calling himself a "celebrated philanthropist" and a "renowned 
educational investor," Epstein undertakes a public relations campaign to counter 
bad press about his sexual exploits. His foundation donates millions to scientific 
research and sponsors global conferences on ways to achieve world peace and save 
the planet. He funds cancer and educational research projects around the country. 
2015 
Virginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a 
masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a 
life of depravity and sexual abuse. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023011 
January: Virginia Roberts files court papers in Florida claiming that she was 
forced by Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz when 
she was underage. In a sworn affidavit, she provides photographs of her with the 
prince and with Epstein's close associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She 
claims Maxwell worked as Epstein's madam, which she denies. Dershowitz and the 
prince deny her claims as well, setting off a series of legal actions between 
Dershowitz and Roberts' attorneys that are later resolved in an out-of-court 
settlement. 
April: A federal judge rules that Roberts cannot join the federal Crime Victims' 
Rights Act lawsuit and that her affidavit — accusing Prince Andrew and Dershowitz 
of having sex with her when she was underage — be stricken from the case. 
Dershowitz said the ruling meant he was vindicated. However, the judge does not 
address the veracity of Roberts' claims, writing: "The factual details regarding with 
whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and 
impertinent to this central claim." 
September: Roberts sues Maxwell in federal court in New York, claiming that 
Epstein's alleged madam defamed her in public statements in the media. The 
lawsuit is widely viewed as a vessel for Epstein's victims to expose the scope of 
Epstein's crimes. Several civil lawsuits filed the same year allege that Epstein and 
Maxwell operated an international sex trafficking operation.

Epstein. Her life had already been marred by sexual abuse even before she met the 
multimillionaire. Emily Michot emichotPmiamiherald.com  
2016 
June: A lawsuit is filed in Manhattan by a woman who once used the name Katie 
Johnson, claiming that she was raped by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump 
at a party at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 1994 when she was 13 years old. 
Trump and Epstein both categorically deny it ever happened.

'How in the world, do you, the U.S. attorney, engage in a negotiation with a criminal 
defendant, basically allowing that criminal defendant to write up the agreement?' 
said Bradley Edwards, shown here, who is representing some of the victims of serial 
sex abuser and Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Emily Michot 
emichotPmiamiherald.com  
November: Johnson backs out of a press conference just days before Election Day, 
saying she had been threatened and was fearful. She later drops the lawsuit. 
2017 
February: President Trump nominates former Miami federal prosecutor Acosta as 
U.S. secretary of labor. Acosta is compelled at his confirmation hearing to briefly 
address questions about the deal he approved for Epstein. One lawmaker requests 
more records from the Epstein case. Acosta is confirmed. 
June: Roberts settles her lawsuit with Maxwell for an undisclosed sum. 
2018 
December: Civil trial is scheduled in Palm Beach County Court on Bradley 
Edwards' allegations that Epstein sued him to punish him for representing several 
of his victims. The malicious-prosecution lawsuit is set to begin Dec. 4. Epstein has 
indicated he will not appear in court for trial. 
The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their 
cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023014 
employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have 
prospered.
