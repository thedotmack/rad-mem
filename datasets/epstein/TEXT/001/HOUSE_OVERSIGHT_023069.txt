Deep dive on corporate tax reform
OK, maybe it’s not as inevitable as death and taxes, but some form of corporate tax
reform seems likely. It is a stated priority of President Trump and has widespread
Congressional support. We here focus on four components that could have big equity
implications. We assess the impacts at a market, sector, and industry level, and plan to
update and augment this work as more details come to light.
Potential near-term boost to EPS, long-term impact varies
Our 2018 S&P 500 EPS estimate of $137 already implies healthy two-year growth of +16%.
Tax reform in its entirety could add as much as $5-6 to near-term EPS, as benefits are frontloaded.
The sustained impact depends: under a 20% tax rate, the Blueprint would be
modestly accretive; under a 15% rate, this annual benefit could triple; but a 25% tax rate that
would appease the deficit hawks could shave $3.50 off of earnings each year. We also
estimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS associated with the repatriation tax (Table 1).
Cutting corporate tax rate could add $8 to EPS
Our starting point is the US statutory corporate tax rate. If it were lowered from 35% to
20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits), it
would boost S&P 500 EPS by an estimated 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS). We assume
companies would be able to retain half of the benefit ($8) and the remainder would be
passed on to customers or competed away. For instance, a lasting impact to Utilities'
profits is unlikely, as the benefit would be passed on via regulated pricing.
Repatriation: Buybacks could boost EPS by 3%
Both Trump and the Blueprint support a mandatory (as opposed to 2004's optional) tax
of overseas earnings of US firms’ subsidiaries at reduced rates. Non-Financials in the S&P
hold at least $1.2tn in overseas cash (mostly Tech and Health Care). If half was used for
buybacks, this could add 3% ($4) to S&P 500 EPS. A redux of 2004 where companies
used 80% of cash for buybacks may be less likely, in our view. For if repatriation is
accompanied by an end to interest expense deductions, companies may choose to pay
down debt over buybacks.
Border adjustment tax (BAT) hits EPS by $5-6
While Trump has described the BAT as being “too complicated,” White House press
secretary Spicer’s recent comments call into question his stance. This is a key
component of the Blueprint and would generate significant revenue. First-order impacts
could be significant, with border adjustments detracting $5-6 from 2018 EPS — nearly
80% of the drag comes from the consumer sectors. The second order impacts — product
pricing, pricing within the supply chain, exchange rates, foreign policy reactions, etc. —
while harder to quantify, are important to consider.
End to interest deductibility could detract 4% from EPS
We estimate that over time, the removal of the interest expense deduction would
detract about 4% from S&P 500 EPS. An increase in the cost of debt by an incremental
25% could have longer term ramifications for capital structures and funding..
Tax reform winners and losers
We include stock screens for potential beneficiaries and victims of tax cuts, repatriation
and interest deductibility changes, as well as industries most helped/hurt most by a BAT.
Note that the very fact that there are companies and industries that have the potential
to be very negatively impacted could call into question the likelihood of passage.

The costs and benefits of tax reform
2017 could be a watershed year from a tax reform perspective. Trump has continuously
stated that tax reform is a priority, and there is evidence of widespread support in
Congress. Tax reform could be enacted through reconciliation without the risk of being
filibustered, suggesting the timing could be imminent. Corporate tax reform could have
a significant impact on S&P 500 earnings, corporate behavior and capital markets. Much
has been written on the timing, funding and process by which corporate tax reform
could be enacted. In this report, we use House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Blueprint proposal as
a starting point in quantifying the impact of corporate tax reform on the S&P 500, with
some scenario analysis to account for differences included in the final bill (such as
Trump’s proposals). Our analysis is focused specifically on the impact of corporate tax
reform, however we recognize that there are many other factors that can impact the
sensitivity analysis (e.g. changes to household income tax rates, infrastructure spending,
etc.).
We estimate that the Blueprint proposal would initially boost S&P 500 EPS by $5-6,
assuming the end of interest expense deductions only applies to new debt, or is phased
in over time. But the devil is in the details. Over time, the loss of the interest tax shield
would be a significant drag on earnings as existing debt is refinanced. Additionally, the
corporate tax rate is critical in determining whether or not the tax reform policies end
up being accretive to earnings on a sustained basis. We estimate that at the 20% tax
rate, the Blueprint would be modestly accretive, the benefit would triple under Trump’s
proposed 15% tax rate, but at a higher 25% tax rate that would appease the deficit
hawks in Congress, the benefit would turn to a negative over time (Table 2). We also
estimate a one-time $8-9 charge to GAAP EPS that would be associated with the
discounted repatriation tax.

In the following pages, we focus on the following topics that have large implications for
US equity investors, but it is important to consider corporate tax reform holistically
rather than drawing major implications from each measure in isolation:
• Reducing the US corporate tax rate
• Repatriation - mandatory tax on overseas profits
• Border adjustment tax
• Removal of interest expense deduction
The government revenue associated with each of these is included in the table below.

Cutting the corporate tax rate
The best starting point for analyzing corporate tax reform is the US statutory corporate
tax rate, as this rate is critical in determining the impact of other proposed changes
(border adjustments, interest deductibility, etc.). If the tax rate were lowered from 35%
to 20% and the US moved to a territorial tax system (no longer taxing foreign profits),
all else equal, we estimate an initial boost to S&P 500 EPS of 12% ($17 to 2018 EPS).
However, over time, some of this benefit could be passed on to customers via lower
prices — for instance, it is unlikely that there will be any major long-lasting impact from
tax reform for Utilities sector profits, as any benefit/cost would likely be passed through
to customers when incorporated into each company's regulated pricing. The benefit
would also be offset by some of the other changes discussed in subsequent sections.
We assume that S&P 500 companies would be able to retain half of the benefit, or
roughly $8 of 2018E EPS. Below, we show the estimated EPS impacts on each sector
based on a tax rate of 20%.

While the effective tax rate of the S&P 500 is generally about 28% (currently closer to
25% due to the recent commodity recession), we estimate that the tax rate for the S&P
500’s domestic operations is much higher at roughly 33% — although this includes
state and local taxes. If all companies with tax rates above the proposed new tax rate of
20% were to drop to 20%, and no companies provisioned for US taxes on foreign
profits, we estimate the domestic effective tax rate for the S&P 500 would fall in line
with its foreign tax rate of roughly 19%. This would represent a 9ppt decrease in the
current S&P 500 tax rate and a 12% increase in EPS. We show the sensitivity to S&P
500 EPS to different assumed tax rates in the chart below, but we reiterate that these
estimates exaggerate the actual impact on profits, as a significant portion of these
benefits would likely be passed on to consumers via lower prices. We assume that in
aggregate, roughly half of the gains from the lower tax rate would be retained (i.e. half
of the amounts shown in the sensitivity analysis in Chart 2).

Note: Our base case assumes that half of the benefit would be passed on to customers, competed
away or offset by other changes to the tax code. Thus, we would expect the uplift to our EPS forecast
to be roughly half the calculated benefit from simply lowering the corporate tax rate.
The market is beginning to price in the benefits of tax cuts , but we may still be in the
early days – note that potential beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus (i.e. infrastructure
spending) have seen an 18% multiple re-rating but de minimis fundamental support,
whereas potential beneficiaries of lower corporate tax rates have seen performance
driven nearly equivalently by multiples and earnings.

Repatriation
Repatriation likely under both Blueprint and Trump plans
Mandatory tax on overseas profits of 8.75% under Blueprint, 10% under Trump
The US currently operates under a tax system in which the domestic earnings of US
corporates are taxed at the federal US corporate rate (35%) and any overseas earnings
that are repatriated are taxed at this rate less a credit for foreign taxes paid on those
same earnings. Many multinationals’ foreign earnings thus remain parked offshore,
allowing corporations to avoid the tax hit associated with bringing them back to the US.
Both Trump and the House (under Ryan) have proposed a mandatory tax of overseas
earnings of US firms’ foreign subsidiaries at reduced rates, such that this cash can be
brought back and put to work in the US. This differs from the 2004 repatriation tax
holiday, which was optional.
Under the Blueprint, accumulated overseas earnings will be subject to a transition tax of
8.75% 1 (for those held in cash/cash equivalents) or 3.5% (for all other holdings), with
companies able to pay the tax liability over an eight-year period. This would be part of
broader tax reform, where a proposed territorial tax system would exempt companies’
foreign income from US taxes and prevent future buildup of overseas profits as
companies would be free to bring them home. Trump’s plan calls for a one-time deemed
repatriation of overseas corporate profits at a 10% tax rate.

The Tax Policy Center estimates that a repatriation tax holiday would generate
approximately $150bn in tax receipts under Trump’s plan (over 10 years) and $140bn
1
Note: The effective tax rates of 8.75% and 3.5% under the Blueprint are based on an allowable deduction of 75% (for
deferred earnings held in cash/liquid assets) or 90% (for the non-cash portion), with the remainder taxed at the US
corporate tax rate, i.e. 35%(1-75%) = 8.75% and 35%(1-90%) = 3.5%. This methodology was proposed by Dave Camp’s
(former chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means) Tax Reform Act of 2014.

under the Blueprint (over eight years). The Tax Foundation similarly estimates that a
repatriation act could drive spending amounting to $185-200bn in revenues through
2025, which could help fund infrastructure/defense spending.
S&P 500 companies could bring back over $1tn – mostly in Tech & Health Care
Our FX team has written that US corporates in aggregate (including Financials) hold
~$2tn in cash overseas, and their work suggests that nearly half is concentrated within
20 companies. Similarly, as we discuss below, half of the repatriated cash following the
2004 Homeland Investment Act came from just 15 companies, predominantly in Pharma
and Tech. Our own analysis of the S&P 500 (based on filings and estimates from our
analysts) suggests that non-Financials in the S&P hold approximately $1.2tn overseas,
nearly three-quarters of which is in Tech and Health Care (Chart 4).

Repatriation in context: a look back at 2004
The last repatriation holiday in the US was the Homeland Investment Act (HIA) of 2004
(part of the American Jobs Creation Act), which allowed for a one-time repatriation of
foreign earnings by US multinationals at a reduced effective tax rate of 5.25% (vs. the
statutory 35% rate), based on an allowable exemption of 85% of foreign earnings from
US taxes (35% x [1-85%] = 5.25%). This deduction could be claimed in the tax year
beginning before or after the passage date in Oct. 2004. Approximately $300bn was
repatriated, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)’s U.S. International
Transactions Accounts Data, vs. an average of $60bn over the prior five years. The IRS
estimates 2 that 843 US companies took advantage of the act.
Despite HIA’s intent; most repatriated cash was spent on buybacks/dividends
Despite the U.S. Treasury Department’s guidelines that repatriated earnings should be
spent on capital investment, R&D, M&A, and other pro-growth uses such as hiring, this
was not ultimately the result: the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
estimates 3 that $0.92 of every $1.00 brought back was used to return cash to
shareholders ($0.79 for buybacks and $0.15 for dividends) 4 , and that repatriation
ultimately did not lead to a pick-up in capex, employment or R&D. In fact, a 2011 report
by US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations 5 found that the top 15

repatriating companies—which accounted for 52% of the total repatriated amount—
actually reduced their US workforce and decreased their R&D spending following the
repatriation act. The authors of the NBER study point out that cash is fungible, and
firms were able to bypass the guidelines on how repatriated cash should be used.

Our data for the S&P 500 similarly suggests that share repurchases saw the biggest

No alpha from repatriation and multiples actually compressed
Our analysis of the top 15 repatriating companies (from Table 7) suggests that while
these companies initially outperformed both the S&P 500 and equal-weighted S&P 500

Post-repatriation cash use: will this time be different?
Valuations, investor preference, growth & leverage ratios suggest less buybacks
While any potential restrictions on the use of repatriated earnings are still unknown, we
suspect that a pick-up in buybacks is likely, but that a lower proportion will be used for
buybacks today than during the last repatriation holiday. Valuations were generally more
attractive in 2004-2005 on most metrics (Table 9), and we’ve found that buybacks tend
to be more rewarded when stocks are cheap (Chart 8). Additionally, the largest buybacks
have not generated alpha for the last several years, as investors have increasingly
agitated for companies to use their excess cash on pro-growth investments (namely
capex.) According to BofAML’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 60% of investors
want companies to increase capex spending, vs. 17% who want companies to return
cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1). This compares to a majority of investors desiring
companies to return cash to shareholders when the HIA was passed in late 2004.
Companies may also feel less pressure to bolster per share metrics by reducing share
count if top line is recovering and organic growth is finally materializing. And from a
capital structure perspective, if leverage loses its tax benefit, given that leverage ratios
are already high (see below) companies may be less likely to reduce their equity capital
base, as that would marginally increase their weighted average cost of capital.
Special dividends, pay-down of debt may be other likely uses
Companies may also return the cash to shareholders by issuing a one-time special
dividend: income remains in-demand, given that both interest rates and dividend payout
ratios remain historically low. And if a repatriation tax holiday comes within the context
of broader tax reform that includes an end to the deductibility of interest expense,
companies may choose to pay down debt over other uses of cash, in an attempt to skew
their balance sheets less toward debt and more toward equity (see the section on no
Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017 9
interest tax shield later in this report). Deleveraging balance sheets may also be spurred
by a continued environmwnt of rising interest. Leverage for S&P non-Financials has
steadily been ticking up over the last few years, and, if we exclude the cash-rich
Technology sector, leverage is approaching all-time highs (Chart 9).

Potential EPS impacts
$8-9 (6-7%) hit to GAAP EPS from the mandatory tax on accumulated overseas
profit
We estimate that a tax of accumulated overseas profits of $1.2tn would result in a cash
tax impact of $100-120bn (which may be allowed to be paid over 8-10 years), and a
one-time hit to GAAP EPS of $8-9 (a lower $65-80bn, given that a several large
multinationals such as AAPL already provision for US taxes on a portion of their
overseas profit, resulting in effective US tax rates well above the US statutory rate). Our
analysis assumes Trump’s/the Blueprint’s proposed rates of 8.75%/10%, and that all
overseas profits are hit with this one-time tax, as suggested by their plans. See Table
10.
Note that our estimate of ~$1.2tn of cumulative profits overseas is based on estimates
from us, our fundamental analysts, and company filings, where in many cases only
overseas cash but not other indefinitely invested earnings are disclosed/estimated.
Thus, the tax on these earnings could be slightly higher, though the Blueprint would tax
earnings not held in cash at a lower 3.5% rate. (We conservatively assume our estimated
$1.2tn is all cash and use the higher 8.75% rate under the Blueprint and 10% under
Trump’s plan in our below analysis).

We estimate share buybacks add $4 (or as high as $6) to EPS (GAAP & non-GAAP)
If the full $1.2tn that we estimate for overseas cash for the S&P 500 ex. Financials &
Real Estate is brought back (given the tax is mandatory and will be paid either way) and
50% is used on buybacks (~3% of S&P 500 market cap), this could add ~$4 to S&P 500
EPS. And if 80% (~4% of market cap) were used on buybacks, similar to NBER’s
estimate of what occurred following the 2004 tax holiday, this could add $6 to EPS.
(The difference between the Trump and Blueprint tax rates is small, leading to only
cents in index EPS.) If one assumed companies only brought half of their offshore cash
home immediately, even though the full amount was taxed, these benefits would be cut
in half.
Note that buyback programs may span several years, which could spread out some of
the EPS benefit below. But if one assumes a buyback is fully executed in Year 1, this
provides a one-time boost to EPS growth and a recurring benefit to future EPS given a
permanently lower share count.

Cross-asset implications of repatriation
Repatriation should spur USD-buying – up to 40% may be non-USD denominated
While few companies disclose the currency composition of their offshore cash, our FX
team estimates that 60-75% is already in USD while 25-40% is non-dollar-denominated.
(If we extrapolate based on the S&P 500’s geographic revenue exposure, the largest
proportion could be in Europe, followed by emerging Asia.) This may result in upward
pressure on the USD (which they estimate could amount to $250-$400bn if half of all
offshore cash, which they estimate at ~$2tn, was repatriated). Their analysis of the
EUR-USD during the last repatriation holiday suggests an “announcement effect” is
likely, as the dollar strengthened ahead of the bulk of the actual repatriation flows.
Repatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs
Our rates team’s analysis of some of the largest multinationals with offshore cash
suggests ~70% of cash is invested in securities with maturities greater than one year,
with the remaining 30% having shorter maturities. See table below. They believe
repatriation could put upward pressure on bank funding costs as firms reduce their
holdings in these short-term investments. According to Crane Data on offshore money
fund holdings, our rates team cites that $161bn of offshore funds are held in commercial
paper and CDs, of which the majority are from financial institutions with Japan, France and
Canada the largest issuers.

Border adjustment tax analysis
A new tax policy outlined in the Blueprint proposal that has been getting a lot of
attention recently is the border adjustment tax, or the application of border adjustments
to a company’s imports and exports. While Trump has described the proposal as being
“too complicated,” it is a key component of the Blueprint plan and should not be
ignored. Additionally, White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s recent reference to
“…the plan taking shape right now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax
imports from countries…” could be a sign that Trump is not as against the proposal his
other comments would indicate.
12 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017
This policy would effectively result in the tax authorities recognizing all sales that take
place in the US (regardless of where they are produced) and all the domestic costs
incurred to produce goods and services for customers (regardless of where the sale
takes place). As a result, net importers (such as many retailers) would suffer, as they
would have to pay taxes on their domestic sales without being able to deduct a
significant portion of their costs of production. Conversely, net exporters (companies
with much of their production in the US but sales outside of the US) would stand to
benefit from not having to pay taxes on their foreign sales while being able to deduct a
significant proportion of production costs (Exhibit 3). Purely domestic companies would
be unaffected.

Even if border adjustments are enacted, there is significant uncertainty around
implementation details. For this analysis, we focus on the first order impact of border
adjustments, but we recognize there would be significant second order impacts on the
pricing of products, pricing within the supply chain, foreign exchange rates as well as
foreign policy reactions. (We discuss many of these second order impacts later in this
report.) For the current exercise, we also ignored the cost of services as the
implementation of these rules would be more complicated. See the Methodology
section for more details.
We estimate that at a 20% tax rate, border adjustments would detract $5-6 from 2018
EPS, with nearly 80% of the drag coming from the Consumer Discretionary and
Consumer Staples sectors (roughly evenly split). This impact includes a 50% haircut to
account for offsets from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power. On one
hand, we may be drastically underestimating the impact because we have not included
the second order impacts on the supply chain. For example, many retailers source the
bulk of their goods from domestic suppliers, who source their goods from overseas
suppliers. So while the original retailer may not feel the direct tax hit from importing
goods, the supplier that took the tax hit would likely pass along a significant portion of
this via a higher cost. On the other hand, the supplier or the retailer could look for
alternate domestic sources for those products, but it would largely depend on whether
the cost differential of production between the US and overseas exceeded the border
adjustment tax. Some key components in determining the cost differential are the
foreign exchange rates (more on this below) and labor costs. In the end, the net impact
of the border adjustment taxes will be driven by a complex interplay between corporate
tax rates, pricing power, foreign exchange moves, foreign versus domestic availability
and cost differentials.

Offsetting BAT with a little math and some price increases
A company could fully offset the border adjustment tax by raising prices such that the
after-tax increase in sales would exceed the drag from the lost deduction of costs. All
else equal, the break-even price increase would be equivalent to the cost of goods sold
as a % of sales multiplied by net % imported and the tax to after-tax ratio, which at a
20% rate is 0.25 (20%/80%).
As an example, a company with a 25% gross margin that imports 30% of its goods
would need to increase its prices by of 5-6% to offset the border adjustment tax, all
else equal.
Offsetting BAT with FX
Some of the increase in the after-tax cost of imported goods can also be offset by a
strengthening dollar. For example, companies producing goods in Mexico, which stand to
see a 25% increase in the cost of imported goods, should see the cost increase partially
offset by the 13% devaluation of the Mexican Peso against the US dollar since the
election. The net cost increase is a more digestible 9%, especially when you also
consider that the Peso has devalued nearly 30% since its 2013 peak. While it may offer
little consolation to corporates, the US Dollar Index is up over 25% since mid-2014, so
the border adjustment tax would presumably act as a reversal of the lowered cost of
overseas production over that period.
Border adjustment sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates how the change in the tax rate and the application of the
border adjustment tax would impact the domestic earnings of a hypothetical company
with sensitivity to different tax rates and net export assumptions. We assumed the
company has a 40% gross margin, operating expenses are 20% of sales and an initial
tax rate of 35%. As you would expect, the biggest benefit would accrue to companies
with significant net exports at a high domestic tax rate (bigger tax shield) and the most
negative impact to significant net imports at a high domestic tax rate (higher taxes on
higher taxable income).

Closing loopholes
Both Trump and the Blueprint proposal suggest getting rid of special-interest
deductions and credits that distort capital allocation decisions. The table below lists the
25 biggest US corporate tax breaks. The #1 and #3 “tax breaks” are the deferral of
foreign income and certain foreign financial income, but these would become irrelevant
if the US moves to a territorial tax system, as is being proposed by the Blueprint plan.
Exempting corporations from paying US taxes on foreign income would put the US in

line with the rest of the world on this issue. Similarly, the accelerated depreciation of
machinery & equipment would become irrelevant due to the move toward taxation
based on business cash flow and the immediate write-off of capital expenditures. Once
the depreciation from legacy investments has run off, then depreciation should become
irrelevant for tax purposes. We also highlight the deduction for US production activities
(section 199) due to it being specifically highlighted by the Blueprint proposal as no
longer being necessary under the new tax policies. Both the Blueprint and Trump have
noted that they would likely maintain the Research & Development related tax credits.

Immediate capex expensing should provide some initial cash tax benefits
The shift to the immediate expensing of capital expenditures should provide a
significant near-term reduction in cash taxes as companies benefit from the ongoing
reduction of taxable income from the depreciation of legacy assets combined with the
full expensing of new investments. As the depreciation of legacy assets rolls off, the tax
benefit would become more modest. Keep in mind that, for tax reporting, many
companies already take advantage of the accelerated depreciation schedules discussed
above. The ongoing benefit of capex expensing derives from the deferral in the timing
of tax payments.

No interest tax shield
Another key offset to the lower corporate tax rate is the proposed ending of the
deduction of net interest expense. We assume that this rule would apply to new debt
and that existing debt would be grandfathered. This tax shield removal would increase
the cost of debt by an incremental 25% (not to mention the 100bp+ rise in long-term
interest rates seen since the summer of 2016). In the table below, we illustrate the
impact on S&P 500 corporate profits. We estimate that over time, the removal of the
interest rate deduction would detract about 4%, or $4-5 from S&P 500 2018 EPS,
although the initial impact would be less significant given 70-90% of the debt is long
term.

Many investors assume that interest deductions would likely apply only to new debt, and
if this were the case, the drag would be gradual for the overall S&P 500 as debt matures
and is refinanced. Companies have shifted the composition of their debt toward longer
maturities and fixed rates. We estimate an average S&P 500 debt maturity of over eight
years, with just one-third maturing within the next three years. The grandfathering of
existing debt is a reasonable assumption, but not a sure thing, in our view. There is a
possibility that legislators apply it to all debt on the grounds that most companies are
expected to be net beneficiaries of comprehensive tax reform.
There is also a possibility that this policy is phased in over a number of years, with
certain portions of the existing debt losing their interest deductibility over time.

The most negatively impacted companies would clearly be the ones with the most
leverage, in addition to those with depressed earnings (Metals & Mining, Energy, etc.).
While the Utilities sector has a lot of leverage, there would likely be a pass through to
customers in determining their allowed rate increase.

How will levered companies react?
Companies will likely grow comfortable with a smaller amount of debt, retain more
earnings, use less cash for dividends and share buybacks, and potentially draw down
cash if they have it. If a tax holiday is also granted, that might offset the loss of benefit.
Companies that regularly issue long-term debt may choose to reduce that burden to
offset the tax change, and find those funds elsewhere. We find it unlikely that the
change would result in a surge in equity issuance, unless the change applies to existing
debt, which is unlikely in our view. While this change should be taken as a line item in a
wholistic bill, there are victims and beneficiaries here. Corporations that have high
leverage ratios, low retained earnings, high interest expense to earnings ratios, no cash
overseas offset from repatriation, and those that have recurring long-term debt needs
may be most at risk.
Other implications
While some argue that companies will try to raise outsized amounts of investment grade
capital ahead of the deadline to lock in funding with the tax benefit before the loophole
is closed, there is a reasonable chance that a provision is included in the legislation that
would treat such debt as new debt. In our Investment Grade Strategist Hans Mikkelsen’s
view, demand for IG credit could be materially reduced over time. The tax change could
also dampen Leverage Buyout (LBO) activity, according to our High Yield strategist
Michael Contopoulos, where these funds are already struggling to generate high returns
– note that LBO funds are currently sitting on close to $1tn in cash looking for a home,
according to Preqin’s third quarter update.
Who could be hurt: See Table 21 for a screen of stocks with high net interest
expense as a percentage of net income which could potentially be hurt most by an
end to the deductibility of interest expense.

Methodology
Repatriation impact
We estimated cumulative overseas profits for the S&P 500 excluding Financials and
Real Estate via three sources: 1) Bloomberg data on cash held overseas (if
disclosed/available), 2) BofAML analyst estimates on cumulative overseas profits or
cash, and 3) our own estimate if neither (1) or (2) are available, based on (Total cash x
[% of foreign sales +10%]) for companies with at least 5% foreign sales.
We apply the effective tax rates proposed by Trump (10%) and the Blueprint (8.75%) to
our estimated $1.2tn in overseas cash to determine taxes due for the S&P 500 ex.
Financials & Real Estate. We estimate that 100% is brought back given that the tax is
mandatory. To compute the one-time tax impact to GAAP EPS, we divide the cumulative
tax impact by the S&P 500 divisor, after first excluding the impact from several large
multinationals (e.g. AAPL) which already provision a portion of their overseas profits for
US taxes and have effective US tax rates well above 35%.
Note that for companies for which our analysts provided estimates, we asked them to
provide cumulative overseas profits if possible, but in most cases this number reflects
overseas cash. Thus, taxes paid could be slightly higher than we estimate given that
both the Blueprint and Trump’s plans suggest a mandatory tax on all accumulated
overseas profits, some of which may be permanently reinvested; here, the Blueprint
suggests a lower 3.5% tax for retained earnings not held in cash/equivalents, suggesting
that any additional taxes payable that we are not capturing are likely to be small.
To calculate the % EPS impact from buybacks, we subtract the amount of taxes payable
from total cash brought back for the S&P 500 ex. Financials & Real Estate (and for each
sector) and divide this by the market cap for the S&P 500 (and for each sector.) We
multiply this % impact for the overall index by our 2018E EPS of $137 to determine the
potential EPS impact, applying various buyback scenarios (10-100%). We use 50% as a
base case scenario, which is lower than the 80% brought back during the 2004 tax
holiday, to be conservative.
Border adjustments impact on EPS
We estimate the costs of goods imported and exported for each company using the
latest company filings, conversations with analysts, industry research, management
commentary and the Input-Output accounts data published by the U.S. Department of
Commerce. For more information about the Input-Output accounts data, please refer to
the Bureau of Economic Analysis website at http://www.bea.gov/industry/io_annual.htm.
When using the estimates based on Input-Output accounts, we adjust them to account
for the varying foreign exposures of different S&P 500 industries. For companies that
source products through importers (e.g. retailers), we only included the costs of goods
estimated to be directly imported by each company, as taxes pertaining to those
imported goods should be paid by the importers themselves.
We estimate the earnings impact of border adjustments based on the additional taxes
that companies would pay on the costs of imported goods sold in the US (nondeductible)
and any reduction in taxes related to the production costs for exported
goods (deductible). To calculate this, we multiple the net value of imported COGS by the
assumed tax rate. Note that the net impact can be either positive or negative depending
on whether the company is a net importer or exporter. We assume a 50% haircut to the
impact to account for from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power.
Lower corporate tax rate impact on EPS
We estimate the normalized effective domestic tax rate of a company based on
conversations with the analysts or the median 5-year domestic income tax rate. If a
company had a negative tax rate for a particular year, we exclude the tax rate of that
24 Equity Strategy Focus Point | 29 January 2017
year from the median calculation. For companies with normalized tax rates of more than
75%, we assume 35%.
The impact of a lower corporate tax rate on company earnings is directly proportional to
the difference between the current domestic tax rate and the proposed tax rate. The
impact is calculated by taking the difference between the current tax rate and the
proposed tax rate, and dividing it by (1-current tax rate).
To calculate the impact of a lower corporate tax rate on the S&P 500 earnings, we can
divide the change in the effective tax rate by (1 – the current effective tax rate).
Interest deductibility impact
We estimate the cost associated with the removal of the net interest expense deduction
from taxable income by multiplying the net interest expense by the tax rate.
