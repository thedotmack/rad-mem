Foreword and Acknowledgements
The idea of compiling an Oxford companion to the Arab–Israeli conflict was first
presented to me in 2005 by Markus Bouillon, who served for me both in my UN
capacity in Jerusalem and at the International Peace Institute (IPI) in New York. Nur
Laiq laboriously and faithfully collected most of the relevant documents and contributed
to the organization of the book and the drafting of the introduction and comments.
Fabrice Aidan, a French diplomat, who served for ten years as my special
assistant and political adviser in my different United Nations capacities played an
instrumental role for the production of this volume. He made essential substantive
inputs to the organization and compilation of the documents and the composition of
the comments, throughout the book, as well as to the introduction. David Makovsky
and Marwan Muasher deserve thanks for reviewing the book and for providing
insightful comments.
I would like also to thank my staff at the International Peace Institute (IPI), Walter
Kemp and Adam Lupel, for their editing contribution. Miklos Pinther, former chief
UN cartographer, who in 2000 oversaw the delineation of the Blue Line between Israel,
Lebanon and Syria, compiled and produced the maps in this volume. Finally, my
executive assistant, Jilla Moazami, gave invaluable administrative support. Without
these colleagues, the book would have never come to print. I am delighted that the
volume came to its conclusion on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing of
the Oslo Accords of 1993.
I am grateful to the Government of Norway for generous support to the International
Peace Institute’s (IPI) Middle East program over many years.
I dedicate the book to my beloved wife, Ambassador Mona Juul, my companion in
war and peace, without whom I would never have become involved in the imbroglio of
the Middle East.

About the Editors
TERJE RØD-LARSEN
Terje Rød-Larsen became the President of the International Peace Institute (IPI) in
2005. IPI is an independent, international not-for-profit think tank headquartered in
New York, with regional offices in Vienna and Manama. IPI is dedicated to the
prevention and settlement of conflict. The UN Secretary-General is the honorary
chair of the board of the International Peace Institute. Concurrently, Terje Rød-Larsen
is a UN Under-Secretary-General. He serves as a Special Envoy of the Secretary-
General.
Terje Rød-Larsen began his career as an academic, studying history, philosophy,
public administration, and sociology. He taught Sociology, Political Science, and
Philosophy at the Universities of Bergen and Oslo, before establishing the Fafo Institute
for Applied Sciences in Oslo in 1981.
As Director of Fafo, he initiated a research project into the living conditions of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The relationships with both Palestinians
and Israelis that he established during the period of preparing and implementing this
project led to a request by the PLO in 1992 that he help establish a secret channel for
negotiations between the PLO and the Government of Israel. Those negotiations
concluded with the Oslo Accords and the signing of the Declaration of Principles at
the White House on 13 September 1993.
In 1993, Mr Rød-Larsen was appointed Ambassador and Special Adviser for the
Middle East Peace process to the Norwegian Foreign Minister. In mid-1994, he was
appointed United Nations Under-Secretary-General, Special Coordinator for Gaza and
the West Bank. In 1996, he was appointed Norwegian Cabinet Minister for Planning
and Cooperation.
In 1999, he moved back to the UN as Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace
Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the Palestinian Authority at the level of Under-Secretary-
General, a post he held until December 2004. In this capacity he negotiated the Israeli
withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in 2000 and established the UN line of withdrawal,
the ‘Blue Line’.
On 14 December 2004, he was appointed by the Secretary-General as his Special
Envoy for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1559, on Lebanon and
Syria. In this capacity he negotiated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon in
2005. He also represented the UN Secretary-General in the cease-fire negotiations
during the 2006 war in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel.

The Crooked Course:
Step by Step on the Path to Peace
INTRODUCTION
As Immanuel Kant observed, “out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing
was ever made.” And the Middle East peace process is no exception. It runs a crooked
course. This work provides a paper trail of the meandering and rocky path of the peace
process. Relevant documents related to the Arab–Israeli conflict over the past century
(since the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916) are compiled in this book. It provides an
annotated and chronological overview of attempts to make peace in one of the most
difficult and protracted conflicts in the world, and it includes a full set of accompanying
maps specially made for this edition.
The sheer volume of such a work raises the critical problem of how to present the
documents in a way that facilitates their accessibility and understanding. A simple
chronological ordering would miss important connections between the documents,
which are thus better grouped by common theme. To this end, we have divided the
volume into five thematic Parts. Part I compiles documents related to the formal peace
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as those related to Israel’s
unilateral disengagement from Gaza. The documents in Part II relate to the many
informal peace proposals and ideas offered over the years that have served to contribute

ON PART I: PEACE AGREEMENTS AND THE
DISENGAGEMENT FROM GAZA
Nothing about the quest for peace in the Middle East has been simple or easily attained.
Merely bringing Palestinians and Israelis together was a feat that took decades to
achieve. Despite all the efforts exerted by not only the principal parties, but also local
actors, regional neighbors, and international players, agreements between the two sides

have been scarce. This Part chronicles the rare moments when both Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators put pen to paper in an effort to resolve a conflict that has
seemed intractable.
Part I begins with the Oslo peace talks, which in 1993 produced the Declaration of
Principles (DoP) and the mutual recognition of the State of Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people. These two agreements formed the basis for all subsequent talks between the
parties.
In 1992, as the director of the Norwegian research institute Fafo, I initiated, together
with then member of Knesset Yossi Beilin, secret talks between him and local Palestinian
leader Faisal Husseini, at the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem. These talks, which
were facilitated by Fafo and the Foreign Ministry of Norway, reached a dead end later that
year. The Norwegians realized that without involving the exiled and outlawed Palestinian
leadership in Tunis, nothing could be accomplished. At the time, both Israeli and
American citizens were forbidden to engage with any member of the PLO. In December
1992, I flew to Tunis to meet for the first time with PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat. In that
meeting in his villa, in the darkness of the early morning hours, he authorized the head of
Fatah’s financial wing, Ahmed Qorei (alias Abu Ala), to travel to Oslo for secret talks
facilitated by Fafo in cooperation with the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. The first meeting
took place at Borregaard Manor outside Oslo, in January 1993.
From January to May 1993, secret talks were conducted as a pre-negotiation phase,
in parallel to the Madrid process taking place in Washington. The goals of prenegotiations
in Oslo were twofold: to build trust between the Palestinian and Israeli
representatives; and to explore possible parameters of an agreement. In order to reach
the first goal, the exercise was restricted to a small group, willing to engage in secret
intense interaction over a lengthy period. Unlike the massive delegations in Washington,
the delegations in Oslo were never larger than three to five people on each side,
with continued interaction often from dawn to dusk.
In Oslo, the Palestinians were represented from day one by a delegation of the PLO,
handpicked by its chairman, Yasir Arafat. The rationale behind this unprecedented
step was that the Norwegians had discovered that the PLO was already controlling
every detail, albeit invisibly, of the bilateral and multilateral talks in Washington.
Furthermore we believed that if the PLO and Yasir Arafat were not directly involved
in the talks, they still had the ability and the will to block any agreement. Allowing
others to reach an agreement would be tantamount to political suicide by the PLO.
Therefore, it was necessary to have them at the table. Without them, no agreement
could be reached.
The pre-negotiation phase ended on 1 May 1993. The talks had reached a point
where both parties believed that the other was negotiating in good faith and that an
agreement had to take the shape of a declaration of principles. On that date, the head of
the Palestinian negotiation team, Ahmed Qorei, invited me for a walk in the hills above
Oslo. He made it clear—in the most explicit of words—that the PLO would not
continue into a final round of talks unless the Israelis “upgraded” their delegation to
high-level officials. Up to this point, the Israelis were represented by two academics
(Ron Pundak and Yair Hirschfeld) who did not hold any formal position in the

government. In the following days, I flew to Israel to convey the request to Yossi Beilin,
then Deputy Foreign Minister. Shortly afterwards, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
dispatched the Director General of the ministry, Uri Savir, and the head of the
ministry’s legal department, Joel Singer, to Oslo. The Norwegians had, until then,
seen the secret talks in Oslo and their potential outcome only as possible inputs to the
negotiations in Washington. We were puzzled—and pleasantly surprised—to realize
that the parties now wanted to negotiate the full deal under the Oslo framework.
Indeed, in the spring of 1993 the parties started to conduct proper negotiations in
Oslo—out of the public eye—rather than through the formal process in Washington.
Within four months, the Declaration of Principles was initialed in a secret ceremony in
the Government Guest House in Oslo. This was followed by a new set of secret
negotiations in Paris, facilitated by the Norwegian team (Johan Jorgen Holst, Jan
Egeland, Mona Juul, and myself). The outcome was the mutual recognition of the
State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which paved the way for the
formal signing of the Oslo Accords on the White House lawn on 13 September 1993.
The Declaration of Principles was based on the approach that the easiest issues
should be resolved first, with remaining issues to be addressed later, step-by-step. A
Palestinian Authority for self-rule would be established, first gaining control over Gaza
and Jericho, and then gradually expanding into the West Bank. The details of the
expansion were to be hammered out in the so-called Oslo II Agreement, signed in
Cairo on 28 September 1995.
As unique and effective as this approach proved to be, the Oslo Accords would not
have been possible without the dramatic changes taking place within the international
system at the time. The PLO had been financially dependent on the states of the Arab
Gulf and the Communist bloc. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Arafat’s support of
Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War of 1991 resulted in the collapse of funding for the
PLO and an end to remittances to Palestinian families in Gaza and the West Bank.
Simultaneously, the first Intifada between 1987 and 1993 and the emergence of a new
local leadership in Gaza and the West Bank created a threat to the leadership of the
PLO in exile in Tunis. The organization needed desperately to regain its financial
footing, as well as its political stature. These were major incentives to move the
Organization into what was to become the Oslo process.
The Israeli leadership also had its reasons to come to the negotiating table. The rise
of satellite television channels, such as CNN, beamed live images around the world of
Israeli soldiers armed to the teeth combating stone-throwing kids in Gaza and the West
Bank. Support for the government of Israel dropped dramatically in Europe and at
home. Israelis began to feel that they were losing the moral high ground. Israeli leaders
saw that using traditional military means to combat the Intifada came at a high political
and moral cost. They too were in search of a political way out. In short, the Oslo
channel came precisely at the right time, providing a lifeline for both the Israeli and
Palestinian leaderships.
The implementation of the Declaration of Principles started in earnest in 1994, with
Yasir Arafat’s spectacular arrival in Gaza and the rapid establishment of the Palestinian
Authority. I had the pleasure of welcoming him on behalf of UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as his newly appointed Special Coordinator for the Occupied

Territories and Personal Representative to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority at
our new headquarters in Gaza city. The PLO had regained its uncontested leadership,
and the Palestinian Authority received a massive financial boost with the influx of
donor money from across the world. Israel received a moral boost as a large number of
countries formally recognized its existence and established diplomatic relations.
A hallmark of the Declaration of Principles was the establishment of a gradual
approach to resolving the conflict. Gradualism now became the keyword for describing
the peace process. By breaking the overall goal of peace into manageable sections that
could be addressed in sequence, the Oslo process allowed for progress to be made and
trust to develop on less contentious issues before tackling more controversial topics like
Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, and refugees, which could threaten to derail
any talks.
One of the principal advantages of the step-by-step or gradualist approach was that
it enabled the parties to reach compromises through ongoing dialogue and interaction
with each other by starting with the easiest issues and leaving the hardest for last. It
allowed for an incremental change in perceptions and political positions. Although
gradualism allowed success to be achieved in a variety of areas, moving the process
forward, at each stage, depended on the parties taking the bold steps necessary to fulfill
their respective commitments. The main weakness was slow movement in implementation,
with progress falling behind agreed upon timelines. This led to periodic
disillusionment and back-sliding.
A recurrent problem was that the parties had failed to agree on a mechanism to
penalize non-compliance. This critical deficiency undermined progress. As leaders and
the political climate changed, so too did the resolve to implement.
Successful gradualism required the use of ambiguous language on the most contentious
issues: Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees. The successive Israeli governments
and the Palestinian leadership had substantially different views on the final
status of all four of these issues. The language contained within the Oslo documents, as
well as subsequent agreements, provides room for interpretation. Either side could
claim that the text represents their interests. This allowed leaders to go home to their
respective constituents and retain popular support.
Another practice that proved effective was the use of the annexes attached to agreements
to flesh out disruptive details, or to substantially water down the impact of
certain commitments made within the body of the text. In many cases the annexes are
exhaustively long and detailed but are rarely read by the public, affording the leaders
political space to make agreements that might otherwise face public criticism.
The three Israeli Prime Ministers who were in office from 1993 to 1999—Rabin,
Peres, and Netanyahu—approached the challenges of peace through a concept of
gradualism, postponing the tricky final status issues. Barak, who took office in 1999,
was the first Israeli Prime Minister to address the final status head-on with a “totalist”
approach (read below).
While the Oslo process was based on the concept of gradualism, characterized by
bilateral negotiations—facilitated by a third party—and cumulative small steps demonstrating
good faith, Ariel Sharon eventually took a contrary approach through
“uncompromising unilateralism”. The day after he won the election in February 2001,

he invited me to meet him at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. During the course of
the conversation, he surprisingly asked what I would do with the peace process if I were
him. I had just re-read his autobiography, Warrior, and answered: “Both as a soldier
and as a politician, you have a history of being bold, daunting, daring and making
surprise moves. In that spirit, I would suggest that you dismantle the settlements and
pull your troops completely out of Gaza.” For a minute I worried that this would anger
him, but he answered very calmly. “I cannot do it.” I asked why. He said: “Because of
the harbor.” I replied, rather perplexed: “But there is no harbor in Gaza.” He said:
“That’s not the point. They could build one if we left Gaza.” Then I realized that,
contrary to common opinion, Sharon had no ideological inhibitions about leaving
Gaza. His concerns were only about security. This gave me high hopes that he would
eventually do it. Three years of stalemate were to follow. And then in December 2003,
out of the blue, Sharon made the sweeping and stunning pronouncement that Israel
would leave Gaza and end its occupation of the Strip.
Ariel Sharon deserves praise for withdrawing from Gaza. But his unilateral move
undermined the possibility of peaceful relations between the inhabitants of the Gaza
Strip and Israel. The PLO and the Palestinian Authority were sidelined. They could not
claim credit for the move, and thus had scant motivation for supporting it. Instead,
militants in Gaza and the West Bank harvested all the benefits. The Disengagement
plan undermined those on the Palestinian side who claimed that the negotiating table
was a more efficient tool than the barrel of a gun in order to resolve the conflict.
ON PART II: PEACE PROPOSALS AND IDEAS
The formal agreements covered in Part I represent the conclusions of long and complex
diplomatic processes. Part II encompasses proposals and ideas that contributed to
breaking taboos and changing opinions that paved the way for precedent-setting
agreements.
In the late 1970s and 1980s several plans and initiatives were put forward which
maintain relevance for the future of the peace process. One idea was a comprehensive
and unified Arab approach which was first proposed in the Fahd Plan (1981), and later
refined in the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The latter peace proposal promoted by
then Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah al-Saud represented a unified shift in the Arab
States’ approach to Israel. Where there was once rejection, the Arab peace initiative
created the possibility of universal recognition of the State of Israel. All 57 countries of
the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) endorsed the initiative.
The aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 opened new opportunities to address the
complex issue of peace in the Middle East. This was the backdrop for the groundbreaking
Madrid Peace Conference, convened by the United States and the Soviet Union. It
raised new hopes for peaceful resolution to the enduring conflicts of the region. The
conference created an unprecedented platform for peace talks, based on the principle of
“land for peace”. The Israelis would have to cede land to their Arab adversaries in
return for peace and security. The Madrid formula for organizing such talks followed a

xxxiv
The Crooked Course
two-track approach: bilateral negotiations in Washington; and the formation of several
multilateral working groups to address specific issues such as water, refugees, the
economy, etc. It is worth noting that the PLO was not accepted at the negotiating
table. Instead the Palestinians were represented by a joint delegation of Jordanian
officials and prominent Palestinians, who allegedly were not associated with the PLO.
In stark contrast to the Oslo process, the Washington talks under the Madrid formula
were public and in the constant glare of the media. This resulted in the parties
continuously posturing to win the favor of the complex power structures that they
reported to, as well as of domestic public constituencies. However, Madrid broke the
taboo of direct bilateral talks between Arabs and Israelis. Madrid failed as a process, but
succeeded as a spectacular event for creating hope, and formed a springboard for the
subsequent secret Oslo talks.
As noted in the comments on Part I, Oslo and all subsequent agreements were
embraced by the three Israeli Prime Ministers before Ehud Barak took office in 1999.
As opposed to the gradualist approach of his predecessors, Barak took the path of
totalism, i.e. aiming at solving all remaining issues in one go. Pursuant to this approach,
as he put it: “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”. Heroically, he wanted to
resolve simultaneously all matters with Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinians, and put a
final end to all conflicts.
Shortly after his election, I was invited to meet him at his home in the outskirts of Tel
Aviv. He described his new approach metaphorically: “In order to resolve a problem,
you need to analyze what the problem is, and define your objective. The problem at
hand is that we have an ugly dog in front of us. The objective is to beautify the dog. In
order to do so, you need to analyze why it is ugly. And then you see that it is the tail that
makes the dog ugly. Through this analysis, our task becomes easy: by chopping off the
tail we will have a beautiful dog.” And then he added sarcastically: “But I will not chop
off the tail of the dog the way you Oslo people have been doing it, painfully slice by slice
like a salami. We need to chop it off all in one go.”
In this spirit, in the summer of 2000 President Clinton brought the parties to the
presidential estate at Camp David for marathon talks behind closed doors. The attempt
failed for many reasons. First of all, a few weeks of talks did not provide ample time to
address the thorniest issues (Oslo took six months of negotiation to address the least
difficult issues). Other reasons were internal Palestinian disagreements and difficult
interpersonal relations, in addition to a “take-it-or-leave it” approach by Israel.
Although the leaders left Camp David without diplomatic feathers in their cap,
President Clinton and his team now had a clear sense of what was needed to bridge
the gap between the two parties. In late December 2000, he presented what became
known as the Clinton Parameters. They were a comprehensive set of American ideas
on how to end the conflict. However, time was not on the side of peace. With his second
term coming to an end, Clinton was unable to persuade the parties to conclude an
agreement. In addition, Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount /
Haram al-Sharif in September 2000 signaled the second Palestinian uprising. This
reduced the room for maneuver for the Palestinian negotiators.
Following the election of George W. Bush as President of the United States, and
against the backdrop of the new Intifada, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators gathered in

xxxv
early 2001 in the small Egyptian seaside town of Taba. They attempted, through
bilateral talks, to capitalize on the basic ideas put forward by President Clinton. In
spite of high hopes inspired by the Taba talks, hope was dashed by Israeli intransigence,
reinforced by the violent uprising across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as internal
tensions within the Palestinian leadership.
In an attempt to revive the peace process, President George W. Bush, in a speech in
the Rose Garden in June 2002, took the bold step of publicly declaring support for an
independent Palestinian state. However, he was convinced that Chairman Arafat was
an impediment to peace, due to the continuing violence against Israelis emanating
from Gaza and the West Bank. The President made further US involvement in peace
negotiations contingent upon Arafat’s removal from power, and the implementation of
democratic reforms in the Palestinian Authority’s political structure. This was consistent
with Prime Minister Sharon’s policies. At this time, parts of the Palestinian
leadership either passively turned a blind eye to the rise of bombings in Israel, or
discreetly encouraged it. Arafat became a pariah for several essential players and was
isolated in his Muqata headquarters in Ramallah.
Under these dire circumstances, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a
meeting in the conference room of his executive office at United Nations’ Headquarters
in New York with the US, Russia, and the European Union. The frustration was deep
amongst all parties. Bilateral talks did not happen. Trilateral talks did not work. In
response to the breakdown of the peace process, he suggested that the four actors
coordinate a position to restart the process. The idea was to combine the political
power of the US, Russia’s credibility amongst key Arab states, the European Union’s
financial muscle, and the UN’s legitimacy in a potent new international coalition. The
UN Secretary-General coined the phrase the “Middle East Quartet” for this informal
group. The Quartet met both at principals level and at the level of special envoys.
A novel approach to the imbroglio of Middle East peacemaking was launched:
multilateral unilateralism. The concept was launched at a Quartet Envoys’ working
dinner at the Norwegian Ambassador’s residence in Herzliya (a suburb of Tel Aviv) by
US officials William Burns and David Satterfield. The idea was for the Quartet
members to collectively produce an operational peace plan to be presented to the
parties for implementation, without prior consultation. This resulted in the Quartet
peace plan, referred to as the Road Map, which was eventually presented to the parties
as an ultimatum in 2003. In other words, a unified position was imposed by a group of
third parties upon the disputants—thus, multilateral unilateralism.
The Quartet collectively submitted the text to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Abbas. The US ambassador to Israel presented it to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
who refused to meet with the Quartet as a whole. The Palestinian side accepted the
proposals in total while the Israeli side came up with fourteen reservations.
The Oslo Accords mapped a path towards a possible peace agreement, setting up
milestones to be passed along the way, and stipulating that the ride on this bumpy road
would take five years. It did not define the end point of the journey, because the parties
were not capable of closing the gaps between their positions at the time. The 2003
Performance-Based Road Map of the Quartet was, in many ways, the paper that
concluded the Declaration of Principles of 1993, by designating the last milestone,
the establishment of a Palestinian state.
OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi

The Crooked Course
However, compromises among the Quartet members led to ambiguities which gave
the parties the opportunity to make radically different interpretations of their obligations
under the plan. The Israeli side claimed that the Road Map called for security first—a
complete end of Palestinian violence—before any negotiations could start. This strategy
was called sequentialism. The Palestinian side, and the international community at large,
supported a strategy of parallelism that called for progress on both security and political
issues to happen in lock-step. The collision of the concepts of parallelism and sequentialism
made it impossible to reach the final destination envisioned in the Road Map.
With gridlock in the formal negotiating process, civil society groups tried to take the
initiative. One example of several is the Geneva Accords of December 2003 led by PLO
official Yasser Abed Rabbo and former Israeli Minister Yossi Beilin.
The stalemate in the process continued until Ehud Olmert’s election as Prime
Minister in 2006. Through intense negotiations facilitated by US Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and her team, the parties came close to striking a deal which would
have pushed the peace process forward. However, as the end game of this phase of the
negotiations, also known as the Annapolis process, unfolded, Prime Minister Olmert
had to step down because of an indictment for alleged financial misconduct. At the
same time also, a new wave of rockets emanating from Gaza, lead to a military
operation in the Strip (Operation ‘Cast Lead’).
The scene and characters changed in early 2009 with the election of Barack Obama
as President of the United States, and Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel
for a second time. Shortly after his inauguration, President Obama attempted to
resuscitate the peace process with the appointment of a new high-level special envoy,
Senator George Mitchell. An absolute freeze on settlements, including in Jerusalem,
was made a precondition for bringing the parties to the table. This turned out to be a
self-defeating proposal. For any Israeli Prime Minister, such a major move could only
be the result of, and not the pre-condition for, negotiations.
During this paralysis, the Palestinian leadership looked for alternative ways of
moving forward, and shifted their strategy from bilateralism to unilateralism through
a bid to upgrade the Palestinian status to be on a par with the Vatican at the United
Nations: that of an observer Member State in the General Assembly. This quest reached
its climax during the UN General Assembly sessions of 2011 and 2012. In a speech to
the General Assembly in September 2011, President Abbas called for admission of
Palestine as a Member State of the United Nations. It reflected the growing frustration
among the Palestinian community with the lack of progress since the end of the
Annapolis process in 2008. In December 2012, the Palestinians were granted, with a
large majority, state observer status at the UN.
ON PART III: UNITED NATIONS DOCUMENTS
ON THE QUESTION OF PALESTINE
An accurate picture of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict must include an understanding
of the role of the United Nations. Part III provides a comprehensive collection of
Resolutions and documents which have significantly shaped the context of this seemingly
intractable issue.
OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 10/9/2014, SPi
The Crooked Course
xxxvii
Many of the political battles related to the Arab–Israeli conflict have been fought in
the halls of the United Nations. On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly
voted Resolution 181, also known as the Partition Plan. It called for the creation of two
states—one Palestinian and one Jewish.
Other key UN Resolutions include General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which
calls for the return of Palestinian refugees; General Assembly Resolution 303 (1949),
which designates Jerusalem to be placed under UN jurisdiction; and, most famously,
Security Council Resolution 242 (1967), which calls on Israel to withdraw from all
territory seized during the Six Day War of 1967.
Paradoxically, some of the Resolutions are seen by both parties as supporting their
side of the argument. For example, in Resolution 242 the interpretation of the clause
calling for “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent
conflict” has been controversially ambiguous, and the object of widely different interpretations.
The key argument relates to whether the clause requires Israel to withdraw
from all territory occupied in the 1967 war, or only from some parts of the territory
captured. While many Resolutions have had hardly any effect, they nevertheless
continue to be used as points of reference in the different attempts to resolve the
conflict.
ON PART IV: REGIONAL DOCUMENTS
The Israeli–Palestinian issue cannot be seen in isolation: it affects and has been affected
by broader regional dynamics and conflicts for a century. After years of colonial
competition, France and the United Kingdom drew lines in the sand through the
Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916. This agreement divided the region into spheres of
influence, and eventually led to the creation of new countries. In the subsequent thirty
years, several programmatic initiatives were taken in the context of multiple anticolonial
campaigns for national self-determination and political sovereignty, including
the quest of the Jewish people for a national homeland.
The 1948 war between Arab countries and the newly founded State of Israel resulted
in the latter significantly expanding its territory beyond that allotted to it by the UN
Partition Plan. This marked the beginning of more than half a century of Israeli–Arab
tensions and conflicts. Gradually the focus moved from the legitimacy of the state of
Israel to the country’s territorial boundaries. This coincided with broadening support,
not only internationally but also in Israel, for the establishment of a Palestinian state
living peacefully, side by side, with the state of Israel, within mutually secured borders.
Obtaining the regional buy-in to peace with Israel began with the different armistice
agreements signed in the wake of the 1948 war. While these agreements ended the war,
the fighting continued to flare up as the armistice lines established were not internationally
recognized borders.
The Arab–Israeli conflict came to a new head with the Six Day War in June 1967,
when Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West
Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. In the
aftermath, Arab nations unified their position against Israel with the Arab League

Resolution at the Khartoum Summit, which is referred to as the “Three Noes Document”
due to its clause that states: “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no
negotiations with it”. On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt launched a war against Israel
that ended in a political stand-off between Israel and its Arab adversaries.
In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat broke Arab unity when he—
in a move which stunned the world—flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset in a bid
for a peaceful resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Subsequently, in 1978, he signed
the Camp David Accords that established a separate bilateral peace agreement with
Israel.
Camp David highlighted the importance of a third-party broker. When President
Sadat and his counterpart, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, reached a
stalemate, US President Jimmy Carter invited the parties to his presidential estate for
trilateral discussions on 5 September 1978. Three scheduled days of negotiations
turned into thirteen days of frustrating and intense talks. Since these tripartite discussions
were unable to break the impasse, President Carter decided to work separately
with both sides. The result was an American proposal which incorporated the requirements
of both parties into a single text. After lengthy negotiations on this document,
President Carter’s shuttle diplomacy resulted in the Camp David Accords of 17
September 1978.
In 1993, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat followed the precedent of President Sadat and
broke ranks with fellow Arab leaders by secretly and bilaterally recognizing the State of
Israel and signing the Oslo Accords. The year after, building on the agreements
between Israel and the PLO, King Hussein of Jordan followed suit by negotiating a
bilateral peace treaty with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. This culminated in a
spectacular signing ceremony at the desert border crossing of Wadi Araba in August
1994. In the agreement, Israel acknowledged Jordan’s historical role over Muslim holy
sites in Jerusalem and agreed to recognize this role in future permanent status
negotiations with the Palestinians. The two leaders also agreed on steps such as the
opening of border crossings and economic cooperation.
In 1999, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak defeated incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. As has been described above, the new Prime Minister broke radically
with the concept of gradualism that had been the hallmark of negotiations between
Yasir Arafat and three Israeli Prime Ministers, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and
Benjamin Netanyahu, favoring a more comprehensive approach to the peace process.
For the first half of 2000, Arafat and the Palestinians were left to wait for a Syrian peace
deal that was not to come. Despite Barak offering Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 99
per cent of the Golan Heights, it still fell short of Assad’s demand for a return to the 4
June 1967 lines, and the Syria track subsequently crumbled. This put Arafat on the
spot: how could he now, in front of the Arab world, accept less for the Palestinians than
Assad had demanded for the Syrians?
The Lebanon track fared better. It began in late 1999 with a dialogue between Prime
Minister Barak and me, as the newly appointed UN Special Coordinator for the Middle
East peace process. The Prime Minister confided to me that, as a part of his comprehensive
quest for resolving all the conflicts that Israel had with its neighbors, he wanted
to end Israel’s occupation of Southern Lebanon that had started in 1978. Eventually, he

conceded that only the United Nations, and not Israel alone, could delineate on a map
and demarcate on the ground the line of withdrawal. Such a line had to be, to the best of
the United Nations’ knowledge, in conformity with Lebanon’s international boundaries.
On this basis, and with the consent of the parties, the UN Secretary-General could
then report to the Security Council and eventually recommend that it should confirm
that Israel had ended its occupation. This understanding led to an agreement for the
United Nations to negotiate with the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
Through intense, difficult, and stormy tripartite negotiations over five months, the
UN Secretary-General was in May 2000 able to report to the Security Council that the
UN had reached an agreement with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon on a line of withdrawal
(the so-called Blue Line). On this basis, it was determined that Israeli troops had left all
Lebanese territory. Further, he reported that, consistent with UN requirements, Israel’s
Lebanese proxy, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), had been disarmed and disbanded.
Subsequently, the UN Security Council confirmed the end of Israel’s occupation of
Southern Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.
In September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1559. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan appointed me as his special envoy for its implementation. In a
nutshell the resolution called for respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and political independence; the disbanding and disarming of all Lebanese and non-
Lebanese militias; and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. After Israel’s full withdrawal
from Lebanon in 2000, the only remaining foreign troops were Syrian. Immediately
after the resolution was adopted, I engaged in intense negotiations with President
Assad, who until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on 14
February 2005, was consistently resistant to move on the issue. On 12 March 2005, I
was airborne with a small UN team, among them Fabrice Aidan, on my way to
Damascus for a new round of talks with the President. Midway, the captain informed
me that he was requested to change course and land in Aleppo. Afterwards I was told
that the reason was to avoid the media who were waiting for the arrival of the UN team
in Damascus. I was picked up at Aleppo airport by Walid Muallem, who was then
Deputy Foreign Minister. He brought me to Assad’s villa, where a few hours of
negotiations resulted in the Aleppo understanding, which outlined Syria’s military
withdrawal from Lebanon with specific timelines. Assad honored his word, and
ended twenty-nine years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon consistent with
Resolution 1559.
What is often forgotten in the recurrent doom and gloom in the Middle East, is that
the step-by-step approach, which started with the Camp David Accords of 1978, has
for more than thirty years led to conflict resolution: peace between Israel and Egypt; the
Oslo Accords; the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO; the establishment of the
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, which still functions with its
presidency, cabinet, and ministries; peace between Israel and Jordan in 1994, with
the recognition of borders and a long-lasting security cooperation; Israel’s withdrawal
from Southern Lebanon in 2000; and the subsequent Syrian military withdrawal five
years later; as well as Israel’s pull out from the Gaza Strip. All these steps would have
been difficult, if not impossible, without the previous ones.
In 2000 the attempts to put a final end to the Syrian–Israeli and the Palestinian–
Israeli conflicts both failed. This exposes the risks of a totalist approach to solving such

The Crooked Course
conflicts. These heroic attempts, facilitated by President Bill Clinton and his team,
created a crisis of expectations, leading to the second Intifada and violent confrontation
between Israelis and Palestinians, with tragic loss of life on both sides. This illustrates a
fundamental dilemma in the choice between a gradualist and a totalist approach.
Totalism’s “all or nothing” approach is inherently risky. When it backfires, it easily
leads to a relapse into violence. Gradualism is less spectacular and appealing, with its
incremental and long-term approach. However, it is precisely these characteristics
which make it less risky, and more successful under some circumstances.
While totalism failed in 2000, with tragic consequences, it nevertheless broke down a
number of taboos, such as addressing explicitly the partition of Jerusalem and the issue
of Palestinian refugees.
ON PART V: ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN
DOMESTIC DOCUMENTS
Part V seeks to provide a fuller context to the quest for peace in the Middle East. All
politics are local, and the Arab–Israeli conflict typifies this axiom. The ability of
negotiators to come to conclusions is only half the story. Documents such as the
original Palestinian National Charter or Israel’s Declaration of Independence shaped
attitudes, policies, and action on both sides.
Furthermore, the Part includes important policy statements that signal revisions of
previous policies such as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s vision
for a new Palestinian state. In August 2009, Fayyad introduced the “Program of the
Thirteenth Government” (the Fayyad Plan), which established a path to develop a
functional Palestinian state within a two-year time frame. The blueprint sought to
establish and improve governing institutions, end Palestinian economic dependence on
Israel, and enhance overall infrastructure. It was a move to create a de facto Palestinian
state within the existing Palestinian territory, regardless of any formal recognition of
such an entity. Fayyad sought proactive steps to “end the occupation, despite the
occupation”. He stressed it was not meant as a unilateral declaration of statehood.
Indeed, substantial developments did take place during Prime Minister Fayyad’s
tenure. In 2011, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund made
statements that the Palestinian Authority was capable of running the economy of an
independent state, and that it was on track to developing the necessary functions of a
state.
The Middle East peace process continues to run its crooked course. There is no quick
fix. Yet, as this volume demonstrates, many brave attempts have been made to bring
peace to this troubled region.
By compiling annotated documents related to the quest for peace in the Middle East,
a useful record and reference tool are created. Our hope is also that this volume will
inspire future students, analysts, policy makers, and negotiators to learn from, and
draw on, the experiences of the past.

As we continue to move on the crooked path, no doubt, this compendium will have
to be updated in the future. Hopefully, one of those additions will be a peace agreement
that will eventually allow us all to close the book on the protracted conflicts in the
Middle East.
