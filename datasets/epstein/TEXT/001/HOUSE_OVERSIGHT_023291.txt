Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wrote : 
With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong

involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023292 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying " but Leon 
said " or" its on Leon's desk etc" , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

okay, its time for you to decide how you would like to move forward. ( fyi get your money from the 
1031 . the screw up is only one of many,) If you decide to move foward on decanting. phaidon, note basis 
estate update , each requires many carefully orchestrated detailed steps. and precision. there are hundreds of 
millions in saving if done correctly and a huge mess if not. If you want me and my colleagues to do it, 
oversee it paper it and guide it, you should tell me. It is a big undertaking. If not, ok .. Brad and your crew 
can do it. I will have no real further involvement apart from confirming the outcome of my proposed 
structure, I will not risk the admonition of- they thought you said, they thought you meant, they understood it 
to be. but they said you said, ( i e ,I asked at our meeting that accounting be done properly for bens house, 
what came back was ada thought that I meant that we needed to go back to the 97 trust and give him a full third 
party accounting of where his money had gone??!! I kid you not). I dont think brad should talk to jane heller

Jeffrey-given the high daily interest cost (50k+/-) on $$ borrowed which you pointed out yesterday, here's what 
I'm thinking, but I want to be 100% on the same page as you: 
1. Close next monday on the credit line, but don't borrow any $$. (We can, of course push closing back but my 
preference wld be to close.) 
2. Right now, at barry's request, Irene Steiner, on behalf of the trustees is reviewing apol and apo-ol. While 
probably not impt on a "substantive" basis it was (a) impt to barry and (b) is likely good for leon. 
3. We are hoping to have signature pages to the trustees (and returned to us) by early to mid next week. (Ada 
will oversee.) 
4. We will then get the new trust to bofa who, moving quickly (according to them), will have an acct open the 
following week, 12/7-9. 
5. We need to manage execution of paperwork associated with decanting which I assume occurs once apo-ol 
and bank acct are operative. (Ada I'm sure you'll be on top of this). 
6. I assume we will move $$ to pay down loan the day or day after (?) apo-01 bank acct open. As you know we 
cld do this as early as next monday/tuesday but then cash will be sitting in apo-1 while we're waiting for apo-01 
bank acct. 
7. If there are sales of assets (or 'lc's) from leon to apol or apo-01 that needs to be buttoned down and 
organized asap. 
8. Same if you want another NEW trust in the mix as that will involve paperwork and opening an acct with 
bank. 
Let's discuss to make sure we're on the same page on process. B

contemporaneously his hand in the crafting, in fact brad said it was an idea. that HE brad, HAD HAD, from

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i 
have been saying to you for quite a while now. Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he 
prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten 
along quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023296 
after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy 
office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not 
done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said 
three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing 
about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) 
. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When 
we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . 
the savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no 
reason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you 
through the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. 
Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. 
You wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not 
how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but 
at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this 
year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give 
you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work 
that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house 
when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office , somenoe 
like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two bookeepers and two office 
admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will be incolved in art partnership. if 
you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to add in that regard ,except to be able to 
account for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin in any deal. 
Alternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done. and 
you and I can kibbitz about it all. structures outcomes risk, museums. charity, ( joslins answer by the way 
was I had asked how much charity was leon planining to give this year , ( the 2 m ) he didnt include your 
foundation or the payment to me, or from debra and you??!!

As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that 
I have already done ( both known and some things that willneed to remain unknown.) Our arrangement was 
for me to architect sophisticated structures that would be beneficial to you. that is what I have done and will 
continue do in order to fulfill my obligations under our agreement. The discovered fact that you in reality 
need an entire family office built from scratch has been trying I have aleady agreed de- facto to try 
to help. I would suggest that Phaidons payroll and attention pales in importance to your personal 
structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of my suggestions regarding the Eysium office are as 
follows you will need a budget of 3- 5 million per year. CEO 1 million, new tax person to work with rich, 
250. new bookkeeper ,200 new paralegal to work with ADA ALan etc , coordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul 
weiss , new acct openings, sec filings , sales tax review, etc. $150 . art point person. loan, inventory,

agreement ended months ago . seperate from the art partnership (which i was told yesterday to my 
amazement is still not funded) . i am obligated to complete ? the time i have dedicated since oct/ dec has 
been spent mainly as your friend. tom, brad though i am fully cognizant of my responsiblities. I will try to

will continue to say so , and you obviously decide. but I will reiterrate even in the face of your "nobody is 
good enough argument." keeping foremost in my mind that you and I have only beeen shown a very tiny 
handful of people. 4. I find the friction over fees , counterproductive, in an attempt to avoid it I had 
suggested a multi year deal early on. you rejected it. I then suggested, and urged you to have an option at a 
fixed fee , you also rejected that .you wanted the fee payment only at the end I argued but ,conceded. I 
suggested a structure that tom didn't like, you rejected it. 5 I suggest you make a fair proposal.- that i can 
either accept or reject. some payment up front this time is a requirement. I am willing to modify any outstanding 
obligations. - there are creative ways to assure you of your desired characterization of those payments. 6 you 
should open accts at Deutsh. and goldman. I am told that eilleen has set up over one hundred bank acccts for 
you???!!. few relevant 7 you should immediatly demand a list of all her acct authorites , exec poistions

Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO

With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many 
that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023299 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying " but Leon 
said " or" its on Leon's desk etc" , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023300 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine. 
We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called" 
advisors" however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023304 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked ! " were they deducted " not 2 is there a benefit" !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never 
got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word" I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed .

Transaction complete ! 
When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times 
that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many 
friends and didnt want money to interefer with our unique relationship. For five years you had the kind but 
goofy Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting, legal, investments, reporting, trusts etc. When I told 
you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you admonished me for" speaking out of 
both sides of my mouth" . With regard Brad Wechsler, there is no " both sides. ". I have 
consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to 
help convince him to take the role , promising him a postion to manage mirage investments I sent you a note 
saying instead you should pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year 
now.. Brad, not me was tasked with hiring new people and as you wanted him to take ownership of the 
staff,he conducted many interviews, you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that he had 
had six months and had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income 
tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. ,( last nov ) 11 million found in dormant accounts 
and 4 million in the drawer. errors in cash flow both personal and Phaidon. Oversight on new grats first at 22 
and then at 19 that were done without my consulatation were resolved only as aresult of my intervention. . 600 
million in after tax savings was just accomplished. 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his total and 
utter incompetence was brought clearly, front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he is, 
then it is certainly not by much, A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his 
stupiditly whenever he gets a chance. 
A critical example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of care 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023307 
and attention to details and mechanics. with regard Phaidon I was not shown one single document, not 
one.!! Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and his so called" advisors" however as he was out of the 
office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the 
situation in your office is totally ludicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - 
of things I thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome and 
inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, 
(my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all 
done.( the office was told by Brad not to share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as to 
what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the office. a little 
man , using your power, to appear larger. Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is 
a huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 million in deductions Im told 
were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit 
) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they said that is the only real question you were 
focused on ! " were they deducted" not 2 is there a benefit" !! I asked for the balance sheet and P and L 
for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never got one?" though 9.8 
million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo fired after only 3 
months., no clue. fyi artspace financials are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of 
what got done and did not, i received the email from Brad basicailly mind you own business, so much was 
promised. !!! 
As in your words probably your closest friend and in order to turn the page. I hope the following to 
be constructive 
Here is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered 
and structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK, its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! I suggest again 
that you re-do bank loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no 
longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for 
executor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed 
ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make 
decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out 
estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled 
out was his own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A strategy of the use of art should be 
implemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. . boat 
consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA, BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you might consider a 
Rothshcild bank transaction they have 150 b and a distribution network with no products , private 
bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk 
about Rowen request re Athene , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you 
delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully 
understand ) . you unilaterally changed changed our agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and 
out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the 
artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023308 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word" I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out 
my understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just 
completed. though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked 
out I was the first to say, it is too much money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed. 
including Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated 
formula. - I was never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane, or 
an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I 
provided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 
i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then 
told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question 
that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including any wayt

agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, 
Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great deal 
of detailed time. I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction which you 
saved 600 million in tax. even if as you say it could be 20 years away, ( i hope longer) discounted to today is 
a savings of 300 million . for some reason you chose to ignore our agreements , verbal written and emailed - 
and decided that it was only worth 8 million dollars to you.. ( assuming phaidon -richard happens. the 
calculation that you can see is a 24 m savings not including artspace and debt benefits- certain to come later

Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great 
deal of my detailed time. I do not know how, and even, if ,to move forward - . After months of hearing that 
you would have no problem paying a large fee if you could only ascertain value. The last transaction. a 
transaction which you saved over 600 million in tax. declared bullet proof by your attnys, and even if you 
want to disoccount for its future realization, creating a savings of over 300 million real dollars. For some

wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It 
had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was 
provided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told 
me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid, (and even that 
was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did 
brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it 
would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were 
never consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the 
detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the 
transaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re 
only paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or 
Rothschild transaction.

you've agreed that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023312 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their 
financial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad 
document after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time 
with" its gettting better" no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. 
of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to 
you and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks 
of his editing, the consistant but "inexplicable "missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, 
( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like 
you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist. 
not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last 
night, " no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest " . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant 
reminders i spoke to him , he knows little of either transaction except for over view, never saw pahidon 
anything except projections until yesterday ? ?and this after your clear admonition etc. re the trading 
accounts no activity, at all, 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please . 
you asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were 
never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a 
ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not 
notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He 
told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any 
other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume 
Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious 
issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility because it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both said ," its on us", but... the 
equivalent of your art consultant pointing to a picasso and calling it a renoir. then a brancusi and calling it a 
michaelangelo. those were the types of erros that i saw immediatily, you said give them more time. at least 
they saw it was a painting and not a photo? 
being weaned of our biz /pay realtionship has been our mutual goal. However since novemebr, you chose to 
do so by ignoring' our agreement re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of large payments for 
large value, ( 37 percent was our number ). chose to pay me a number picked by what appears to be only by 
whim,- have yet to justify it except for telling me that you and Brad Karp talked.. . 
What should we do? the next two years in biz world appears to both you and I , very fragile. Im happy to 
have brad sit in ?

i thought the transactions were worth. far less than full. alan etc. , had you said i will pay you only 20. i 
would have said ill pass. you never told me that 50-60 the number that i put on the table at the very beginning 
was not right, you asked that i lay out my plan step by step. and what i believe would have been the fair thing 
to do is say to me, I will pay you only 20 if you do as i ask, not tell me for the first time only after i laid it 
all out. had it not been you, i would have required payment in escrow. BEFORE fyi the reason I sent you

Tenancy in common is a type of shared ownership of property, where each owner owns a share of the 
property. Unlike in a joint tenancy, these shares can be of unequal size, and can be freely transfered to other 
owners both during life and via a will. Even if owners own unequal shares, however, all owners have the right 
to occupy and use all of the property.

glad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money 
discussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re-
do family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with your " payment " last year 
we agreed. no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize that though I ve done 
quite a lot this year already , it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to remind me- you've paid a 
great deal of money to date. that being said - If you want my involvement moving foward, I suggest 
you pay my regular 1 fee of 40 m. 20 now. 20 on completion or as per the invoice issues at the end of last 
year pay 30 all at once. - 
To help out . im keenly aware of your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kind payment - real 
estate ( Miami )„art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the preferred 
cash. Get rid of Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the right guy at the top. you 
entire accounting needs to be re done. , office downsized, reporting re done. meetings to recitify, categlorize 
, the various docs re appollo, rowen, suydam, alan etc. Brad can direct investment guys, ( hopefully) my 
people will be in your office for a few months . reorganizing IF you decide not to pay I fully understand, as I 
m sure you will re my no longer spending any serious time on these things. 
Of course re any non financial issues, I am always there for you and will continue to be the best friend I can

he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things that he

he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out what we want to do

I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow your

Subject: 
To: Melanie Spinella 
Lets start. I am aware that you are currently angry at the world. . me, karp wechsler. even 
yourself, all willing absorbers of the current high heat. (though you ,calling me ,Debra, did take away some 
of the sting ) I am sorry to see you this way. 
emblematic; I was asked to opine on whether to hire castrucci. an hour after I gave a preliminary yes. . I 
called you then texted you that i had thought more about it and changed my mind. The next day brad called 
and asked for my vote. I told him ,in no uncertain terms it is a no , I categorically vote no. I called 
you . you came to see me. I said it was a bad idea. you said you were going to do it anyway , I said and 
followed up in writing IT IS A MISTAKE . and added Please don't come back to me with anything suggesting 
otherwise , you and I should be clear I think it is wrong . A very strong NO. you of course can hire whomever 
you like. 
early on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well informed to 
say the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk, and Ralph Lerner had 
to know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved better ,should get better 
people and no , I am not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason you have hired whomver you 
could find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far, not the best place to try to save money ) 
Joslin- who you say I hired. I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin over 
some woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range at under 
300k. I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality person, that was 
years ago. I have sent over a hundred emails to you clearly saying he needs to be closely managed by 
better professionals. initially, that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after, brad. john etc. THere are 
many emails each and every month from me, telling you , he is slipping failing cracking fragile. . crazy, nuts, 
heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE ACTION! when I pressured him for accurate numbers, 
you told him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me. . When I continued to press for accuracy from 
your office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and i should let brad communicate any requests, ( 
you now tell me " we know what Brad is"?). When I told you you office needs to be reviewed and changed you 
told me i was being destructive rather than constructive, when i ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to 
protect you, told him that his numbers were wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate 
resignation and now have an affirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap. 
I did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment for me 
, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay, has fallen by the 
wayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know 
was not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable, was your justification 
though, for non - full payment ) 
Hopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined repeatedly with the 
admonition that that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our 
friendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023316 
the financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I repeated my concern. THe current circumstance is distressing to me , I 
have done my utmost to keep you safe. and will continue to do so. reckless choices in accounting or 
otherwise does not bode well. at each turn I have put your interests first, including in some instances 
attempting to fight your choices. 
your current circumstance needs nuanced attention. as you know, there are a few areas with very serious 
consequences. whether it be , having Ada, form grats without review, brad doing phaidon without review. 
payments make without review.merely in order to be weaned, is one more high risk choice. review of outside 
accounting firms , CANNOT be done by brad. to have your accounting dept sit in on Alans trust accounting 
lecture. in order to learn the filed is reminiscent of elieen reading the tax regs. ( she also was going to take a 
course)

Subject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
To: Melanie Spinella 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to 
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show 
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I 
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a 
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint 
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review "some things." brad told me 
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea 
. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I 
guess you wanted to save money. ? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie 
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part 
time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again 
?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were 
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed 
over and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you 
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my 
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now 
If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH 
assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed 
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought 
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax 
and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household 
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. 
My goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it 
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my 
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that 
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023318 
anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i 
agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can 
oversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i 
would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. 
-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no 
judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side 
on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months. 
11:21 PM (13 hours ago)

Jeffrey, 
I created applications one week ago at NDCAS ( doctor of naturopathic medicine centralized application service

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023319 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect

that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.

sent to you JAN 29th 2016 
you've agreed that 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility, your children will inherit it, in order to oversee their 
financial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad 
document after another for over a year, no getting away from it,, bad cash flows no new IT, each time 
with" its gettting better" no in fact -! its not. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. 
of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to 
you and me , after, holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks 
of his editing, the consistant but "inexplicable "missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, 
( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like 
you ,also give points for effort. )- ! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??! !I and its core reason to exist. 
not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last 
night, " no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest " . why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant 
reminders your admonition etc. the trading accounts ? 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please . 
you asked, - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were 
never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't as a 
ceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not 
notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He 
told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any 
other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision, the tenants in common structure I assume 
Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious 
issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility

Subject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
To: Melanie Spinella______________________________ 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive, the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to 
modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me, just a bit more red., here let me show 
you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I 
vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work. . you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a 
reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint 
over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review "some things." brad told me 
,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea 
. Having them review things without even asking for my input, or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023325 
guess you wanted to save money. ? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie 
. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there, joslin part 
time, but relied on. joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again 
?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, it was the first thing on my list of things that were 
needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of, though its prophylactic quality has been discussed 
over and over during the past three years. computers do not read Page Six. the women at the IRS do. ! you 
said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my 
artwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now 
If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH 
assignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed 
very far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought 
in at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax 
and compliance, investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. . household 
classifcations and reporting with a system of best practices. 
My goal is clear - to end, not extend, our financial interactions, you will have a machine that works , it 
will not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my 
works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear. that 
you have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds 
anything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you and i 
agreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, you can decide that brad , tom, and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can 
oversee your audits . they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i 
would be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story. 
-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no 
judgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them. not my role I am always on your side 
on the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you 've had a rough 15 months.

IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked ! " were they deducted " not 2 is there a benefit" !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never 
got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023326 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid

visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on

the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word" I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
left me felling quite uneasy.

After I spoke to you both, I excused myself from a dinner with some heads of state to walk into the bathroom 
to make some calls re 8865. I wondered whether any group that we could assert had control had filed in the 
past years. I called Fenn and he told me- yes.???!! he said that on friday, for the first time he learned that 
AGM was not delinquent at all. and had filed.!! I asked why no one had ever told me or given me the 
purported justification for no filings in the past for the founders. and he said Well, sorry, it was discussed 
on fridays call. ? the call i was not on . not invited to ,the call wechsler didnt listen in and joslin didnt 
transmit , if it is true. Im also now told there is a note from Deloitte re 13 and 14 that says the founders DO 
NOT have to file. but fenn could not tell me who wrote it and said Deloitte says to ignore it. , that s why they 
are pushing now. 
Melanie Spinella 
steps 1 8865 has many exemptions for filing, let see if we can find one . ( an elegant position might be josh 
and agm if he is panicked and leave us out ). The requirments are FACT specific , so without the facts we still 
have nothing. fenn said he has now put someone on it 
2 leon, I suggest need to focus on 1040 , 2015. , we may even consider filing the minimum 8865 , 
and wait until we are sure of our specific requirements, and file an amendment for 15 as well as past. no harm

To: Melanie Spindle___________________________ 
Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. . "" planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023330 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.

I have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin 
castrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in 
another only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually sent 
emails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be saddled 
with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get it. I tell you 
this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. 
A story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt 
help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I 
tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little 
nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump 
looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for 
your office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of 
unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than 
you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. 
Barry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments 
etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i presented to 
you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil 
funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. 
Tuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are 
filing documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes

To: Melanie Spinella - 
Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait. 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wrote : 
With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many 
that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to be upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my 
involvement ) I am also aware however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the 
complexities who else can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. children with good intentions are running around, sniping , nitpicking with 
little direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would 
report to him. Eileen included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my first choice as I 
prefer only being responsible and standing behind my own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer 
be transmitted to reflect status stated by others ) 
With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to 
think through the problem creatively. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you 
might find very costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but 
would require my teams doing the work , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator, not sure 
what role you prefer for Eileen as you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich your controller 
stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gregory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public profile needs to be taken into 
consideration. 
TODAY 
With your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she 
continued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and each 
time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g.....y!! No one was 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023332 
hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even now , Brad, a very 
nice man, is not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him. and his new 
staff. Eileen followed your instructions, not mine, in fact she continued to ignore mine saying " but Leon 
said " or" its on Leon's desk etc" , You would become frustrated when i pointed out each instance, of her 
obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but to save money ,you chose not to hire my team. I 
was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own team. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by 
me„ detailed but ignored by her. ( except in the instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the 
weeks of grunt work ),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation 
,starting from where you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell of a deal. -- negotiating 
down my original amount requested, calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was 
partially my fault. ( though in that specific example, I had never been asked to do more than merely provide 
you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked again for my 
guidance along the way. ). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way „suggesting now, that your 
Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly is a bit much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
In order to move forward 
I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal attention 
and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues last year. . As you 
are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I have decided i will 
have this year for my time. (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also ask that you keep in mind 
that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your understanding of the final 
payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have answered every 
call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and over/ until once again, I was 
forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made serious dollar and time concessions 
last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but I am, under no 
circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which 
was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you 
found yourself last year, and in fact due predominately to its seriousness, and those very circumstances I took 
extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed I had you over a barrel, ( a horrible position to be in with my 
very close friend.), unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear 
of your own design ) 
I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art 
partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so. . ( 
FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title. ) You will also recall that you 
required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was 
never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of course should 
make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past agreement at all. I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement right out of the box. you said 
you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in excess of even my own exalted opinion 
of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of 
our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. 
However, As my best student , and my only one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the 
required work yourself I can put my whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. 
share moments ideas etc. . I am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route. 
always. It will take a great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine.

Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is not certainly not by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his so called" 
advisors" however as he was out of the office during the most important transaction of the year, I did get 
to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the 
list I provided to Brad last December - things I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your 
office still remains virtually undone. 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without 
brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is 
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger. 
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is 
rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they 
said that is the question they get asked ! " were they deducted " not 2 is there a benefit" !! I asked for the 
balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never 
got one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing, a construction project run amok, no budget, the coo 
fired after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023334 
The following is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain 
the paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you 
consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank 
loans, no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do 
will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid 
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more 
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art 
division with children in attendance. have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra 
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads 
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant. 
. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation, deal with TRA , BRH , rationalize 
investments, cash flow, reporting, gaming disclosures, foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16,. 
deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed, art partnership, pledges. sell stock, art, deal with phaidon 
debt. athene,? income, capital, foreign, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound 
issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends, corporate 
tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150 b they have a 
distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service, deal with UK 
visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on 
transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about 
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed. 5m woudl be reserved for the 
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and 
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were 
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented. you may recall that 
you appeared offended and said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word" I said no , of course 
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay,. 
From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed . 
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were 
discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a 
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not 
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three 
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made 
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they 
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided. then and 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m would be paid, (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I 
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to 
send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were never consummated, i would not be 
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and 
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had 'ready heavily 
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement. I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023335 
left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens 
drawer.. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murphy is not an accountant. redid your 
gagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce, set up gift trust. stopped ada from including 
multiple times things not in your interest, dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in 
deductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems, . . reorg bad art purchases , funds taken„ 
charibale decustions , helped with fincnacil sttment gamoing commions fling. . boat deductions, rescued stock 
from grats.. may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay 
more. . on april 15. I sent an email detailing payments owed if i could figure out the basis issue, please see 
attached,. 
questions you might ask your team ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&l for REgan arts. . doesnt exist 
ask. either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why 
the proposed phaidon transaction DOES not work. . as them to give you a plan for the plane. ? ask them to 
show you the cash mgmt for over 100 million dollars. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one 
year. . the approval process for payables. . the cash flow projections? assumptions? ask for a comparative 
review of investments. ask haperin to describle to you in any detail BRH, the major asset of his two biggest 
clients, tax basis, disposiotion in the estate. . etc. ask brad to show you the liquidation of the inteveing art space 
cos? . 
Last year you asked, for my help I told you I preferred not as we would be better off having no financial 
intereactions. the risk was not worth it. You told me that as my friend i had to do it I agreed., here we are 
in what I find to be an awkward situation. the transactions that i decvised were used , our agreement was 
ignored. and im not sure how to respond.

okay, its time for you to decide how you would like to move forward. ( fyi get your money from the 
1031 . the screw up is only one of many,) If you decide to move foward on decanting. phaidon, note basis 
estate update , each requires many carefully orchestrated detailed steps. and precision. there are hundreds of 
millions in saving if done correctly and a huge mess if not. If you want me and my colleagues to do it,

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i 
have been saying to you for quite a while now. Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible, the charts he 
prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten 
along quite well, I thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number. no cash flow 
after weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy 
office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay, admittedly no change for the year. . plane not 
done. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july . . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said 
three, . i didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing 
about. tax issues. 1031. neg basis, note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!) 
. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected ( they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When 
we met in your lobby he seems surprised that i was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. . . 
the savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion, real money if you do phaidon which i see no 
reason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you 
through the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain. 
Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you. 
You wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal . . its silly. its not 
how i work or a reflection of our friendship, my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but 
at the same time leaving you in good shape. I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this 
year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give 
you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023337 
that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it was may in my house 
when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up a parallel. office, somenoe 
like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two bookeepers and two office 
admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will be incolved in art partnership. if 
you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to add in that regard ,except to be able to 
account for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin in any deal. 
Alternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done. and 
you and I can kibbitz about it all. structures outcomes risk, museums. charity, ( joslins answer by the way 
was I had asked how much charity was leon planining to give this year , ( the 2 m ) he didnt include your 
foundation or the payment to me, or from debra and you??!!

good enough argument." keeping foremost in my mind that you and I have only beeen shown a very tiny 
handful of people. 4. I find the friction over fees , counterproductive, in an attempt to avoid it I had 
suggested a multi year deal early on. you rejected it. I then suggested, and urged you to have an option at a 
fixed fee , you also rejected that .you wanted the fee payment only at the end I argued but ,conceded. I 
suggested a structure that tom didn't like, you rejected it. 5 I suggest you make a fair proposal.- that i can

Mark was here this morning , the proposed transactions are extremely complex . and would take a great deal 
of detailed time. I do not know how, and if ,to move forward - our last transaction. a transaction which you 
saved 600 million in tax. even if 20 years away, ( i hope longer) even discounted is a 300 million 
savings . for that you ignored our agreements , verbal written and emailed -and decided that it was only 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023338 
worth 8 million dollars. ( assuming phaidon srichard happens. 24 m savings not including artspace and debt 
benefits certain to come later ) FYI the phaidon transaction cannot happen as currently comtemplated IT 
will not work . NOT 
When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told you multiple times 
that i thought it was a very bad idea, in that I preferred to have no financial interactions. I dont have many 
friends and didnt want money in any way to interfere with our unique relationship. Reminder, For five years 
you had the kind but goofy Eileen Alexandersson as the sole manager of your accounting, legal, investments. 
reporting, trusts etc. When I first told you in no uncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you 
admonished me for" speaking out of both sides of my mouth" . With regard Brad Wechsler, there has never 
been a " both sides. ". I have consistantly maintained since day one that he was highly unsuited for the 
job. When you initially asked me to help convince him to take the role , promising him a position to manage 
mirage investments I sent you a note saying that instead of hiring him you should pay up and get first class 
people. I have reiterated the same message for over a year now. . Brad, not me ,was tasked with hiring new 
people , according to his org chart.(nauseating ) and as you wanted him to take ownership of the staff,he 
conducted many interviews alone. . you may recall that as late as may, you told him in my presence that 
though six months had passed he had not hired anyone. since then I have rectified errors in sales tax, use 
tax, income tax, fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions missed errors of millions on the 
returns. ,( april ) Oversight on new grats- first at 22 and then at 19 that were done without my consultation and 
needed to be resolved soley as a result of my last minute intervention. . 600 million in after tax savings was 
just accomplished, though you left the 30 million outstanding that I had said should only be done" if" that was 
my additional fee. not used for non biz purposes and not art. 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less when 
artspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of money 
wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally changed our 
agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m,? i would receive only a 
third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt, and the art space investment will also lead to a write- off of 
another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most people to pay 
their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies are implemented. you may recall that you appeared offended and said " are you suggesting that i 
would go back on my word" I said no , of course not! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is 
that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay. 
I include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just 
completed.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the first to point 
out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore 
From day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely fair price for 
all the transactions just completed. including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of range. in 
fact, alternative methods of payment. ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( 
ie including keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided, only because you 
specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given 
access to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. ( as i said more needed 
on phaidon ) . I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , 
though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a 
unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of 
your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch 
reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were 
wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with the deal was known . It 
had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was 
provided. then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow You told 
me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid, (and even that 
was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did 
brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023339 
would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactions were 
never consummated, i would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the 
detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the 
transaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re 
only paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or 
Rothschild transaction.

glad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money 
discussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving forward. re-
do family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with your " payment " last year 
we agreed. no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize that though I ve done 
quite a lot this year already , it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to remind me- you've paid a 
great deal of money to date. that being said - If you want my involvement moving foward, I suggest 
you pay my regular 1 fee of 40 m. 20 now. 20 on completion or as per the invoice issues at the end of last 
year pay 30 all at once. - 
To help out . im keenly aware of your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kind payment - real 
estate ( Miami )„art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the preferred 
cash. Get rid of Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the right guy at the top. you 
entire accounting needs to be re done. , office downsized, reporting re done. meetings to recitify, categlorize 
, the various docs re appollo, rowen, suydam, alan etc. Brad can direct investment guys, ( hopefully) my 
people will be in your office for a few months . reorganizing IF you decide not to pay I fully understand, as I 
m sure you will re my no longer spending any serious time on these things. 
Of course re any non financial issues, I am always there for you and will continue to be the best friend I can 
be 
Steve jobs said that everyday he woke up , and asked himself, if he knew he was going to die tomorow , would 
he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things that he 
really wanted to. after three days of getting back an answer of no, he would change what he was going to do. . 
he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out what we want to do 
long term so my thinking is that we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome serendipity. 
I think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow your 
family to get screwed by your partners on death. Alan, for years told me that paul weiss had drawn the 
docs so no issue but when recently pushed by my new fire drill he asked akin to draft.?! PLease ask brad 
about why he keeps talking about flow. I dont know what he means, its so silly. . this is only about money 
control and protection. 
I am leaving monday night now. free to speak in the afternoon

Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for 
you. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before 
him. what would you like me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i 
outlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you 
like ) . Brad wechsler was never up to the task. sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a 
long time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and 
Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get 
him ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, He complained for over a year, re his 
direction by eileen and ada, and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of 
warnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told 
you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for 
me and that brad needs to pays him . 
. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up 
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen ) but 
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you 
bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect 
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out 
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really 
dangerous mess. . Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said, I take no 
responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that was my opinion 
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he 
too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re 
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and 
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess. 
That being said, the tasks at hand are the following. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023341 
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully 
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would 
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I am 
concerned re brad taking barrys place re )(XXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn 
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets. trust valuations, are all a part. Barry will need 2 months 
to just get his arm around what is there, this is before any needed modifications., 
a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts, filing 
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into 
new plan. . "" planning. art partnership engagement.. , airplane re-do. , buying another. . ? boat 
sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years over due. . an accounting system. fire john 
.. joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and. except for heather everyone should be replaced with 
new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize, cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock 
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you 
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. . CANNOT!!! this will be very detailed work. . a self 
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit. or contain it. . . you will need 
3 new hires .a s there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you 
know. He will need to be trained. note 
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin,: im glad 
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense, in fact I take comfort in the fact that after 
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more. 
I expect as a friend you will understand that 
I will no longer, not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long 
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul 
weiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin„ no one. needs to end. . you and I had 
previously agreed no more of that, and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can 
not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you 
wont want to pay, so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge 
If I can find the time to work, on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope 
you understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as 
to avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with 
you , I find it very distasteful. . so to be clear , my terms are as follows . I will only work for the usual 40 
million per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months 
thereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin if i am able in January. I will immediately stop 
work, if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15 , it will be 10 
million, paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with 
professionals overseen by Barry. ( hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any 
painting you could possible own. . no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the 
hour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say. 
her the last two places. ?

Leon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS , see if you can understand it !!!. lye asked for a

incompetence in your family office.. Alans words " but I was told that.. , but I was told by the office (sic) 
that ... , BUT i was told by joslin,. , but I was told by. " why is leon blaming me for .." . I ve have always 
given you my best advice, If you reflect on your financial life, you have been kept safe , had remarkable 
results and no disasters. I have repeatedly urged you to get rid of the people in your office. , you 
have repeatedly chosen to ignore my advice , you told me last week that the emotional reason was in order 
to be weaned off my group and not have to pay my high fees. ( though ignoring the benefit of between 1.5 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023342 
and 2b to the better. ) . and no explosions. You have email after email ,where i remind you that I am not 
your bookkeeper or accountant ( in brads corporate speak his" finance dept ??!!) that it should be redone .I 
have reviewed a multitude of the silly reports given to you and have pointed out the continued numerous 
inaccuracies . your question" so what if the numbers are off, so what if the categories are off whats the big 
deal??. I suggest you de risk you finances and make the tough decisions necessary - pay the right amounts ( 
high) to get the work done properly or , you are, Im afraid, certain to get an unhappy answer.. tom will be 
back from vacation, this week.

Leon, 
Yesterday, I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and 
you and i will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing 
the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, might be 
helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500 million dollars per 
year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, 
a desire to enter into others. A panoply of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , planes. 
boats homes. . trusts ,grats. a crazy number of bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 
page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. construction consultants bill payers, 
home mgmt.,vast multitude ofllc's , including foreign, and with all that you only have a combined overhead 
of less that 3 million dollars. 
I have previously sent you the very same note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights 
. I wrote it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised 
as one of your concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I 
fear may later turn out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those 
things that are not. below you will find details of things that I thought needed to be done, so that you 
wouldn't find yourself in the very place where you currently find yourself however ,you chose to defer 
many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art 
partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber emails all carried with it a clear warning 
that you needed to do something re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you chose to wait.

and strongly, " Ralph wrote the book, Tom has been doing it for 15 years and Eileen ran the trading desk at 
Morgan Stanley. " Ada who had been working on all your documents for years while at the bank had 
been brought in- house but created more issues that didn't exist. and phaidon was its own animal 
Dec 13. you were again annoyed that i said that they needed to be replaced and said "i was talking out of both 
sides of my mouth." first time ( email available) 
Jan 14, you decided that no third year was necessary for my help. and i told you i thought that unwise and 
even suggested giving you an option at 40 m so there would be no tension 
Mar 14, I told you that to do the job right, my team would need to do it. not yours it would not be 
inexpensive, but it would get done properly, you chose not to do itand said lets wait and see 
April 14. We agreed to clean up various past mess.with the end of my work OCT 15th only then would i get

I am sorry. I realize you are under tremendous stress, In Bedford you asked me for my help I could not have 
been more clear that thought it very unwise as in my words I did not want any financial arrangment between 
us, it risked conflict and tension what neither of us needed more of and did not want to risk torturing our 
friendship into the likes of the kind you have with Mark nor Josh, : now,- I dont have anyone but you yelling 
at me, in my own house. no one. it is highly unpleasant but I am trying my best to be understanding. sorry 
. From the outset and as you told me you recall. i tsuggested that three years should be the period of 
engagment. as planning is not a one year excericse . you declined to commit to a number of alternatives 
presented to you for payment of the third year. I told you in nov that you should decide whether to now sign 
on for that very third year as the vast majority of my work ended on oct 15. you recently told me you thought i 
was kidding. .you hired brad patting him on the back that after months of inquiry he can now, finallly tell you 
which Ilc owns the cars?? 
once he has all the facts what next ??. whether or not you refer to a portion of the third year as after care, or 
whatever term besides 'scoundrel you choose to use, I m not sure why you assume now it should be free.( 
I HATE THIS CONVERSATION < HATE , ) and i heard you when you said you told me what was I work 
still to be done you thought valuable enough to pay for. please tell me. and then we can decide the next steps 
if any. I consider my work rarefied art. I guess the value is in the eye of the beholder. IT reminds me of

your personal bottom line has increased dramatically, if you had thought of me as your partner in this

If you recall, you wanted me to be paid , unlike others at the END of my work. we discussed this ad 
nauseum, and agreed OCT 15, last year was the end. You had wanted more comfort initially on the art 
partnership so that date was delayed. It has now been six monhts since then, your concept of aftercare. . for 
free. was already unique, in your words this has to have an end.( weaned ) if the actions of josh and 
mark led to one hundred million dollars , what would be their share. Im not sure why it is different in your 
mind, but i respect the fact that it is, Is it because their work seems harder. it cannot be simply because they 
devote more time to you .or it appears to involve more effort. I am happy to continue to play a partnership 
role. as I have been in many areas of your life.. I am also happy to move on and have no more of these 
emails. I find them as tedious as you do. if you prefer a partnership structure, ok with me, I tried to minimize 
the amount of money i would recieve by making it a flat fee . as i wanted you to feel good and have no second 
thoguths somehow if the payment comes from a partnership structure you seem relaxed as opposed to writing 
a check, I focus on trust and friendship first, and the fact that you don't include josh and mark in that 
category, gives me great pause . I proposed 33 percent of money made for you.. in the past you agreed that 
amount. it will be huge, but ok with me, I can talk today at 945 as you suggested. or if you woudl rather

Subject: Picasso agreement - question 
To: Brad Wechsler L 
<jeevacation@gmail.com> 
_ 
1>, "Jeffrey Epstein cjeevacation@gmail.com)" 
Brad and Jeffrey, 
Gagosian has one final change to the Picasso agreement. As you know, we have structured this agreement with 
the Buyer as either Narrows Holdings LLC or AP Narrows LP, and given both of those entities the right to 
assign the agreement to any one among Leon, Debra, the kids, or family trusts including AP01 and AP02. 
Gagosian wants us to agree that, if Narrows/AP Narrows assigns the agreement to someone else, Narrows/AP 
Narrows "shall not be discharged from its liabilities under this Agreement and shall remain primarily liable to 
Seller." Larry is concerned that we might assign to the Black kids or to a trust that has no assets, and then when 
he has to sue us because we don't make the final payment of the purchase price but have possession of the art, 
the entity/person to which we have assigned the agreement has no money. 
I think this is a valid concern and that we should agree to it. 
However, Ada just reminded me that it is possible that Narrows/AP Narrows (really, Leon's) agreeing to 
effectively guarantee payment by the assignee might be considered a gift to the assignee. In the discussions 
with Alan about rearranging the bank loan once AP Narrows is operational, Alan agreed that there could be 
deemed to be a potential gift from Leon to AP01/AP02 if Leon provides a guarantee to the bank that is for the 
benefit of the trusts as partners in AP Narrows. Alan suggested mitigating this risk by having the trusts sign 
side agreements with Leon which say that if AP Narrows defaults on the loan and the bank goes after Leon on 
his guarantee, the trusts will make him whole. 
This issue only arises if we assign the agreement. The risk is also limited in time because it would run from the 
moment we assigned the agreement until the final payment is made, which even if we assigned immediately 
after signing, would only be 11 1/2 months. 
Shall I agree to Gagosian's request that Narrows/AP Narrows remain liable even if they assign the agreement? 
I'm in the office if you would like to discuss this, but I would love to get back to Gagosian ASAP so we can 
have this agreement signed today. 
Thanks,

I think that Melanie should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an 
apollo server. 
There is not even a good solution. all have substantial risks, we are dealing with a wholly unpredictable and 
bad minded person. I and Brad can only make suggestions/actions each less than stellar. - that being 
said we should do our best to have all the facts . options etc. and to distinguish fact from opionion As the 
consequences of any decision is likely to have some very bad parts , Leon needs to be cognizant of as much as 
the downside as we can adequately foresee.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023356 
NO sorry not until i hear from leon 
leon. to be fair, I had sent the first note to you one year ago . stating that my work would come to an end on 
oct 15. that day had meaning as everything would be closed, you asked that i continue to help brad. as of 
nov though he would officially start in jan. I said ok, but..... " you told me to continue as we would work 
something out" I told you my fee then was 40. feb you came with ben while kathy ruemmler was here. and 
said next week, debra got bad news. and I quickly prioritzed not adding stress to your situation. I wont 
regurgitate the interim, though millions of dollars were saved since. millions. . it is now one year later and you 
propose 10 mIllion , plus a contingent fee . I have said that i would work with you, and if contingent and a 
percentage of something. I strongly believe that is not in your interest. I continue to put our friendship first 
and dont want you to write a check for over 100million andthe i will have to listen to lewie for the next few 
years. but if you prefer over my objection a percentage deal then it should be of all savings not just 
phaidon. ( a random concept) . The idea that i am somehow even marginally responsible for neither you nor 
heather, ever telling me that there was an unresolved issue, though you said you had been pinged a number of 
times is emblematic . 
I can do a call with you and Karp. anytime you like today, but i can assure you 100 percent that there is no 
light between our positions. ZERO. and he is ready to do his best to try to explain it to you.

I think you should consider the fact that your family office will be the most central component of what you 
leave to your children , wife heirs. it is the core of your assets. your art might be sold. your houses may lie 
empty, the apollo stock could be sold. you will pass on your office, . it will be the primary player in your 
estate tax. probate, transition. Brad has taken it from a D minus to a C minus, If I were you I would set the 
goal of an A. just like your paintings. . Like a house you could attempt to renovate it. it will take more time 
and money. or. in essence as I suggested in dec of 13, start from scratch. A financail head of 
office. - brad could move to being richards replacment as trustee. . barry cohen would be perfect but carries 
the trustee taint now. . take a tax partner from a major firm. to replace joslin, cost 1 + mil . keep heather 
and ssmantha. . bring in full time IT person. ASAP . your lighting contractor in your new townhouse has 
better IT than your multi billlion dollar antique opersation. data breaches are not your concern, precision is. . 
either re do the office layout. or get enterly new space. the proposals to focus on following on a monthly basis 
the values of all your current investments is an example of misplaced prioirties. . Your office is the heart of 
the familys financial life and temp future, it needs a heart operation 
Date: Mon, Oct 19, 2015 at 5:10 PM 
Subject: 
To: Melanie Spinella 
Radical but my preferred idea. . START from total scratch. there is absolutely nothing worth keeping in 
your family office except for heather, nothing at all . I remember when i bought my first house in order to 
renovate and jack robertson said forget it. knock it down start again, I could n't believe it. but he was 
right. Like your tax returns that were done in triplicate. TOM RICH ALAN. . tom and rich were not really 
useful in the end. Alan was the only smart one. you should in my opinion Start a brand new office. hire 
cfo. bring joe over, heather and samantha, run parallel for 6 months and close down the mess of elysium 
forever, leave your kids a functioning operation professionally constructed and managed. NOT BY ME!!! 
LAst nov i laid out priorities IT , being the first nothing as of today. in July I said focus on airplane as a test 
. to examine procedure and proficiency, so far mostly a waste of resources time people etc. Only last week 
told debra owns 49 percent of plane. no IT to speak of. bens house unaccounted for. tax returns very 
very sloppy, . boat still argued as third home. . pilots bonuses? , structure unkown by all. cash sitlling at the 
same time loans outstanding. 
Phaidon, looks like close to breakeven in a few years. others totally unknown. Query, do you really want 
this ? : I m not sure how you both want to have an investment office and have cash flow being eaten by 
publishing and loans amounts outstanding increased by art. --interest rates will be going up.- . your plane will 
cost 10 million to refinance - so will boat if sold next year-. art space and regan , both needs more cash. with 
little return, taxes , art purchases . Part of radical solutition is to sell publishing.altogether. (are the children 
really interested.) . restrucuture plane from scratch. layers unncessary. simplify crazy structure s bank 
accounts trading accounts accounts payble. credit cards. etc. The best way to wean yourself away from me 
is to have someone else do the whole thing from scratch. . move brad to be the replacement for Richard. . he is 
nice but this is not what he does. Him saying it is s0000 fucked up to me , was only an echo of me sayint it to 
you.

Subject: RE: 
To: "jeffrey E." <jeevacation@gmail.com> 
Hi Jeffrey, 
As you will recall, we used this same exchange agent last year on the Calder 1031. At the time, we discussed 
the merits of using a gallery versus a commercial exchange agent and my recommendation to Leon was to use a 
gallery. I felt that there were advantages to using a commercial exchange agent instead of a gallery on the 1031 
side (e.g., less likelihood of a breach of confidentiality, IRS familiarity with CDEC in the event of an audit, 
security of funds), but that a commercial exchange agent gave us less comfort on the sales tax side. Leon did 
not want to use a gallery because he was concerned about confidentiality and he did not want to have to ask a 
gallery that he did not do much business with to act as exchange agent. 
When Leon first discussed the exchange for the Cezannes with me a few weeks ago, I asked him if he wanted 
to use the same exchange agent as last year, or if he wanted to use a gallery. I said that a gallery carried little to 
no risk on the sales tax side, but I reminded him that he had not wanted to use a gallery last year for the Calder 
because of confidentiality reasons. He said to use the same exchange agent as before, which made sense to me 
because he was extremely concerned about confidentiality with the purchase of the Cezannes. 
I will find out about sales tax audits and will let you know. The exchange agent has had a New York resale 
certificate since 2014 and has been engaged in art transactions like this since then, but I do not believe they 
have been audited. I will check, though, and I will also ask the Herrick lawyer if any of his clients who have 
done similar deals have been audited. 
Best, 
Heather
