That was fun- definitely the highlight of a day that was not without other interesting moments 
Don't know which was better-- the wholly unexpected surprise reminder (by a prime minister) of my 
boyfriend from 1976( who was in high school, who lived with his doting parents), or , getting creamed on 
my producer's budget but then offered the opportunity to profess poetry for production funds . There may 
be someone as good in New York, but i'll never tell you and you really have a heck of a seminar table 
there . when do we do Whitman's "song of Myself" 1-15 Who else is reading with us? I'm ready . 
A few other follow ups : 
David and Brigid point out that reality tv doesn't cost anything because it is, as it sounds, very low 
budget . No writing , no special expertise or knowledge or research , no archival footage , no copyright 
clearance , no actors , no travel beyond the one location , certainly no clinton or woody allen or 
justice elena kagan or david brooks or Lena Dunham or even Professor New. That said , I think if were 
hiring the crew id do it for less -- probably 1, 250,000 all in . But I haven't won 10 Emmys and David 
has . That has value too. As does wgbh . But I'll be more prepared for the next conversation and want to 
be much more prepared for templeton, so thank you . 
really liked Michael. I would like to send him some stuff , but in googling him I noticed that we have 
the same birthday! May I have his email? 
You are in! Yeay! Lets see what this may mean? improve my numbers and you'll improve your deep 
reading ?
