How to detect and position for a potential Tech Bubble
Our investment strategists recently warned against the risk of an overshoot in US Tech,
as data on valuations, relative performance, and inflows invoke echoes of the late ‘90s.
However, rising Tech vol alongside rising Tech stock prices – a classic sign of an asset
bubble – has yet to materialize, suggesting still early stages of bubble formation.
Derivatives can be a key tool for trading bubbles, allowing investors to capture asset
price upside while mitigating reversal risk. To this end, we like stock replacing FANG
positions or overlaying Tech exposure with Nasdaq 100 (NDX) put spreads. Long
volatility dispersion strategies are particularly well-suited for trading asset bubbles, in
our view, as they can profit from both the inflation and deflation of a bubble without
needing to time the top. Specifically, we like SPX 12M Top50 dispersion to position for
a potential Tech Bubble as (i) the Top50 basket is dominated by Tech stocks, hence
would benefit from any rise in their vol from currently low levels; (ii) the trade would
benefit from any downward pressure on broad-market correlations as Tech stocks
decouple from other large caps; and (iii) the late ‘90s Tech Bubble generated the most
sustained period of elevated S&P vol dispersion in history.
Europe
DTE Sep17 collars can hedge DTE-TMUS merger risk; value in Enel bullish riskies
DTE GY has run too fast, too quick: investors who own stock should consider hedging a
pullback using a Sep17 collar (+17put/-18 call for 46bps) to hedge losses greater than
2.9% while retaining upside to 18 (stock’s ~15yr high is 18.05). Extending our EU equity
vs credit theme to single names, we find Enel 3m bullish risk reversals screen attractive
as Enel’s projected 12m div yield is high versus Enel CDS (suggesting value in owning
equity vs credit) and the price of 3M bullish risk reversals is low (versus other names) as
well as versus history (2 nd 5y percentile).
Asia
Buy best-of puts to cheaply hedge a reversal in the melt-up rally
While still high central bank liquidity may continue to push markets higher, heavy equity
and option positioning suggests the risk of a market reversal. To minimize the cost of
hedges and take advantage of the recent decline in volatility and correlation, we suggest
owning 14-Sep-2017 95% strike best-of puts on KOSPI2/HSI/NKY at 0.8%, a 45%
discount to average vanilla puts.

BofAML GFSI TM X-Asset Risk Landscape
GFSI below ‘normal’ for longest period since summer 2014
The GFSI continued its decline last week, falling to -0.21 as of 2-Jun from -0.17 a week
prior. The indicator last spent a significant proportion of time below -0.2 back in
summer 2014, when cross asset volatility recorded long term lows.
• Equity risks led the broad based decline in stress across asset classes
(Chart 2 and Chart 3), led by equity skew.
• While most stresses fell, crude oil volatility was among the top gainers
(Chart 2) as oil continued its slide despite the May OPEC meeting seeing
agreement for extending production cuts.
• Also, Euro member bond spreads recorded a historically significant move
higher (Chart 5) as the potential for early Italian elections causing political
instability amidst ECB tapering revived concerns about European sovereign risk

How to trade the rise & fall of a potential Tech Bubble
“Alexa, has the Tech Bubble started?”
Our investment strategists recently warned against the risk of an overshoot in Tech,
noting that the longer it takes Central Banks to tighten, the greater the risk of Tech and
Growth stocks entering a speculative frenzy. Data on relative performance, valuation,
and flows are reminiscent to varying degrees of the early stages of a bubble:
• Market cap hegemony: Following the GFC, Tech stocks ousted Financials from
their top position in terms of market cap and now account for 23% of the S&P500,
the highest %-age from any single sector since the dotcom bubble (Chart 7).
• Dazzling growth vs. value outperformance: S&P 500 Growth stocks (SGX) on
aggregate cost ~1.4x as much as their Value counterparts (SVX), the largest
premium since the dotcom bubble (Chart 8). Notably, the S&P 500 Growth index is
dominated by Tech stocks, which account for 36% of its total market cap.
• Third longest streak of monthly gains: In May, the Nasdaq 100 recorded its
seventh consecutive monthly gain, the longest streak since 2009. Remarkably, the
index has managed to establish a longer streak only twice in its history, in 1986 (10
consecutive months) and in 1995 (8 months). The rally in these two episodes
ultimately came to an abrupt halt. However, the index would have substantial
further upside from current levels if it were to achieve similar gains (Chart 9).
• Lofty valuations: The valuation of Tech as measured by price to consensus forward
12M earnings expectations recently hit its highest value since Nov-07 and is
exhibiting signs of acceleration (Chart 10). However, Tech remains far cheaper than
its dotcom bubble highs.
• Irrational exuberance: Inflows to Tech funds are rising at their fastest annualized
rate (25% of AUM) in 15 years, a sign of renewed exuberance.
Chart 7: The last instance where a single sector dominated SPX market
cap as the Tech sector does now was the dotcom bubble era

In addition to strong price performance, lofty valuations, and exuberant inflows, asset
bubbles also tend to have two other hallmarks, best seen through the derivatives lens:
(i) asset volatility rising alongside asset prices (Charts 11 & 12), and (ii) declining
correlation as assets closest to the source of the bubble decouple from those farther
removed (Chart 11).

Weeks from peak
While Nasdaq 100 (NDX) implied volatility has spiked in recent weeks and now trades in
the 94 th percentile as a spread to S&P 500 (SPX) implied volatility (Chart 14), the
absolute level of NDX 3M implied vol remains historically low (2 nd percentile since Jun-
09). In our view, at least for now, the spread widening is more of a response to the
outsized sell-off seen in Tech stocks on 17-May rather than the volatility market trying
to price in the onset of another Tech Bubble. Indeed, the -2.5% drop in the NDX on 17-
May was a six standard deviation (6σ) event relative to trailing realized volatility (and the
fourth worst risk-adjusted daily return since 1985), even more extreme than the 5σ
decline experienced by the S&P.

Hedge near-term reversal risk via FANG stock replacement or NDX put spreads
As we have previously noted, asset bubbles can be notoriously difficult to trade, as
fundamentals give way to chasing higher highs, and derivatives can be a key tool for
capturing asset price upside while mitigating reversal risk.

We continue to like hedging the risk of a US Tech overshoot via stock replacement
strategies, for example, stock replacing long “FANG” positions with either cheap calls on
the individual FANG stocks or with outperformance calls on FANG vs. S&P.

6 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017
For those who wish to remain fully invested and/or seek broader index-level hedges for
Tech positions, we suggest 3M put spreads on NDX for two reasons: (i) our cross-asset
hedging analysis (Chart 15) shows little value in proxy hedging Nasdaq 100 exposure,
even with relatively lower vol S&P options, as the basis risk has tended to be too high
historically for proxy hedging to be reliably beneficial; and (ii) compared to outright puts,
put spreads help limit long exposure to short-dated NDX implied volatility that is low but
not cheap (Chart 14).
Hedge inflation & deflation of a Tech Bubble via SPX 12M Top50 dispersion
Dispersion strategies can be particularly attractive hedges for asset bubbles as
idiosyncratic market moves generate high volatility (to which dispersion is positively
correlated) with a limited rise in correlation (to which dispersion is negatively
correlated). Importantly, as seen from Chart 11, this can occur both during the run-up to
the market peak as well as after the bubble pops. In other words, long vol dispersion
strategies can profit from both the inflation and deflation of an asset bubble, without
requiring an investor to time the top.
With the SPX Top50 largely dominated by Tech stocks (34% of total market cap) and
with average longer-dated single stock vol in the basket trading close to 3yr lows (12M
SPX Top50 ATMf implied vol is in its 2 nd %-ile since Jun-14, Chart 16), we recommend
investors go long 12M SPX Top50 dispersion. Chart 18 shows that such a strategy
would have recorded its best performance during the formation and subsequent
bursting of the dotcom bubble as volatility increased in tandem with falling correlation
(see Chart 11).
Importantly, while implied correlation continues trading in a new, lower range since the
US election, the spread to realized correlation has remained healthy with the SPX Top50
12M implied vs. 6M realized correlation spread in its 81 st %-ile over the past 3 years
(Chart 17). This makes selling the correlation premium (inherently embedded in long
dispersion strategies) attractive vs. history.
Chart 16: Average SPX Top50 single stock 12M ATMf implied vol is
depressed vs. history, in part driven by Tech market cap dominating the
index and Tech vol the 2 nd lowest across sectors on a historical basis

Notable trends and dislocations (US)
Major US equity indices soar to all-time highs as the low vol regime persists
Friday marked the end of the second full week following the political turmoil on Wed,
17-May. Since then, volatility has once again collapsed (10d realized is at 4.6%) and the
S&P 500 term structure of volatility has steepened with the 3m-1m spread trading in
the 90 th 2y %-ile. Low S&P 500 short-dated vols pushed down the back end of the curve
(1y and beyond), while Russell 2000 1y+ vols remained bid (Chart 19). Last week, the VIX
printed 2 of its 15 closes below 10 since 1990 (Chart 20). Vol-of-vol remained
supported with the VVIX/VIX ratio setting yet another record (8.58) on Friday. All of this
happened as SPX, NDX and INDU finished the week at all-time highs.

ensuing volatility spike on 17-May, long-term vols (1y and above) reset
lower for SPX but remained bid for RTY

The political turmoil on 17-May caused short-term vols to reset
higher and the VIX jumped to 15.59 from 10.65 the prior day.
Short-term vols in turn moved the back end of the curve higher
with e.g. SPX (RTY) 1y vols trading higher by 1.05% (0.79%).
However, the agitation in equity markets was short-lived. The
front end of the curve collapsed over the subsequent trading
sessions and resulted in a very steep term structure for both
indices, similar to what we have become accustomed to over
the prior months.
By the end of last week, SPX long term vols (1y and beyond) had
moved to virtually the same levels where they traded prior to
the vol spike. RTY long-term vols, however, remain bid.
Chart 20: 2017 is already the 5 th calmest year for the VIX with 76 YTD
closes below 12. Despite the short-lived vol spike on 17-May, the VIX
had a very calm month of May, extending into June as it printed 6 out of
its 15 historic closes below 10

With only five months of the year behind us, the VIX has already
closed below 12 on 76 days. Since 1990, only 4 other years
have seen a larger number of trading sessions with the VIX
closing below 12.
Of the 15 trading sessions in VIX’s history since 1990 when the
index closed below 10, 6 were between May-17 and Jun-17. The
low short-dated implied vol is in part driven by realized vol; 10d
is at 4.5%, which is already subdued even for the current lowvol
regime (17th %-ile since the US election last November).
Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 9
Rates vol is near all-time lows and is favorable for positioning for a break-out
Since the US Election last November, the 10y US Treasury rate has fluctuated between
2.17% and 2.63%, constantly being jostled up or down by various economic forces. It is
currently trading towards the bottom of that range. Our rates strategists have a yearend
target of 2.85% for the 10y rate (just above the median forecast).
Long-term rates have remained low due to uncertainty around Fiscal policy (Trump’s
plans on infrastructure spending), subdued inflation expectations and a slower than
expected Fed hiking cycle. On the other hand, a near full-employment economy, hopes
for infrastructure spending, potential for higher inflation driven by energy prices &
increased government spending and an accelerated hiking cycle are providing a floor for
long-term rates. In the end, uncertainty remains and analysts’ estimates for the yearend
target vary widely between 1.6% and 3.7% (based on 59 forecasts with median and
mean of 2.8%).
For investors who believe that long-term rates will break out of their range we
recommend going long TLT 6m 35-delta strangles. The structure has rarely been
cheaper in history (Chart 22) and at present TLT 6m implied vol is 94bps below 6m
realized, with the spread at its lowest since Aug-15. A 3m version of the 35-delta
strangle prices just as attractively versus its history.
Chart 21: Rates volatility, as measured by the Merrill Option Volatility
Estimate index (MOVE) and by TLT (20+ year bond ETF) 3m ATMf vols,
are the lowest they have been all year and are very near the all-time

The UK general election is scheduled to take place on Thu, 8-
Jun-17. When the election was called on 18-April, the polls
pointed to a landslide victory for the Conservative Party. This
boosted the UK’s currency as investors assumed that such an
outcome would lead to a “smoother” Brexit. Indeed, on that day
the Sterling (GBPUSD) recorded its third best daily performance
over the past 8 years.
However, while official polls still suggest an outright majority
for the Conservative Party, the odds of a hung parliament have
increased in recent weeks. As a consequence the boost in the
currency after the election was called has slightly faded. With
significant further downside room to its recent pre-rally lows
and FX markets complacent with prevailing opinion poll data,
there clearly could be a significant near-term correction in the
sterling if the probability of a hung parliament becomes reality.
Hence we favor hedging downside risk in sterling via cheap FXB
put spreads to lever steep put skew (3m 95%-ATMf implied vol
spread at its 1-yr 90 th %-ile).

Volatility in Europe
Notable trends and dislocations (Europe)
European equities were mostly flat over the week with the notable exception of the DAX
which rallied 1.8% led by Bayer (which accounts for almost 10% of the index). In
contrast, the Russian RDXUSD dropped by 3.3% as oil prices continued to decline.
Short-dated (3M) implied vols dropped to 2y lows on the ESTX50, DAX and CAC which
helped push 12M-3M volatility term-structures to 2y highs on all three indices.
• The short 1xAug / long 2x Sep / short 1x Oct V2X futures fly jumped to 3.7v
on 31-May given speculation around early Italian elections. This is higher than
equivalent V2X flies at the same number of days to both the UK referendum and
the French elections. The current price is higher than 94% of the values of
historical flies 1d before the expiry of the earliest leg, suggesting it has ample
room to trade lower should political uncertainty abate by Aug.
• SX5E 2Y var convexity (var strike vs ATMf vol) has been driven lower by (A)
a decline in the Tail liquidity Risk Premium and (B) volatility skew becoming
more linear (i.e., less convex in strike)
• GBPUSD short-dated (1wk) implied has reached its 92nd 4yr percentile ahead of
the UK snap election on 8-Jun. It is however still at least 2.7v below the levels
witnessed ahead of previous well known political catalysts.
• DTE GY has run too fast, too quick: hedge a potential reversal using a Sep17
collar (+17put/-18 call) for 46bps to hedge losses greater than 2.9% while
retaining upside to 18 (near 15yr high of 18.05) by the Sep expiry
• Equity vs credit: Enel stock attractive vs CDS given cheap bullish risky &
high div yield vs CDS: Among 50 companies which have high dividend yields
relative to bond yields (as highlighted by BofAML credit and equity strategists),
we note that Enel’s projected 12m div yield is higher than its CDS and the price
of 3M bullish risk reversals are cheap (vs other names and vs a 5-year history).
ESTX50 Sep/Oct fwd vol rose as early Italian elections are (slightly) more likely
According to our economists, the agreement reached between major Italian parties on a
German-style proportional electoral law has made early elections more likely. They note
that the Italian press cite possible early election dates between 10-Sep and 22-Oct, i.e.,
almost entirely within the V2X Sep future’s volatility bucket (which also encompasses
German elections). This may in part be why the short 1xAug / long 2x Sep / short 1x Oct
V2X futures fly jumped to 3.7v on 31-May, which is higher than equivalent flies ahead of
both the UK referendum and recently concluded French elections (Chart 24). However,
our economists view an early vote within September as technically difficult.

developments in Italy or Germany increasing risk perception),
the fly would stand to gain considerably.

We recently noted that ESTX50 long-dated (2Y) variance
convexity (var strike vs. ATMf vol) had declined considerably in
recent months. This has been driven by (A) a decline in the Tail
liquidity Risk Premium (as defined in our piece More to variance
swaps than meets the eye) and (B) volatility skew becoming
more linear (i.e., 80-90 skew being similar to 90-100 skew).
Both these components of variance convexity suggest that
long-dated ESTX50 tails (e.g., VarSwaps or far OTM puts) are
historically cheap vs. ATMf vol.

Deutsche Tel has run too fast too quickly; hedge using a Sep17 +17P/-18C collar
BofAML equity telecom analysts have reiterated their recommendation to be cautious
on Deutsche Tel as the company may face regulatory hurdles in their T-Mobile merger.
Given the stock has outperformed European telcos (SXKP) by 15.1% over the past 1
year, investors who own the stock should consider hedging downside with a long DTE
GY Sep17 17 put, short DTE GY Sep17 18 call for 0.46%, in our view. Indeed, spending
0.46% to protect gains is attractive as the price of the structure has rarely been cheaper
(only 14% of the time since Jun-08, Chart 29). Moreover, Chart 30 illustrates that this
structure enables stock owners to protect from losses greater than 2.1% while retaining
3.6% upside potential if the stock rises to 18 (near its 15-year high) by the Sep expiry.

Enel stock attractive vs credit given cheap bullish risky & high div yield vs CDS
On 31-May-17, we recommended buying SX5E bullish risk reversals and selling IBOXX
HY TRS as a low carry / low risk trade with gearing to improving earnings and FCF. We
now look for similar opportunities at the single name level. Among the 50 companies
which have high projected 12m dividend yield relative to bond yields (as highlighted by
BofAML credit and equity strategists – Chart 9), we highlight a subset (15 names) where
we have option data since at least Jun-12 (last 5yrs). The names in the bottom-right
corner of Chart 31 indicate the cheapest 3m -25d put/+25delta call risk-reversals where
projected dividend yield is highest relative to the CDS spread. We note that:
• Royal Dutch Shell’s stock yield is attractive vs CDS: Shell’s projected 12m div
yield is 7.5% while its CDS is 52bps (0.5%), resulting in a div yield-CDS spread of
7.0%, the highest in our screen; this suggests value in Shell equity vs credit.
• Cheap bullish risk reversals in Enel and Iberdrola: 3m -25delta put/+25delta call
risk reversals in Enel and Iberdrola are the lowest across the 15 names in Chart 31.
Notably, bullish risk reversals in Enel are also particularly cheap versus history as
the price of 3m -95%f / +105%f bullish risk reversals is below its 5 th 5-y %-ile.

SX5E Dec18 div futures are high relative to Dec17 and BofAML div forecasts
SX5E Dec18 dividend futures are trading at €122.4 (6.8% higher than Dec17 dividend
futures), which is unusually high relative to history. Indeed, Chart 34 highlights that the
second DED future (currently Dec18) is at its highest level in 8 years relative to the first
(currently Dec17). Moreover, Dec18 div futures are trading only 1.5% below BofAML
fundamental bottom-up forecasts of 124.2 for 2018, suggesting low upside potential if
BofAML forecasts materialise (Chart 35).

Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 17
Volatility in Asia
Use best-of puts to cheaply hedge a reversal in the rally
BofAML global strategists note that the massive central bank liquidity supernova has
allowed the Wall Street bull to flare higher, led by uber "growth" (EM internet stock
returns annualizing 125%). In light of this, we feel that it is prudent that investors
protect gains as we think today’s low volatility environment remains highly fragile,
characterized by the below stats:
• The MSCI Asia Pac index is up for the 5 th consecutive month and is trading at multiyear
highs, while equity foreign inflows year-to-date are at the highest since 2004.
• Option delta-adjusted open interest for KOSPI2 and HSI are near a 4-year highs.
• The BofAML global Risk-Love investor sentiment measure is in euphoria, and
China’s nominal GDP is likely peaking. The Asian/EM EPS upgrade cycle is likely
rolling over.
Volatility of equity indices remains at post-GFC lows while markets continue to trend
higher. If the market were to realize a correction, we believe that indices would be
highly correlated, and hence we recommend buying a 14-Sep-2017 95% strike best-of
put on NKY/KOSPI2/HSI that costs 0.8%, a 45% discount to average vanilla puts.

Notable trends and dislocations (Asia)
Asian equity markets saw modest gains last week, led by Japan’s NKY index, which
increased 2.5% week-over-week. In fact, the index breached the 20,000 mark last Friday
for the first time since December 2015. Gains were driven by foreign inflows from
investors attracted to very strong corporate profits. Additionally, economic data from
last week indicated that Japan’s unemployment rate held at a two-decade low, and
capital spending during Q1 beat analyst estimates. The biggest contributor to last
weeks’ return was Fast Retailing Co Ltd (9983 JT), which added 3.9% week-over-week.
The company reported that same-store-sales for its Uniqlo stores rose 2.4% year-overyear
in May due to successful strategies during the Golden Week and Mother’s Day
holidays. After the NKY, last week’s second biggest gainer was Hong Kong’s HSI, which
added 1.1%. The leading name in the index was Geely Automobile Holdings (175 HK),
which jumped 19.8% week-over-week in response to optimism over its recent
acquisition of a 49.9% stake in Proton Holdings. Hong Kong’s HSCEI saw a similar return
as the index added 0.8% last week.
Next we turn to India, where the NIFTY gained 0.6% last week. The leading name in the
index was Aurobindo Pharma (ARBP IS), which increased 11.4% week-over-week in
response to an investor presentation which outlined the company’s plans to increase
collaboration across its global customer business. Elsewhere in Asia, Korea’s KOSPI
increased 0.3% week-over-week, Australia’s ASX added 0.6%, and Taiwan’s TWSE
gained 0.5%.
Asian term structures were unchanged week-over-week at 3.8% on average
• Asian 3m ATM volatility increased on average 0.1 vol point to 12.6% last week,
while 10 day realized vol fell on average 0.8 vol points to 8.6%. Notably, NIFTY’s
implied vol increased 0.7 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the other
hand, the HSCEI’s 10d realized vol saw the largest drop in the region, falling 5.1 vol
points week-over-week to 9.2%.
• On average, term structures among Asian indices remained unchanged at 3.8% last
week. The KOSPI 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing 0.7 vol
points to 2.9%. On the other hand, India’s NIFTY saw the largest flattening as its
term structure flattened 0.5 vol point to 3.8%.
• Asian 3M 90-110% skews narrowed 0.2 vol points on average to 3.0%. Japan’s NKY
narrowed the most, decreasing 1.0 vol point to 5.0%.

Except for the ASX200, Asian stock and index vols are more
depressed than index correlation
Today’s ultra-low Asian index realized volatility is largely driven
by depressed single stock realized volatility and low realized
correlation. Stock and index volatilities are generally more
depressed than index correlation. For instance, the KOSPI2 3-
month realized correlation (0.13) is the highest relative to its
history (at its 22 nd percentile since 2008) as foreign inflows
have pushed the index to an all-time high and have driven
correlation up. Korean market activities used to be dominated
by domestic sector rotation trades.
On the other hand, ASX200 correlation is relatively depressed as
the correlation between the banks and materials sectors has
broken down in recent months.

US$3.6bn Korean auto-callable issuance in May-17, down 21% MoM
• Korean issuance fell 21% MoM to US$3.6bn in May-17, which is close to the
average monthly issuance of US$3.8bn since 2014. Products issued in Oct-16
(US$3.1bn) and Nov-2016 (US$3.4bn) have knocked out recently and rolled into
new products. However, the legacy HSCEI-linked products issued in May-15 were
struck at a very high HSCEI spot level and were not able to knock-out this month.
We think issuance may pick up in July and August as ~US$4.0bn of legacy products
may knock-out in Jul-17 with an average HSCEI knock-out level of 9665 (Chart 43).
• Issuance in KOSPI2-linked products (up from US$840mn to US$846mn) remained
steady in May-17; HSI-linked products fell 66% from US$360mn to US$120mn as
investors prefered HSCEI-linked products (which only fell from US$760mn to
US$700mn).
• SX5E-linked (US$1.0bn), KOSPI2-linked (US$846mn), HSCEI-linked (US$700mn),
and SPX-linked products (US$550mn) accounted for 86% of the May-17 issuance.
We estimate that structured product issuers are currently long US$10mn of KOSPI2
vega and US$89mn HSCEI vega respectively. The majority of the US$89mn HSCEI
outstanding vega came from the US$14bn of HSCEI-linked legacy products issued
between Apr-15 and Jul-15 that have not knocked-out.
20 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017
NKY Uridashi monthly issuance slightly picked-up in May-17
With NKY breaking above 19,500 in May and triggering some early knock-outs, Japanese
Uridashi issuance picked up towards the end of May to US$630mn. We estimate there
is now around US$7.9bn (vs. $8.1bn last month) in product outstanding and over 50% of
it will be knocked out if the NKY rallies above 20,500. We estimate issuers are currently
long US$44mn vega in NKY. The peak of the vega profile is around the 17,500 level and
we expect issuers to lose US$2mn of vega for every 1% rally in the NKY.
Chart 42: Korean auto-callable issuance fell 21% to US$3.6bn in May-17; Issuance in KOSPI2-linked products (rose from US$840mn to US$846mn) remained
steady; HSI-linked products fell 66% from US$360mn to US$120mn as investors prefered HSCEI-linked products (which only fell from US$760mn to
US$700mn)

95%
5-Dec-16 2.10% Jun-17 expiry
5-Dec-16 2.30% Jun-17 expiry
Equity-FX correlation is not priced for a spillover of populism into the EU, which could cause EUR
to fall against an already weakened GBP as equities fall
UKX is heavily exposed to EU (50% revenues) and should underperform SPX if GBP tailwind
fades. Volatility & correlation suit well for outperformance
Cheapen long XLF upside to near 8y lows via selling upside on structurally challenged European
banks & relatively more bearish outlook for US rates vs EU
Still depressed equity-bond correlation (US 5Y bonds vs. SPX in the 37th%-ile since Jun-88)
cheapens the cost of SPX puts conditioned on higher rates
Participate in the continuation of the reflation trade. Cheapen Financials upside by selling rich
Utilities and Staples vol & expensive correl.
Higher US rates and stronger dollar are likely to hurt companies exposed to EM and help US DM.
Trade the outperformance in a risk-controlled way, avoiding
selling the record-low correlation

Buy NKY Jun17-Jun18 18,500 strike FVA 02-Dec-16 21.5% Jun-17 expiry What if QE hits its limit? Long NKY vol outright which is cheap to carry
Long Russell 2000 vs. short S&P 500 Dec-18 var spread 5-Dec-16 3.9pts Dec-18 expiry
With fiscal stimulus and potential tax cuts, small caps revert to old normal generating higher vol
on upside and downside relative to large caps
Buy 1x Jun17 64 call on Aug17 Brent futures, sell 1x SXEP Jun17 330 call 9-Jan-17 1.00% Jun-17 expiry

Options Risk Statement
Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk
Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.
Investor suitability
The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks
involved with investing in listed options:

Price objective basis & risk
Deutsche Telekom (DTEGF / DTEGY, B-2-7, EUR17.42/US$19.45)
Our price objective for DT is EUR18.0/sh (US$19.62) and is derived from our Sum-ofthe-Parts
analysis.
Each business is valued via DCF (except MtM for TMUS and OTE ) using a 7.0% WACC
and 1.00% terminal growth rate for Domestic and Western Europe assets (and 8.0%
WACC/1% term growth for Eastern Europe assets) and cross-checked using implied
valuation multiple analysis.
Our Domestic business valuation reflects DT's solid positioning in both fixed (FTTC
rollout) and mobile (superior network quality, integrated business model).
Upside risks to our PO are any asset sales (US, non-integrated assets in Austria or NL)
and revenue upside from T-Home's TV push.
Downside risks to our PO are higher than expected mobile impact coming from new
Drillisch tariffs or failure to turnaround good US operational trends into more profitable
revenue streams.

* Issuers that were investment banking clients of BofA Merrill Lynch or one of its affiliates within the past 12 months. For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A
stock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.
