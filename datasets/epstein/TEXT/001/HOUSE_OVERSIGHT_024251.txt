Top 10 Media Stocks for 2015 
By Dan Moskowitz March 19, 2015 AAA 
Oat' 
The following list is broken down into Top-Tier Media Stocks and Speculative Media Stocks. It might surprise 
you that some of the names on the latter list aren't on the former list, but there is a simple reason for this, which 
will be revealed below. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024252 
Top-Tier Media Stocks 
Walt Disney 
The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is one of the strongest brands in the world. It also possesses multiple revenue 
streams and pricing power. Q1 EPS jumped 23% year over year based on record revenue. When a company 
delivers record revenue, that trend doesn't make a sudden U-turn. If there's going to be a turnaround for the 
worse, it will take time to play out, giving you time to exit your position. (For related reading, see: This 
Company Is No Mickey Mouse Operation.) 
CBS 
CBS Corp.'s (CBS) Q4 revenue increased 3% and diluted EPS improved 8%. CBS also announced a $1 billion 
share buyback in the first quarter. This will significantly reduce the share count, which should improve 
earnings. CBS will once again have Thursday Night Football, and it will be the home of Super Bowl 50. It's 
also home to regular-season NFL games, March Madness and The Masters. However, its reach goes well 
beyond sports. 
Comcast 
FY2014 revenue at Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) increased 6.4%. Operating cash flow and EPS improved 6.9% 
and 25%, respectively. Comcast also increased its dividend 11% and announced that $4.25 billion of its $10 
billion share buyback program would take place in 2015. (For more, see: This Company is as Unavoidable as it 
is Unloved.) 
Twenty-First Century Fox 
Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s (FOXA) Q2 operating income before depreciation and amortization increased 
12%. Fox studios enjoyed 24 Academy Award nominations in 2015, making it the industry leader. Twenty-First 
Century Fox also recently created the Europe's leading pay TV business. 
Google 
Google Inc. (GOOGL) is known as more of a technology company than a media company, but its YouTube 
segment consumes approximately 15% of all broadband traffic in the United States and Canada (only Netflix, 
Inc. (NFLX) is higher at 35%). Google also makes this list because of its $62.63 billion in cash, which means it 
can enter any business it pleases. If it chooses to expand its media presence, then it would likely steal share 
from some of the current industry leaders. (For related reading, see: How Google's Self-Driving Car Will 
Change Everything.) 
Speculative Media Stocks 
Charter Communications 
Q4 revenue jumped 9.9% at Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR) thanks to higher customer penetration on 
Internet, video, and commercial businesses. Another positive is that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) recently 
increased its position in CHTR by adding 1.2 million shares. CHTR now represents 1.35% of the fund's 
portfolio. The reason CHTR is on the speculative list is a lack of profitability. 
Discovery Communications 
Differentiation is the key here thanks to Discovery Communications, Inc.'s (DISCA) success with docudramas. 
In FY2014, revenue increased 13%, adjusted earnings per diluted share improved 13%, free cash flow increased 
2%, and $1.4 billion worth of stock was repurchased. The biggest risks here are a challenging U.S. market and 
currency headwinds. It should also be pointed out that there is an 11% short position on the stock. (For related 
reading, see: A Breakdown of Stock Buybacks.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024253 
Viacom 
MTV, VH1, CMT, BET, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr, Comedy Central, TV Land, SPIKE, and more. Do these sound 
like brands that are likely to suffer? No. Viacom, Inc. (VIA) is a profitable company that pays a small dividend. 
On the other hand, a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.88 isn't comforting. 
Time Warner 
Time Warner Inc. (TWX) has 165 channels across 200 countries. This includes HBO. In FY2014, revenue 
increased 3%. That's not spectacular, but adjusted EPS jumped 18%, which now represents six consecutive 
years of adjusted EPS growth in the high teens. Time Warner also returned $6.6 billion to shareholders via 
dividends and buybacks throughout the year. Over the long haul, cable companies will have a difficult time 
competing against streaming services, but all is okay for right now. 
Scripps Networks Interactive 
Among Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.'s (SNI) properties are Home and Garden Television, Food Network, 
Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel and Great American Country. These are strong brands. Strong 
enough that Scripps Networks expects FY2015 revenue to increase approximately 4%. The company also 
expects selling, general, and administrative expenses to come in between flat and down 2%. Either way, it's a 
positive when revenue is outpacing SG&A expenses. Furthermore, Scripps Networks has announced that it's 
adding $1 billion to its share buyback program and increasing its dividend by 15%. The risk here is the stock's 
sensitivity to broader market corrections. (For a look back to 2009, see: Scripps Network Interactive Worth a  
Look.) 
Performance Comparisons 
Another reason why some stocks made the top list and others did not is performance. If a stock can't appreciate 
in a bull market, then how would you expect it to perform when the trend reverses? Capital preservation should 
be the number one priority for a savvy investor. Below are total return numbers for each company as of 
3/18/2015). 
1-Year 	3-Year 	5-Year 	10-Year 
DIS 	33.09% 	36.87% 	27.03% 	15.19% 
CBS 	-3.95% 	26.94% 	23.19% 	12.56% 
CMCSA 	19.26% 	27.62% 	23.13% 	13.40% 
FOXA 	6.46% 	26.99% 	24.13% 	8.83% 
GOOGL 	-6.61% 	21.87% 	14.84% 	20.18% 
CHTR 	50.27% 	143.56% 	140.36% 	n/a 
DISCA 	-25.98% 	8.93% 	13.74% 	n/a 
VIA 	-20.33% 	11.19% 	17.28% 	n/a 
TWX 	37.35% 	38.08% 	25.34% 	9.86% 
SNI 	10.10% 	15.26% 	12.24% 	n/a 
The Bottom Line 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024254 
The Top-Tier Media Stocks have outperformed Speculative Media Stocks over the past three years (for the most 
part). Therefore, you should strongly consider the first set of stocks listed above. While it's entirely possible 
they all underperform in 2015 if the market falters, these are elite names that are highly likely to be around for a 
long time. Even if the worst occurs, you will have an opportunity to add more to your position at cheaper prices.
