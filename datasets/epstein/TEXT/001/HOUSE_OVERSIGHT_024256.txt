Mon-Fri 
10:30am-noon; 12:45pm-2pm 
Milstein West AB 
Syllabus 
I. Course Description 
This course offers a rigorous introduction to the field of cyberlaw. We will investigate the 
evolving nature of online architecture and activities, and the ways in which law has been, and 
will be, leveraged to influence them. 
Course themes include the complex interaction between Internet governance organizations and 
sovereign states, the search for balance between the ease of disseminating information online 
and the interest of copyright holders, privacy advocates, and others in controlling that 
dissemination, and the roles of intermediaries and platforms in shaping what people can and 
cannot do online. The course will include an array of learning and teaching methods. Students 
will be expected to participate in a variety of activities. 
II. Class Schedule

Reading Assignments 
Day 1: Introduction 
Welcome! We aspire to the implausible: a nine-day introduction to the unusual dynamics of the 
world's digital space, sufficient for a strategic understanding of what makes it difficult (but far 
from impossible) to regulate or shape; who's trying to do it nonetheless; and how such efforts 
have fared over the past twenty years, with an eye towards lessons for influencing the space 
and the behavior within it today. 
In addition to offering some frameworks for thinking about Internet architecture and policy, and 
the curious open and generative nature of the phenomenon, we will delve into the net as a 
contingently global phenomenon, and the way that complicates regulation by traditional 
sovereigns. Our case study will be the current debates around implementation of Europe's "right 
to be forgotten" in search engine results. As you complete the readings, you might see how 
you'd answer the question of what a state like France's view should be towards the scope of its 
RTBF regulation, and whether the kind of "zoning" described in the Cato Institute article from 
thirteen years ago (!), is realizable and desirable.

Day 2: Copyright 
Copyright was once thought of as the defining battle of consumer networking. Academic 
technologies brought into the mainstream made it trivial to prepare and distribute perfect copies 
of copyrighted work without permission -- and the comparatively powerful organizations 
representing copyright holders saw this as an existential threat. 
We will read some of the "grim joy" experienced by Internet freedom types in dancing on the 
grave of copyright in the mid-1990s -- and immerse in some of the law and policy changes 
effected in the United States to deal with the problem without running up against the equities of 
rapidly-growing intermediaries of online and Internet service providers (turns out, there's a 
difference). 
The copyright wars revealed a variety of strategies that we'll look at with the benefit of years of 
hindsight, including lawsuits against network providers, software makers, and individual users 
both sending and receiving files, as well as technical changes designed to make it more difficult 
to share items that wish not to be shared. Ultimately we are drawn to the question of whether 
the wars were won by one side or another, or whether it's more accurate to say that they simply 
faded away. What issues today feel make-or-break, yet could simply fade rather than be 
resolved, and why? 
We'll end the day with a peek into, and practice of, a current intense if obscure debate: that of 
whether digital rights management hooks should be placed into standards for Web browsers.

Day 3: Cryptocurrency 
One view of the progression of digital technology has been roughly from amateur to 
professional, from open to closed, and from chaotic to ordered -- as the early successes from 
left field of Google, Facebook, and Twitter enter publicly-traded adulthood. At the ripe year of 
2017, are there still digital disruptions to be had? 
The phenomenon (and increasing literal value) of cryptocurrency -- and, for that matter, the 
foundational blockchain technologies on which it can be based -- seems to indicate that there 
are still surprises from left field. What does the rise of cryptocurrency tell us about the state of 
cyberspace, and what should we expect -- and hope for -- next?

Day 4: Private Infrastructures for Government Surveillance 
Digital privacy has at times been understood as privacy against corporate intrusion (think ad 
networks); against government (think the various government intelligence-gathering 
establishments around the world); and against one another (think drones as well as more 
pedestrian technologies that empower people to document facts about, or even doxx, each 
other). 
This session will look at the second form of surveillance, especially as effectuated through the 
cooperation or compulsion of private intermediaries. How successful is such surveillance, and 
will it continue to be effective as the public reacts by potentially adopting privacy-enhancing 
tools? How successful do we want it to be, and how might frameworks agreeable within 
jurisdictions that embrace the rule of law be used or abused within those that do not?

Day 5: Internet Architecture/Net Neutrality 
We increasingly assume the availability of commodity networking -- a flat fee for access -- even 
as the way in which we experience the Internet is evolving through a curious microeconomics, a 
mishmash of policies designed to subsidize or regulate access, and a sometime ability to 
arbitrage around arrangements through technologies to facilitate access sharing and virtual 
tunneling. 
How is Internet access likely to evolve, and what choices exist for polities with particular ideals 
about how it should work? 
Discussion will include Andy Ellis, Berkman Klein Center Fellow and CSO of Akamai, one of the 
most important companies that people haven't heard of.

Day 6: Weaponized Social 
The time when the solution to bad speech could be advanced as simply more speech might 
seem quaint. The famously libertarian Electronic Frontier Foundation recently released a white 
paper in which it acknowledged a line between a clash of ideas and flat-out harassment, with 
the latter causing less rather than more robust debate. Separately, concerns about outright 
false news that spreads virally have inspired calls for action by intermediaries like Facebook -- a 
self-described technology, rather than media, company. 
Applying lessons from the conflicts of the past two decades online, how might we agree upon a 
vision for social networking even if we disagree on many substantive issues to be debated 
there, and what are the roles, if any, of regulators and private platforms in establishing 
boundaries on behavior online through code or legal sanction? 
Is it more difficult to agree on a vision is our media is no longer about the battlefield or the real 
world but is the battlefield and the real world?

Day 7: Free vs. Proprietary Code and Content 
This day examines quite different models for the development and distribution of software --
which can also serve as models for hardware, and for content. What kind of ecosystem, 
featuring what models, is desirable? 
We will think about current issues in cybersecurity as a case study in why free vs. proprietary 
code might matter, and take up the question of how regulation might be applied when there are 
no easily identified intermediaries in the production of code. 
And we will hear from the legendary David Clark, one of the framers of the Internet.

Day 8: Governance 
The tensions between free vs. proprietary software help focus us on foundational questions of 
governance that are threaded through the course. To what extent should new technologies be 
shaped and shared by anyone without gatekeeping? 2017 may find the Internet in middle age. 
Do its puzzles suggest anything about whether and how to resolve governance questions for 
more newly mainstreamed technologies like machine learning and other Al? 
In addition to the challenges that the Internet has provided in regulation and governance, the 
inability to really understand what many "learned" algorithms do, and their ability to have 
properties and abilities beyond the capabilities of their initial designers, presents additional 
challenges when thinking about whether and how to regulate the research, as well as the 
deployment, of Al. Phenomena like digital currencies and distributed Al systems reprises the 
ideas and challenges of Barlow's declaration of independence of cyberspace.
