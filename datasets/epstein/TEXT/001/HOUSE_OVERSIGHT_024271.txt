“Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to create something that is
not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.”

the world.”
Al Gore

David Marcus (former CEO PayPal)
“I really like Bitcoin. I own Bitcoins. It’s a store of value, a distributed ledger. It’s a great place to
put assets."

ChangeTip enables a “tipping” feature using Bitcoin on other companies’ websites. It
has built a Bitcoin micropayment platform that is currently integrated with Twitter,
GitHub, Reddit, Google+, Tumblr, and YouTube.
We believe that ChangeTip’s micro transaction platform is poised to be the financial
equivalent of the “Like” button, and enabling new mechanisms for premium online
constant to be monetized.
