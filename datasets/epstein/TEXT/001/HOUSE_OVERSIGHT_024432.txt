KUE Management Inc. 
Knowledge Universe Education L.P. ("KUE," and, together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") is a 
Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. KUE Management Inc. is a Cayman Islands exempted 
company and the sole general partner of KUE (the "General Partner"). KUE is the indirect controlling 
stockholder of Knowledge Learning Corporation ("KLC"), the largest for-profit early childhood care and 
education company in the U.S., which operates approximately 2,500 locations in 39 states. 
We are offering investment units (the "Units"), each comprised of one Common limited partner unit 
("Common LP Unit") in KUE and one Class A ordinary share of the General Partner ("Class A Share"), for 
$1,000 per Unit. We are offering the Units on a strictly confidential basis pursuant to a private placement 
with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Credit Suisse acting as placement agents (the "Agents"), subject to 
various conditions, exclusively to accredited investors. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale 
of the Units to expand operations, including through strategic acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally, 
to develop new products and services, to repay certain existing indebtedness and for other corporate 
purposes. We reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify the offer and to reject orders in whole or in 
part. The offering is expected to be completed in one or more closings on or prior to March 31, 2007. 
The Units and the underlying Common LP Units and Class A Shares have not been, nor will they 
be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or 
qualified under any applicable U.S. state statutes or laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction. The Units 
will be offered and sold under the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the 
Securities Act and Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act, and 
other similar exemptions available pursuant to the laws of the states and other jurisdictions where 
the offering will be made. 
There is no public market for the Units and no such market is expected to develop in the future. There is 
no obligation on the part of any person to register the Units or the underlying Common LP Units or Class 
A Shares under the Securities Act or any state or non-U.S. securities laws other than in the limited 
circumstances described in this Private Placement Memorandum. 
Investing in the Units involves risks. You should read the section entitled "Risk Factors" 
beginning on page 44 for a discussion of certain risk factors that you should consider before 
investing in the Units.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR (including pro forma presentations thereof) and the 
related ratios presented in this Memorandum are supplemental measures of our performance that are not 
required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. 
("GAAP"). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR are not measurements of our financial 
performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income 
or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow 
from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation (including 
impairment charges) and amortization. Pro forma presentations of EBITDA have also added back 
KinderCare Learning Centers, Inc.'s ("KinderCare") discontinued operations, consistent with KLC's 
treatment of center closures and sales and KinderCare's historical presentation of EBITDA. Adjusted 
EBITDA represents EBITDA plus (i) expenses (minus gains) that we do not consider reflective of our 
ongoing operations after the KinderCare acquisition, as further described in this Memorandum and (ii) 
management fees which are subordinated to our obligations on our 7%% senior subordinated notes (the 
"Notes") and which are added back in measuring our performance for purposes of our ability to incur debt 
under our indenture. Our actual and projected Adjusted EBITDA, where applicable, also exclude non-
cash stock-based compensation expense, which is also excluded under our indenture; accruals under our 
stock appreciation rights ("SAR") plan; and accruals under our long term incentive plan, which are non-
cash at the time of award and vest and become payable in three years subject to continued employment 
(with certain exceptions). Our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for 2005 excludes restructuring and integration 
charges associated with the KinderCare acquisition and the cost of operating parallel organizations during 
the integration process, which management does not consider reflective of ongoing operations. Adjusted 
EBITDAR is Adjusted EBITDA plus rent expense. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted 
EBITDAR because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and 
believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the 
evaluation of issuers, many of which present EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDAR 
when reporting their results. 
We are basing our executive incentive compensation payments in part on our performance measured 
using Adjusted EBITDA including adjustments described herein. We also use financial measures similar 
to Adjusted EBITDA, though subject to certain different adjustments, in the senior credit facility that we 
entered into in connection with the KinderCare acquisition and the indenture governing the Notes to 
measure our compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. Measures 
similar to Adjusted EBITDA are also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price 
potential acquisition candidates. For example, we evaluated the KinderCare acquisition and our 2003 
acquisition of ARAMARK Educational Resources to a significant degree based on their historical and 
potential EBITDA, as adjusted for items we did not consider representative of post-acquisition operations. 
We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to 
period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital 
structures (affecting relative interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies 
of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities 
and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We believe Adjusted EBITDAR is a useful 
measure of performance independent of occupancy costs. 
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting EBITDA to eliminate the impact of a number of items we do 
not consider indicative of our ongoing operations and for the other reasons noted above. For the reasons 
indicated herein, you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider it 
appropriate. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR, you should be aware 
that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should 
not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring 
items. 
15 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should 
not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
Some of these limitations are: 
• they do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
• they do not reflect the cost of our non-cash stock-based compensation or our SAR plan or long term 
incentive plan or the expense associated with allocating Profits Participation LP Units (as defined 
below) to employees; 
• they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; 
• they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service 
interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
• they do not reflect management fees; 
• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and 
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and our non-GAAP measures do not reflect cash 
requirements for such replacements or the related expense; 
• they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from the significant costs we have 
incurred in integrating KinderCare, and we are likely to incur significant integration costs in future 
acquisitions; 
• other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently 
than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure; and 
• they do not comply with the requirements of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR should not be 
considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or 
reduce our indebtedness. We compensate for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results as well as 
these non-GAAP measures. 
For more information, see our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements 
included elsewhere in this Memorandum.

interests therein, which is a principal component of our growth strategy;

accordance with our plans;

able to protect our interests adequately in respect of such investments; 
• we or our subsidiaries may be unable to raise additional financing which may be needed to satisfy 
certain of our subsidiaries' working capital requirements; 
• failure to comply with present or future applicable U.S. or foreign governmental regulation and 
licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations; 
• activities of Knowledge Universe Learning Group LLC C'KULG), the parent entity of the General 
Partner and/or its Principals may be competitive with the Company; conflicts of interest may arise with 
the Principals and their affiliates; the Company may not engage in certain businesses; 
• litigation and adverse publicity concerning incidents at child care centers could hurt our reputation; 
• our insurance policies may prove inadequate to cover claims, and we may be unable to maintain our 
existing coverage in the future at reasonable prices; 
• factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions, could affect demand for our child care 
services; 
17

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this 
Memorandum. You should carefully consider the information set forth under "Risk Factors". The term "KUE" refers 
only to Knowledge Universe Education L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The terms "Knowledge 
Universe Education", the "Company", "we", "us" and "our" refer to KUE and, where applicable, its subsidiaries, and 
do not refer to the Agents. In November 2005, KLC separated its education operations ("KLC OpCo') from its real 
estate assets ("KLC PropCo'). 
1.1. Company Overview 
KUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world and the largest for-profit education 
company in the pre-school to 12th grade segment ("pre-K-12") in the world. While the Company's 
operations are currently based within the U.S., the proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to 
expand KUE's education platform both globally and across the pre-K-12 education continuum. KUE's 
existing portfolio of assets consists of: 
(i) 
KLC OpCo, the leading early childhood education 
("ECE") company with 2,507 locations in 39 states 
and the District of Columbia and nearly two and a 
half times larger than its next closest competitor in 
terms of revenue; 
(ii) KLC PropCo, one of the largest education based 
real estate portfolios in the U.S. consisting of 845 
early childhood centers located in 37 states; and 
Knowledge Universe 
Education LP 
87.6%1 
KUE Management Inc. 
(General Partner) 
17.9% to 40.0%2 
Knowledge Learning 
Corporation (KLC) 
k12 Inc. 
(iii) A significant interest in k12, an online curriculum 
provider and kindergarten through 12th grade management company, currently serving over 
25,000 students as the largest operator of online virtual schools in the U.S. 
The principal owners of KUE are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the 
"Principals"). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the 
education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. Steven Green, 
former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an international 
industrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, housing, consumer 
products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Company represents the Principals' sole vehicle for 
equity investment opportunities in the pre-K-12 sector going forward. 
The Principals founded the Company and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their 
vision of a world where competition for human capital3 is becoming the driving force of economic 
prosperity. To remain competitive in the world economy, countries will be forced to invest heavily in the 
development of their human capital. The Principals believe that an investment made in an individual's 
education, especially at a young age, is the most effective way to build human capital and thereby 
increase that individual's lifelong productivity. As the largest for-profit provider of ECE in the world, the 
Company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends. 
:The 12.4% minority position is held by various investors. 
KUE's ownership varies depending on the liquidation value or sale value of k12 and according to the preference of the various securities KUE owns. 
At higher valuations, KUE's percentage ownership is lower. See "k12 Inc. (k12) — k12 Equity." 
3 The economic theory of Human Capital Policy was first published by University of Chicago professor James Heckman in Human Capital Policy, dated 
August 2002.

Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross 
national income of $48 trillion.4 In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1 trillion market.' Education 
is still predominantly provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE 
believes that the industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the 
evolution observed in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and 
telecommunications. 
The Company's strategy is to grow its existing platforms both domestically and internationally and to 
expand its assets globally across the pre-K-12 education continuum. In addition to its current investments 
in ECE and online curriculum, KUE will seek to expand by acquiring education companies offering 
services or products that can complement its current offering. KUE believes that owning a diversified 
portfolio of assets in the pre-K-12 education space will allow it to leverage content and best practices 
across multiple constituencies and to multiple markets. KUE's strategy in U.S. ECE is to expand its 
existing platform through the opening of new centers, opportunistic acquisitions of smaller competitors 
and the sale of education-related products and services through existing channels. Internationally, KUE 
has identified several near-term opportunities to expand into Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, with some 
of these opportunities in advanced stages of preparation. 
Management has a history of successfully growing through acquisitions. In May 2003, KLC acquired 
Aramark Educational Resources ("AER"), a company three times its size in terms of revenue. 
Management completed the integration of AER in approximately 12 months, realizing approximately $10 
million in net annual synergies and improving operational performance. In January 2005, the Company 
acquired KinderCare, the largest provider of ECE services in the U.S. at the time. Management achieved 
approximately $25 million in net annualized synergies through the closing of under-performing centers 
and the rationalization of corporate overhead. In November 2005, KLC separated its education 
operations (KLC OpCo) from its real estate assets (KLC PropCo). Management believes this division 
allows KLC OpCo management to focus on the core business of operating and growing the ECE 
business while the maximization of the valuable educational real estate portfolio is managed and 
expanded by a professional real estate firm, Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly Greenstreet 
Realty Partners, L.P.), and also represents management's view of KLC's component businesses. 
Management believes that KUE presents an attractive financial profile with its combination of businesses: 
(i) KLC OpCo, which generated $1.48 billion in pro forma revenue and $150 million in pro forma Adjusted 
EBITDA6 in 2005, is projected to grow organically to $2.3 billion and $320 million by 2011, respectively 
and to generate operating cash flow growing from $72 million in 2005 to $214 million in 2011; (ii) a real 
estate portfolio in KLC PropCo that generated an additional $88 million in pro forma EBITDA in 2005; and 
(Hi) an investment in k12, which continues to deliver top line growth in excess of 25% and has seen its 
revenue grow at a 133% compounded annual growth rate over the last three fiscal years (from $6.7 
million in 2002 to $85.1 million in 2005).

Education is one of the largest sectors in the world and represents a large portion of a country's 
investments 
— Represents approximately 5% of global gross national income of $48 trillion. In the U.S. alone, 
education represents a $1 trillion market with for-profit education accounting for approximately $81 
billion or 7.8% of the overall market. 
— The pre-K-12 segment of the education market is approximately a $610 billion market, with for-
profit pre-K-12 education accounting for approximately $37.4 billion, over 6.1% of the pre-K-12 
market/ 
The for-profit education sector is growing at an attractive rate 
— U.S. education spending has grown at a stable compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 5.7% 
since 1993. The for-profit component of this industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate 
training) is projected to grow faster than the overall historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual 
rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit operations in the sector, to reach a market 
size of $116 billion by 2010.7 
— In addition, these estimates do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational 
materials such as supplemental tutoring, which represented an estimated $20 billion of additional 
spending in 2004. 
• Increasing competition for human capital 
To remain competitive in the global economy, countries are investing heavily in the development of their 
human capital, especially at young ages 
— According to the World Bank's World Education Indicators, worldwide enrollment rates in pre-
primary education increased by 37% from 1995 to 2003.8 
— KUE believes that education companies will become significantly more valuable as countries 
become increasingly aware of the competitive advantages afforded by education. Of the top 100 
global companies by market cap, not a single education company is represented on the list. 
As globalization of the economy and improving technologies flatten the playing field, demand for more 
standardized education across regions increases  
— KUE believes that increasingly global education standards, enhanced workforce mobility and new 
technologies are catalysts of world competition for human capital. 
• Several international growth opportunities 
The Company is starting to execute on its international development strategy 
— In the near term, the Company is focusing on opportunities identified in the United Kingdom, Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China. Depending on the state and organization of each 
country's education sector, KUE's development will be executed through cooperation with 
government authorities, outright acquisitions and/or the establishment of partnerships with key local 
players. 
7 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. 
Source: Education Trends in Perspective: Analysis of the World Education Indicators, 2005. 
21 
— These initiatives could provide three key regional platforms for further development and 
consolidation. 
In the medium term, numerous opportunities for KUE should be generated by the increasing demand for 
quality for-profit educational offerings by governments and citizens around the world  
— Competitive pressures for development of human capital, deficiencies of national education 
systems, growth of a middle-class in China, India and the Middle East, demand for English 
language offerings and changing demographics are some of the primary drivers of increased 
demand internationally. 
— In China alone, 274 million children are under the age of 15, and 100 million are single-children 
under the age of 25, as a result of the one-child policy. These demographics result in large 
demand for education and increased spending capacity per child. 
I• Favorable demographic trends and customer behavior in the U.S. 
Growing number of working mothers 
— According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates, women are expected to represent 
nearly 48% of the total U.S. workforce by 2012, up from 46.6% in 2002.° 
— In the U.S., approximately 60% of mothers with children under the age of six are employed. 
Increasing birth rate  
— There are approximately 24 million children under the age of five in the U.S. today. According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau, absolute birth rates are going to continue to increase, and the population 
of children in the U.S. five and under is expected to increase to approximately 27 million by 2015.10 
Essential nature of the service to the consumer 
— As with healthcare, parents are primarily focused on the quality of the service that their child 
receives and the proximity of the center to their home or work; price is typically a secondary 
consideration. By relieving parents of the requirement to stay at home with their children, ECE 
allows both men and women to participate in the workforce and generate income for the 
household. 
1.2.2 Compelling Business Profile 
• KUE presents an attractive financial profile 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had operations in 39 states and Washington 
D.C. and generated pro forma revenue of $1.48 billion  
— With organic growth projected to be in excess of 5% per annum through 2011, geographic diversity 
and double-digit Adjusted EBITDA margins, KLC OpCo can generate attractive returns. 
— KLC OpCo generates strong operating cash flow (48% of 2005 pro forma Adjusted EBITDA) which 
provides significant resources to fund investment and support equity return-enhancing leverage, a

22 
capability that is expected to increase in line with the 13.5% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR projected 
until 2011. 
k12 continues to grow at an impressive rate, with annual enrollment growth proiected in excess of 25% 
over the next two years 
— Many of k12's direct costs are semi-fixed in nature (e.g., school administration) creating strong 
economies of scale as this business continues to grow. 
— With $70 million invested in the development of the platform for kindergarten to 9th grade classes, 
extension of the offering into new states and schools is expected to be achieved at relatively low 
costs.

— The programs are marketed primarily under the KinderCare, Children's Discovery Centers, 
Knowledge Beginnings, and Children's World brand names. KinderCare enjoyed 87% aided 
awareness as of November 2005.11 
• Superior competitive position of KLC OpCo as a result of proprietary curriculum, standards of 
excellence and experience and scale 
11 Source: Parthenon Conjoint Survey. 
23 
KLC OpCo has leveraged its scale and operational expertise to roll out a proprietary curriculum and to 
provide enhanced corporate level services 
— Curriculum has been developed, rolled out and refined over many years and provides a significant competitive advantage in an industry where small independent players do not have the resources to develop comparable programs. — Operational leverage allows for enhanced marketing, back-office, legal and compliance functions, keeping KLC OpCo at the forefront of education standards. Controls that meet or exceed requirements established by licensing authorities, state and federal 
government and accrediting bodies 
— Controls include rigorous and stringent hiring procedures and uniform rules for conduct. — 43% of KLC OpCo's centers, over four times the industry average of 10%, are accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (referred to herein as "NAEYC"), the nation's leading accreditation body. Management believes that all the Company's centers' operations and policies meet or are substantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation requirements. • A compelling business model at k12 As the state of education across the U.S. is generating increasing concerns, k12 provides a compelling 
value proposition 
— Children continue to perform poorly on assessment tests geared to measure reading, writing and math skills. The passing of legislation such as the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001" which, among other things, provides for increased funding for education and implementation of achievement level standards, demonstrates the commitment of government to address the issue. Technology and content platform easily leverageable to provide results-driven curriculum and service 
— With $70 million invested in the development of the platform for kindergarten to 9th grade classes, extension of the offering into new states and schools is expected to be achieved at relatively low costs. — k12 benefits from stable demand for its curriculum and services which is reflected by current reenrollment rates of 65% to 70%. — Many of the direct costs are semi-fixed in nature (e.g., school administration) creating strong economies of scale as this business continues to grow. • Valuable real estate portfolio of centers providing solid asset base 845 owned centers recently appraised at approximately $1.25 billion12 
— New organization separating management of real estate assets allows KLC OpCo education teams to focus on the core education business. — Long term partnership with Greenstreet Real Estate Partners ensuring state-of-the-art management of the real estate assets by a leader in this field. 
12 Actual appraisal was for 713 out of 845 centers and the appraised value was $1.1 billion. The $1.25 billion is achieved by taking the independent appraisal valuation methodology and extrapolating it to the remaining 132 centers.

B Strong leadership teams 
KUE 
___ Strong team of highly experienced professionals at the KUE level, led by CEO Lowell Milken, 
Chairman Michael Milken and Vice-Chairmen Steven Green and Ted Sanders. The team 
contributes an average of more than two decades of experience in their respective fields to KUE. 
___ Providing corporate headquarters support services in the areas of strategy and business 
development, acquisitions, recruiting of executives, communication and government relations. 
KLC OpCo 
— Highly experienced management team comprised of both experts in the field of education (C00 Dr. 
Elanna Yalow has substantial experience operating for-profit ECE centers), as well as business 
professionals. 
— Seasoned executive and middle management team with average Company tenure of ten years. 
k12 
— Chairman, Founder and acting CEO Ron Packard has extensive experience in the K-12 education 
space and was previously with KLC before founding k12. John Baule, Executive Vice President 
and CFO, served as CFO of Headstrong for five years before joining k12. 
1.2.3 Value Creating Strategy 
• Value is created by owning assets across the pre-K-12 education continuum 
Incremental value is expected to be created from strategic and financial synergies inherent in a global 
platform  
— The Company can exploit the similarities in various education markets by capitalizing on the assets 
it owns (e.g., using KLC's expertise to establish similar operations across geographies and across 
the pre-K-12 education continuum). 
— Sharing of best practices globally and ability to cross-sell products and services to the Company's 
customers. 
— Entry into less structured international markets early in their development cycle to establish 
attractive competitive positions. 
• Multiple growth opportunities at KLC and k12 
Top line organic growth at KLC OpCo is expected to be driven by several factors:  
___ Historically the industry has demonstrated a pattern of price increases above inflation. Historical 
industry data shows an average tuition rate increase of 7% per annum.13 
— Higher "Utilization"14 resulting from increased student enrollment, improved retention rates, further 
network rationalization to better align supply with demand, more favorable center build rate in the 
broader industry and favorable macro trends. 
"Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector 2002. 
25 
— The ECE industry generates approximately $54 billion in total spending in the U.S. and has grown 
at a compound annual growth rate of 10% since 1982. It is expected to grow at a 3.4% 
compounded annual rate through 2010 according to Harris Nesbitt research. The ECE industry's 
growth has been driven by several favorable social and demographic trends including: the increase 
in working mothers and single-parent or dual-income families, historically high birth rates, and 
increase in popularity of center-based care. 
___ Net opening of new centers as the integration of KinderCare winds down and the number of center 
openings starts exceeding the number of closures. 
— Leverage of KLC OpCo's footprint to market additional educational products and services to the 
more than 300,000 children KLC OpCo interacts with each year, their parents, grandparents and 
other child care providers. Selected incremental revenue opportunities include: foreign language or 
music lessons, educational materials and financial services (life insurance, health insurance, tuition 
financing, etc.). 
Growth through acquisitions and industry consolidation  
— Consolidation strategy supported by the highly fragmented early childhood industry, with for-profit 
chains representing only approximately 5% of the market in aggregate, and small independent 
providers representing 60% of the market.15 
___ Management has demonstrated an ability to grow through acquisitions, as evidenced by the three 
networks acquired by KLC since inception, of sizes up to 1,000 centers. 
Multiple drivers of expected double-digit growth at k12 
— Existing school enrollment rates at k12 expected to continue to increase at double digit rates for at 
least the next three years, as k12 further penetrates its existing markets through commercial and 
marketing push. 
— k12 currently operates virtual public schools in 11 states and the District of Columbia. As 
legislatures in other states permit the formation of virtual public schools, k12 expects to have 
opportunities to expand into new states. 
"Utilization is calculated as the total actual child care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential 
child care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total licensed capacity) during the related time 
period.

The General Partner will be the sole general partner of KUE 
and will hold approximately 1,000 General Partner Units 
("GP Units") in KUE, representing approximately 0.04% 
ownership in KUE. 
The economic interest in KUE represented by the Common 
28 
LP Units and the GP Units will be reduced by the Profits 
Participation LP Units as described below under 
"Distributions." 
Assuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by 
March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends on the 
preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, KUE LLC, 
controlled by the Principals, will hold approximately 
1,530,000 Common LP Units representing approximately 
60% ownership in KUE (excluding Profits Participation LP 
Units) and 1,530,000 Class A Shares. The Common LP 
Units owned by KUE LLC will not be transferable, except to 
(i) the Principals; (ii) to affiliates of the Principals; and/or OD 
to family members and/or charitable organizations in 
connection with the Principals' estate planning, unless 
combined with the corresponding percentage of Class A 
Shares to form Units and transferred in the form of Units in 
accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Knowledge Universe Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited 
liability company ("KUH LLC") controlled by the Principals, 
will hold 900 Class B ordinary shares of the General Partner 
(the "Class B Shares"). The Class B Shares held by the 
Principals and their affiliates will not be transferable, except 
to (i) the Principals; (H) to the affiliates of the Principals; 
and/or (iii) to family members and/or charitable organizations 
in connection with the Principals' estate planning. The Class 
B Shares will automatically convert to Class A Shares if the 
Principals' aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in 
KUE is less than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units 
(as defined below) of KUE. 
A limited liability company ("KULG LLC-1"), of which 
Knowledge Universe Learning Group LLC, a Delaware 
limited liability company that is controlled by the Principals 
("KULG"), and certain other persons designated by KULG 
are members, will be the holder of the Profits Participation 
LP Units (the "Profits Participation Limited Partner") with the 
economic rights as set forth in "— Distributions" below. At 
each closing of any sale of Units to Investors where the 
aggregate purchase price of all Units acquired by Investors 
to date is less than or equal to $1.5 billion (during the 
Offering Period or thereafter), the Profits Participation 
Limited Partner will be issued a number of Profits 
Participation LP Units such that the aggregate shall equal at 
least 9/11ths of the 11% of "Partnership Units" (Common LP 
Units, GP Units, and Profits Participation LP Units) that may 
be represented by Profits Participation LP Units. Additional 
Profits Participation LP Units will be issued to the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner, at such time and in such 
numbers as the Profits Participation Limited Partner will 
direct, based upon the issuance by the Profit Participation 
Limited Partner of interests to members of the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner (who may include employees, 
officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its 
29 
subsidiaries and joint ventures as designated by KULG other 
than the Principals and their affiliates), the vesting schedule 
of such interests, and whether certain tax elections are made 
by the recipients of such interests; provided, however, the 
total number of Profits Participation LP Units shall not 
exceed a number equal to eleven percent (11%) of the 
aggregate number of Partnership Units. Any increase in the 
number of Profits Participation LP Units following the sale of 
the first $1.5 billion of Common LP Units to Investors 
requires a majority vote of the Independent Committee. 
Subsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may 
raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt 
securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner 
units outstanding upon completion of this offering but KUE 
may issue limited partner units with preferences over the 
Common LP Units in the future and may amend the Limited 
Partnership Agreement accordingly. 
Distributions: 
First, to the Common Limited Partners and the General 
Partner in proportion to and to the extent of their unreturned 
Capital Contributions, but in no case may a distribution 
pursuant to this paragraph exceed a Partner's positive 
adjusted capital account balance; 
Second, to the Common Limited Partners and the General 
Partner and the Profits Participation Limited Partner (with 
respect to Profits Participation Units theretofore allocated to 
persons other than the Principals and their Affiliates, if 
specified by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, but not 
with respect to more than 2/11ths of the Profits Participation 
Units) to the extent of an 8% preferred return; 
Third, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in the 
additional amount the Profits Participation Limited Partner 
would have received pursuant to the prior paragraph if it had 
fully participated in the distribution of the 8% preferred return 
with respect to all outstanding Profits Participation Units; and 
Fourth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner, and the General Partner in 
proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. 
Distributions may be made in cash or in kind. Allocations of 
income, gains, profits and losses are described in "The 
Structure of KUE and the General Partner" in this Private 
Placement Memorandum. 
The Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General 
Partner the authority to override the distribution provisions of 
the Limited Partnership Agreement described above in order 
to achieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which 
is: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital Contributions to 
them; (ii) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the 
General Partner to receive their Preferred Return while the 
30 
Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an 
amount equal to a fraction of the amount the Common 
Limited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant 
to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the 
portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation 
Limited Partner other than the Principals), multiplied by the 
number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner divided by the number of outstanding Units other 
than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner; (iii) third, for the Profits Participation Limited Partner 
to receive an amount equal to a fraction of the amount the 
Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received 
pursuant to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal 
to the portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation 
Limited Partner attributable to members of the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner who are Principals or their 
affiliates), multiplied by the number of Units held by the 
Profits Participation Limited Partner divided by the number of 
outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner; and (iv) finally, for all Partners 
(including the Profits Participation Limited Partner) to share 
in the profits of the Partnership in proportion to the number 
of Units held by them. 
Notwithstanding any contrary provisions below addressing 
equal merger consideration, in connection with any 
distribution of securities of a subsidiary entity which has high 
vote and low vote (or non-voting) securities with substantially 
equivalent economic rights, the Principals can receive the 
high-vote securities in such a distribution while the other 
holders of Common LP Units receive the low vote (or non-
voting) securities, as long as the securities otherwise have 
substantially equivalent economic rights and the high-vote 
securities have mandatory conversion features equivalent to 
the mandatory conversion provision of the Class B Shares. 
Equal Merger Consideration Provision: The Principals (through KUE LLC) and the Investors will 
receive the same consideration per Common LP Unit and/or 
Class A/Class B Shares in connection with a sale, merger, 
recapitalization, share repurchase, dividend, or any other 
transaction where all holders of Common LP Units or shares 
in the General Partner receive consideration with respect to 
their Common LP Units or shares, other than with respect to 
corporate restructuring transactions, such as a holding 
company merger, conversion of KUE from an exempted 
limited partnership to a corporation or other entity, change of 
domicile, or any other transaction that the Independent 
Committee determines is a "corporate restructuring." In any 
such corporate restructuring transaction, the Principals 
(through KUE LLC) may receive securities with high-voting 
rights and the Investors may receive securities with limited or 
no voting rights so long as the consideration received by the 
Principals (through KUE LLC) and the other Partners per 
31 
Common LP Unit have substantially equivalent economic 
provisions. 
Fixed Overhead Payment: 
KUE and/or one or more of its subsidiaries will pay $20 
million annually to KULG in quarterly installments beginning 
July 1, 2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment 
Agreement as an agreed upon payment to provide for the 
reimbursement of expenses and other costs incurred by 
KULG on behalf of KUE and its subsidiaries (including, but 
not limited to, salaries and bonuses of KULG employees 
providing services to KUE and its subsidiaries, fees and 
expenses relating to financing transactions and acquisitions, 
professional fees and other administrative expenses). To 
the extent that the U.S. $2,500,000 fee payable pursuant to 
an existing management services agreement with 
Knowledge Learning Corporation is paid to any person or 
entity other than a subsidiary of KUE, the amount payable to 
KULG by KUE will be reduced by the amount of such 
payment to such other person or entity. The $20 million 
annual fee will terminate upon the Initial Listing (as defined 
below) or the sale of KUE to a person or entity that is not a 
KUE LLC Entity. 
Voting Rights: The General Partner will manage and operate KUE. 
The Investors will have no voting rights on matters affecting 
Company business with respect to their Common LP Units in 
KUE because the Investors will be limited partners of KUE. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions, 
KUE must obtain the consent of (a) the holders of a majority 
of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals to 
amend the Limited Partnership Agreement in a manner that 
is adverse to the Common LP holders and (b) the holders of 
at least 90% of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the 
Principals to amend the "Equal Merger Consideration 
Provision" described above. In addition, the General Partner 
may not take any action to (a) alter or add to its Articles or 
(b) alter or add to its Memorandum with respect to any 
objects, powers or other matters specified therein that would 
adversely affect the rights of holders of Class A Shares 
without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the 
Class A Shares. 
Holders of the Class A Shares of the General Partner will 
have one vote per share. The holders of Class B Shares, 
will have in the aggregate one more vote than the requisite 
legal vote required to approve particular matters. In addition, 
the Investors will have the right to elect directors to the 
Board of Directors of the General Partner as set forth in 
"Board of Directors" below. 
The Class B Shares will automatically convert to Class A 
Shares if the Principals' aggregate direct and indirect 
economic interest in KUE is less than 15% of the 
32 
outstanding Partnership Units of KUE. 
Board of Directors: 
Initial Listing Process: 
The General Partner will have a Board of Directors initially 
consisting of up to 13 persons. 
Following the first closing of the offering and prior to the 
"Initial Listing" (as defined below), the outside Investor 
(including its affiliates) holding the greatest number of shares 
in the General Partner at the first closing of the offering will 
appoint two directors of the General Partner and the holders 
of the Class B Shares will appoint the remaining directors. 
Following the initial appointment of the Board, the Board 
may, in its sole discretion, increase the number of directors, 
including to accommodate investors that invest subsequent 
to the initial closing of the offering of the Units, provided that 
the outside Investor appointing two directors pursuant to the 
paragraph above shall have the right to appoint additional 
directors as required to maintain a ratio of such Investor's 
designees to total Board members of not less than 2/15ths. 
"Independent Directors" of the Board of Directors of the 
General Partner shall be individuals who (a) are not (i) a 
Principal, (ii) a family member of a Principal, (iii) an 
employee of a Principal or any entity controlled by one or 
more of the Principals, and (b) meet the definition of 
"independent director" set forth in Rule 303A.02 of the New 
York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (as if the 
General Partner, the Partnership and each of its Subsidiaries 
were the "listed company") , including any such individuals 
appointed by the Investors who otherwise satisfy the 
requirements of this definition. 
At the time of the final closing of this offering, the General 
Partner will have at least two Independent Directors. After 
the Initial Listing and so long as consistent with contractual, 
listing and licensing obligations, a majority of the board of 
directors of the listed company will be Independent 
Directors. 
"Initial Listing" means a listing on a recognized international 
securities exchange with a substantially concurrent 
underwritten offering generating gross proceeds of U.S. 
$200 million or more. "Initial Listing" refers to the Initial 
Listing of KUE or any successor or any subsidiary of KUE to 
which substantially all of KUE's assets and liabilities have 
been transferred or are held. 
The General Partner may take and cause KUE to take such 
actions as the General Partner reasonably deems necessary 
to complete the Initial Listing on the recognized international 
securities exchange or exchanges selected by the General 
Partner, including without limitation a restructuring or 
reorganization or other transaction or asset transfer between 
or among KUE and any of its subsidiaries, and may require 
33 
Partners to exchange their interests in KUE and the General 
Partner for interests in a subsidiary of KUE. 
Related Party Transactions: 
Related party transactions include transactions between (1) 
any of the Principals or any of their affiliates or any entity 
controlled by any of the Principals, and (2) KUE or any direct 
or indirect subsidiary or joint venture of KUE involving more 
than $1 million (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any 
merger, acquisition, asset purchase or similar transaction 
between KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, on the one 
hand, and any person of which fifteen percent (15%) or more 
of the voting stock (or similar voting interests) is owned by 
KUE LLC or its affiliates, on the other hand). Related party 
transactions do not include (a) any transaction solely 
between or among KUE and any of its direct or indirect 
subsidiaries or joint ventures in which the Principals do not 
have any direct or indirect ownership interest (other than as 
a result of their ownership in the General Partner and KUE), 
(b) reasonable and customary director, advisory board 
member, or consultant compensation and benefits 
(including, without limitation, retirement, health, stock option 
and other benefit plans) as approved by the Independent 
Committee, provided that any such compensation, benefits 
and arrangements to the Principals that do not exceed $1 
million in the aggregate annually shall not be subject to such 
approval, and customary indemnification arrangements, (c) 
transactions and arrangements pursuant to or contemplated 
by express terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement of 
KUE, including the "Investment in Subsidiaries" and "Co-
Invest Right" described below, and any payments pursuant 
thereto, and the Fixed Overhead Payment described above, 
(d) agreements, transactions and arrangements described in 
"Related Party Transactions" in this Private Placement 
Memorandum and any amendment thereto (so long as such 
amendment is not disadvantageous to the Investors as a 
whole in any material respect) or any transaction 
contemplated thereby and any payments pursuant thereto, 
and (e) admissions of any affiliate of the Principals to KUE 
as a Limited Partner on terms substantially equivalent to 
concurrent admissions of persons that are not affiliates of 
the Principals. 
If the size of the related party transaction is greater than $1 
million and equal to or less than $50 million, then either (a) 
the Independent Committee must approve the transaction or 
(b) the transaction must be approved by the holders of a 
majority of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the 
Principals. 
If the size of the related party transaction is greater than $50 
million, then the transaction must be approved by both (a) 
the Independent Committee and (b) the holders of a majority 
of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals. 
34 
Investment in Subsidiaries: 
Transferability of Units: 
Tag-Along Right: 
Not in limitation of any commitments or restrictions the 
Principals may have entered into, prior to an Initial Listing, 
KUE may not permit any of its subsidiaries or controlled joint 
ventures (which shall not include, for the avoidance of doubt, 
certain exempt companies contemplated by the following 
paragraph) to issue or grant any equity interests in such 
subsidiaries or controlled joint ventures to any of the 
Principals or any of their affiliates (other than KUE, its 
subsidiaries and controlled joint ventures) unless (i) the 
Independent Committee approves and the Investors who are 
accredited investors (as such term is defined in Regulation 
D) or otherwise legally eligible to participate are offered the 
opportunity to participate on the same terms as the 
Principals and their affiliates and in proportion to their 
economic ownership of KUE or (ii) such subsidiary or joint 
venture of KUE has completed an initial listing on a 
recognized international securities exchange, subject to 
certain limited exceptions. 
The Principals intend that KUE will be their exclusive vehicle 
for equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-
profit companies engaged primarily in the business of pre-K 
through 12th grade education of children, subject to limited 
exceptions as set forth in "The Structure of KUE and the 
General Partner" in this Private Placement Memorandum. 
The Common LP Units and the Class A Shares comprising 
the Units owned by the Investors will not be separately 
transferable, and the Units are to be transferred as a whole 
unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors of the 
General Partner and the Independent Committee (defined 
below). 
Units held by an Investor may not be sold, transferred or 
assigned without the prior written consent of the General 
Partner, not to be unreasonably withheld. The General 
Partner intends, during the first two years after the applicable 
closing of the offering, to approve transfers of the Units to an 
affiliate of the Investor, in compliance with applicable law. 
After such time, the General Partner intends to approve 
transfers of Units to an affiliate of the Investor or to another 
Investor (and affiliates thereof), in each case in compliance 
with applicable law. The General Partner also intends to 
approve transfers pursuant to the Tag-Along Right and Drag-
Along Right provisions described below. 
Unless the Investors' Units (or securities received in 
exchange for Units if the Initial Listing is of a Subsidiary of 
KUE) are freely tradable without volume restrictions on the 
exchange on which the Initial Listing occurred, with respect 
to any proposed transfer of the Common LP Units held by 
KUE LLC and its affiliates to a non-affiliate purchaser (and, 
unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and the 
Independent Committee of the General Partner, a 
35 
corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held by KUE 
LLC), the Investors may sell a pro rata portion of their 
Common LP Units and corresponding Class A Shares in the 
proposed transfer on the same terms and in exchange for 
the same consideration per Unit (and Class A Share) 
received by KUE LLC and its affiliates. 
Following the Initial Listing, the tag-along right will continue 
for certain Investors with respect to transfers for value of the 
Units (or units of the listed entity as the case may be) by the 
Principals or their affiliates to non-affiliates (excluding 
transfers on a recognized international securities exchange) 
above the following thresholds in one or more transactions: 
(i) 15% of the Principals' original KUE holdings to any single 
buyer (or affiliates of that buyer) or (i) 33% of the Principals' 
original KUE holdings in the aggregate. 
Drag-Along Right: 
Co-Invest Right: 
Additional Listing of Investors' Units: 
Prior to the Initial Listing, with respect to any proposed 
transfer of a majority of the Units held by KUE LLC to a 
proposed non-affiliate purchaser (and, unless otherwise 
approved by the Board of Directors and the Independent 
Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding 
percentage of Class A Shares held by KUE LLC), the 
Investors may be required to sell a pro rata portion of their 
Units and corresponding Class A Shares in the proposed 
transfer on the same terms and in exchange for the same 
consideration received by KUE LLC. 
Prior to the Initial Listing, if KUE proposes to issue for cash 
any Units or securities convertible into Units after the 
Offering Period (subject to certain exceptions), then KUE is 
required to offer to each Investor that is an accredited 
investor (as such term is defined in Regulation D) or 
otherwise legally eligible to participate in the offering, the 
right to purchase a pro rata portion of such securities. 
Prior to the Initial Listing, the Investors have substantially 
equivalent rights with respect to issuances of securities by 
the General Partner. 
Beginning any time after six months after the Initial Listing, 
one or more holders holding an aggregate of $100 million of 
more of the Units may request KUE and the General Partner 
to take such action as may be necessary for their Units to be 
freely tradable and not subject to volume restrictions on the 
international securities exchange on which the Initial Listing 
occurred; provided that no more than one such action may 
be required in any 12 month period and customary cut-back 
and other provisions will apply in any such listing or 
underwritten transaction, as the case may be. KUE will use 
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such action to 
cover such holders and the securities of any other holders 
legally eligible to participate in such action. 
36 
Term: The term of KUE will be indefinite, unless terminated earlier 
in accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Illiquidity Period: 
KUE will operate for a period of seven years from the date of 
the first closing of this offering. If there has not been an 
Initial Listing by the end of seven years from the date of the 
first closing of this offering, the Board of Directors of the 
General Partner will determine whether to pursue a sale of 
KUE or an Initial Listing (or a dual track process); provided, 
however, in the event that not less than 75% of the value of 
KUE at that time is represented by shares of securities listed 
on one or more recognized international securities 
exchanges and such shares have been or will be distributed 
as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the Investors 
and the Investors have received distributions of cash and/or 
such securities valued at amounts equal to or in excess of 
their original capital contributions, then there shall be two 
extensions of one year's duration each in order for KUE to 
complete either an Initial Listing or to have the remaining 
value of KUE represented by shares of securities listed on a 
recognized international securities exchange and to 
distribute such shares to the Investors. The Board of 
Directors shall approve the desired course of action. 
If the Board determines to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial 
Listing or a dual track process), then the Principals must 
determine at such time whether they intend to participate as 
a potential bidder in the sale process. 
If the Principals elect not to participate as a potential bidder 
in a sale process, then they will not be allowed to 
subsequently elect to participate as a potential bidder unless 
the sale process does not result in a buyer at a price the 
Independent Committee deems to be "fair." If the sale 
process results in a transaction that the Independent 
Committee deems to be "fair", the Principals will be required 
to sell their entire stake in KUE (Common LP Units and 
Profits Participation LP Units on an "as converted" basis) on 
the same terms as the Investors. 
If the Principals elect to participate as a potential bidder in a 
sale process, then the sale process will be managed by the 
Independent Committee and the Principals will be precluded 
from participating in Board deliberations regarding the sale 
process. In addition, the Principals will be required to sell 
their entire stake in KUE on the same terms as the Investors 
to the winning bidder in the event the Principals do not 
submit the most attractive bid. 
In the event that a sale of KUE or an Initial Listing has not 
occurred within nine years from the date the first Investors 
are admitted to KUE, the Independent Committee shall 
determine whether to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial 
Listing or a dual track process). A majority vote of the 
37 
Independent Committee on this issue shall be binding on the 
Board of Directors of the General Partner and will require the 
Board of Directors of the General Partner to pursue such 
action within ninety (90) days. 
Indemnification: KUE will indemnify the General Partner and its members, 
officers, directors, and employees, and at the General 
Partner's discretion, any other person providing services to 
KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures. KUE has provided a 
customary indemnity to the Agents in connection with their 
services. 
Periodic Reporting: KUE will provide annual audited financial statements and 
semi-annual reports. The General Partner will provide such 
periodic reports if engaged in any business other than acting 
as general partner of KUE or if it owns any material assets 
other than an interest in KUE.

3. USE OF PROCEEDS 
The proceeds of this offering will be used: (i) to expand operations, including through strategic 
acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally, (H) to develop new products and services, (Hi) to repay, in 
whole or in part, $150 million of existing debt plus accrued interest (including through application of a 
portion of the proceeds of the initial closing of the offering after payment of expenses and preferred 
returns), which currently bears interest at either the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.125% or the base 
rate (generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time), (iv) to pay an 
estimated $50 million in fees and expenses (including amounts payable to the Agents and including 
amounts payable from July 1, 2006 under the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement), (v) in the discretion 
of KUE LLC, payment at the initial closing of the offering of approximately $7.0 million of accrued return 
on the preferred limited partner units of KUE being converted to Common LP Units if such accrued return 
is not converted to Common LP Units and (vi) for other corporate purposes. Until the proceeds are used, 
KUE currently intends to invest the unapplied proceeds in cash-equivalents and short-term marketable 
securities.

5. SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA 
The following summary historical pro forma and projected financial data should be read in conjunction 
with the financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of 
Operations" presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" 
elsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of our acquisition 
of KinderCare in January 2005 and for the separation of our business into operating (KLC OpCo) and 
property (KLC PropCo) in November 2005, as if those transactions and related financing had occurred on 
January 1, 2004. The rental income received by KLC PropCo in all periods presented is primarily 
comprised of lease payments from KLC OpCo. 
Our pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the 
SEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of 
our 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this section does not 
include a comparison of KLC's historical GAAP consolidated operating results or segment information that 
would be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. In addition, the non-GAAP financial 
information presented below does not comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the 
SEC. For further information, please see KLC's GAAP financial statements and those of KinderCare 
included in this Memorandum. 
The pro forma presentation below is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements. 
Instead, it is based on a "ground up" combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital 
expenditures) and internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC's results. 
The primary reasons for the presentation based on internal reports are different fiscal year ends and 
expense classification between KLC and KinderCare. 
Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but 
which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. For a discussion of the assumptions, see "The 
Operating Company (KLC OpCo) - Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion" and "The 
Real Estate Company (KLC PropCo) - Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion." Our 
ability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty 
and our performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in 
"Risk Factors" elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also "Forward-Looking Statements."

6. RISK FACTORS 
Investment in the Units involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. As a 
result, the purchase of the Units should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford a loss 
of their entire investment. Prospective investors should carefully consider, in addition to matters set forth 
elsewhere in this Memorandum, the following factors relating to the business of the Company and this 
offering. The order in which risk factors appear is not intended as an indication of the relative weight or 
importance thereof. Prospective investors should carefully review all risk factors. Such information is 
presented as of the date hereof and is subject to change without notice. The discussion in this 
Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results 
may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could 
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. The 
occurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of 
operations or cash flow. Risks described herein that could affect KLC are also likely to be similar for other 
pre-K-12 businesses we may acquire or develop. Other businesses we acquire or develop in foreign 
countries or in different markets, may be subject to risks in addition to those discussed below. 
6.1. Risks Related to Our Business 
6.1.1 Risks associated with growth through acquisitions; potential inability to 
consummate transactions 
A principal component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of other businesses or interests 
therein that will complement and/or expand the Company's businesses and the products and services that 
they offer. The successful implementation of this strategy will depend upon a number of factors, including 
the ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, consummate such transactions on favorable 
terms and integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the Company. Identifying, 
completing and realizing on attractive acquisitions are highly competitive and involves a high degree of 
uncertainty. The Company will be competing for acquisitions with other companies, private equity firms, 
as well as individuals and others, which often results in increased acquisition prices. There can be no 
assurance that the Company will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or that if identified, 
the Company will be able to consummate such transactions on suitable terms, or that acquired 
businesses will perform as expected or generate returns. 
In addition to risks facing education companies similar to those facing KLC as described herein, 
acquisitions of businesses also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated 
liabilities and contingencies, diversion of Company management attention and possible adverse effects 
on earnings resulting from increased amortization of goodwill, increased interest costs, the issuance of 
additional securities and difficulties related to the integration of the acquired business. No assurance can 
be given as to the success of the Company in executing and integrating acquisitions in the future. The 
Company's failure or inability to successfully implement and manage its acquisition strategy would have a 
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business. 
The Company may from time to time enter into negotiations in anticipation of consummating an 
acquisition transaction. However, there is no assurance that such negotiations will be successful and the 
diversion of management attention on such unsuccessful transactions may adversely affect 
managements ability to pursue other business opportunities. 
In addition, KLC PropCo intends to acquire diversified real estate interests, including investments in non-
education related properties. The performance of this acquisition strategy in general, or of any particular 
property, cannot be predicted. 
44 
The initial closing of this offering will require a minimum investment (including the amount attributable to 
KUE LLC through conversion of its preferred limited partner units, including accrued dividends at the 
option of KUE LLC, into Common LP Units) of U.S. $280.0 million. There can be no assurance of 
additional closings after the initial closing of the offering, whether before the completion of the Offering 
Period on March 31, 2007 or thereafter. Unless there are subsequent closings or offerings, cash 
available for acquisitions and expansion would be limited to available cash of KLC and KUE and proceeds 
of future financings of KLC and KUE. 
6.1.2 The Company plans to acquire or invest in non-U.S. companies. This 
international expansion strategy is untested, and may include acquisitions or 
developments in countries where for-profit education is not well established 
Foreign acquisitions involve certain risks not typically associated with U.S. acquisitions, including risks 
relating to (i) currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. 
dollar and the various foreign currencies in which the Company's non-U.S. interests are denominated, 
and costs associated with conversion from one currency into another; (ii) differences between the U.S. 
and foreign securities markets, including potential price volatility in and relative illiquidity of some foreign 
securities markets, the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards and disclosure 
requirements and less governmental supervision and regulation; (Hi) certain economic and political risks, 
including potential restrictions on foreign acquisition and repatriation of capital, and the risks of political, 
economic or social instability and the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; (iv) the possible 
imposition of foreign taxes on income and gains; and (v) differences in applicable legal systems, including 
the possibility that the Company may experience difficulty in asserting legal claims or obtaining legal 
remedies against sellers of businesses in foreign jurisdictions. 
The Company's prior operating history is limited to its U.S.-based businesses. Historical results may not 
be indicative of future performance outside the U.S. The Company's non-U.S. businesses may operate in 
countries in which the legal and regulatory frameworks, customary business models, education practices 
and philosophies and political and social norms are substantially different from those in the U.S. 
International expansion may also involve significant market risks, and opportunities to realize synergies 
may be limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its international 
expansion strategy. 
In addition, the Company may acquire businesses or pursue business development opportunities in 
countries where for-profit education is not well-established, which may involve greater risks than those 
associated with similar U.S. acquisitions and developments. For example, the performance of a for-profit 
education company located in a country where for-profit education is in an embryonic stage may be 
volatile. Such a company also may be unable to achieve the growth or success achieved by education 
businesses in countries, such as the U.S., where for-profit education is more established. In addition, 
there can be no assurance that for-profit education will ever become well-established or maintain viability 
in any given country. If any of the above events occur, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss of 
capital invested in that business or development. 
6.1.3 The Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled 
employees 
The success of the Company will depend in part on continued employment of senior management and 
other key personnel, particularly the Principals. See the discussion under the heading "The Company 
may not engage in certain businesses" below. If one or more senior management or key personnel 
become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, the business and operations of the 
Company would be disrupted. 
The success of the Company also depends on attracting and retaining highly trained financial, marketing 
and other personnel. The Company will need to continue to hire additional personnel as its business 
grows. The market for hiring such personnel is competitive and hiring such personnel may require 
increased salaries and enhanced benefits under certain circumstances. A shortage in the number of 
45 
skilled personnel could limit the ability of the Company to increase sales of existing products and services 
and launch new product offerings. 
6.1.4 The Company has significant leverage, and expects to incur additional debt, 
which could result in adverse effects on its financial condition 
The Company has significant leverage and expects to incur additional debt in connection with the 
acquisition and operation of its businesses. Although the Company intends to use leverage in a manner it 
believes to be prudent, the leveraged capital structure the Company plans to utilize may significantly 
increase the Company's exposure to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in 
the economy or deteriorations in the condition of the businesses or their respective industries. If a 
business cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet debt obligations, the Company may suffer a partial 
or total loss of capital invested in such business. 
The Company's ability to service its substantial indebtedness, and meet its other obligations depends on 
its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of 
which are outside the Company's control. The Company cannot be certain that its cash flow will be 
sufficient for such purposes. If the Company does not have enough liquidity, it may be required to 
refinance all or part of its existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. The Company cannot 
guarantee that it will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or 
future debt agreements, may restrict the Company from pursuing any of these alternatives. 
The substantial level of indebtedness incurred by the Company may have the following consequences of 
potential concern to investors in the Company: 
• The Company must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest and 
principal on its indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other business purposes such 
as capital expenditures; 
• The Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, 
acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; 
• The Company may be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds; 
• The Company may have a higher level of indebtedness than some of its competitors, which may 
put it at a competitive disadvantage and reduce its flexibility in planning for, or responding to, 
changing conditions in its industry, including increased competition; and 
• The Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments than it 
would without the leverage. 
Adverse developments in the Company's financial condition would have adverse effects upon the 
business and results of the Company as a whole. 
6.1.5 The Company faces intense competition in the early childhood care and 
education services industry from numerous other types of providers 
The early childhood care and education services industry is competitive and highly fragmented. The most 
important competitive factors generally are quality, convenience and, to a lesser extent, price. The 
Company's, specifically KLC OpCo's, competition in this industry consists principally of: 
• other for-profit, center-based child care providers, including franchise organizations; 
• preschool, kindergarten and before and after school programs provided by public schools; 
46 
• local nursery schools and child care centers, including church-affiliated and other non-profit 
centers; 
• providers of child care services that operate out of homes; and 
• substitutes for group child care, such as relatives, nannies and stay-at-home parents. 
In many markets, the Company faces competition from preschool services and before and after school 
programs offered by public schools that provide such services at little or no cost to parents. The number 
of school districts offering these services is growing, and we expect increased competition from such 
services in the future. In addition, local nursery schools, child care centers and in-home providers 
generally charge less for their services than the Company. Many denominational and other non-profit 
child care centers have lower operating expenses than the Company and may receive donations and/or 
other funding to subsidize operating expenses. Consequently, operators of such centers often charge 
lower tuition rates than us. Moreover, fees for home-based care are normally substantially lower than 
fees for center-based care. 
6.1.6 The Company may acquire companies that are not well-established or are 
experiencing financial difficulties 
The Company may acquire less established companies. Acquisitions of interests in such companies may 
involve greater risks than are generally associated with acquisitions of more established or stable 
companies. For example, such companies may have shorter operating histories on which to predict 
future performance and may have negative cash flow. Their performance may be more volatile and they 
may be unable to sustain the growth rates or success achieved by established companies. In the case of 
start-up enterprises, such companies may not have significant or any operating revenues. Such 
companies also may have a lower capitalization and fewer resources (including cash) and may be more 
vulnerable to failure, resulting in the loss of the Company's entire investment in such company. In 
addition, less mature companies could be more susceptible to irregular accounting or other fraudulent 
practices. In such event, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss of capital invested in that 
company. 
The Company has invested in troubled companies in the past, and may make future investments in 
companies that are experiencing, or are expected to experience, financial difficulties. If such difficulties 
are not overcome, the Company may lose part or all of any equity investment in such companies. 
6.1.7 KUE will rely on the management teams of its subsidiaries 
While KUE will retain overall control and set the strategic direction of the Company, day-to-day operations 
at the subsidiary level will be the responsibility of the management teams at the subsidiary level. There 
can be no assurance that the existing management teams, or any successor, of any acquired business 
will be able to operate such business in accordance with KUE's plans and/or objectives. 
6.1.8 The Company has a non-controlling interest in k12 with limited rights as a 
shareholder and may acquire minority interests in other entities 
The Company holds a non-controlling interest in k12 and may in the future acquire minority interests in 
other companies. Holding a minority interest limits the Company's ability to protect its interests in and to 
influence management of k12. Any future investments in minority interests of other companies will likely 
involve similar limitations. 
In addition, the Company may co-acquire interests in businesses or develop businesses with third parties 
through joint ventures or other entities, which may have larger or controlling ownership interests in such 
companies. In such cases, the Company will rely significantly on the existing management and boards of 
directors of such companies, which may include representatives of other investors with whom the 
Company is not affiliated and whose interests may at times conflict with the interests of the Company. 
47 
Such interests may involve risks in connection with such third-party involvement, including the possibility 
that a third-party may be in a position to take (or block) action in a manner contrary to the Company's 
objectives or may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such interest. Acquisitions 
made with third parties in joint ventures or other entities also may involve carried interests and/or other 
fees payable to such third party partners or co-venturers. There can be no assurance that desirable 
minority shareholder rights will be available or that such rights will provide sufficient protection of the 
Company's interests. 
6.1.9 Certain of the Company's businesses may require additional capital 
Certain of the Company's businesses, especially those in development phases, may require additional 
financing to satisfy their working capital requirements. The amount of the additional financing needed will 
depend upon the maturity and objectives of the particular business. The Company may seek to raise any 
required capital from different sources, and subsidiaries in foreign countries may raise capital locally. The 
availability of capital is generally a function of capital market conditions that are beyond the control of the 
Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to predict accurately the future 
capital requirements necessary for success or that additional funds will be available from any source as 
needed. An inability to timely raise capital may materially and adversely affect the Company and/or its 
business. 
6.1.10 KUE's subsidiaries operate in regulated industries; failure to comply with 
governmental regulation and licensing requirements could have a material 
adverse effect on operations 
The pre-K-12 education business is highly regulated and is often subsidized with government funding or 
reimbursement programs. In addition, KUE and its subsidiaries may require the consent or approval of 
applicable regulatory authorities in order to acquire or operate particular businesses, including in foreign 
jurisdictions where the Company has limited or no experience with the regulatory framework. Failure to 
comply with applicable laws or regulations, or failure or inability to obtain applicable approvals, could have 
a material adverse effect on the operations of KUE and/or its subsidiaries. 
For example, KLC's centers and school programs are subject to numerous state and local regulations and 
licensing requirements. KLC has policies and procedures in place to assist in complying with such 
regulations and requirements. Although these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, government 
agencies generally review, among other things, the fitness and adequacy of buildings and equipment, the 
ratio of staff personnel to enrolled children, staff training, record keeping, children's dietary program, the 
daily curriculum, and compliance with health and safety standards and transportation safety. In most 
jurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the centers and licenses 
must be renewed periodically. Most jurisdictions establish requirements for background checks or other 
clearance procedures for new employees of child care centers and school programs. Repeated failures 
by any of KLC's centers to comply with applicable regulations may result in sanctions against that center 
or program and other centers or programs in the same jurisdiction, including probation or, in more serious 
cases, suspension or revocation of a center's or program's license to operate. In addition, this type of 
action could attract negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction. 
A licensing authority may determine that a particular center or program is in violation of applicable 
regulations and may take action against that center or program and possibly other centers or programs in 
the same jurisdiction. For more information, see The Operating Company (KLC OpCo) — Licensing and 
Government Regulation." 
6.1.11 Future legislation or new regulations may place additional burdens on the 
Company and have a material adverse effect on operations 
Additional, different and/or more stringent regulations and licensing requirements may become applicable 
in the future due to changes in laws and regulations, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing 
laws and regulations, changes in the Company's business strategy or for other reasons. State authorities 
48 
routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and may implement changes that 
significantly increase operating costs. For example, a change in the required ratio of child center staff 
personnel to enrolled children in a certain jurisdiction could increase KLC center or program staff 
operating expenses in that jurisdiction and therefore have a material adverse effect on KLC's operations. 
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to (i) obtain all required regulatory approvals 
that it does not yet have or that it may require in the future; (i) obtain any necessary modifications to 
existing regulatory approvals; or (iii) maintain required regulatory approvals. Delay in obtaining or failure 
to obtain and maintain in full force and effect any regulatory approvals, or amendments thereto, or delay 
or failure to satisfy any regulatory conditions or other applicable requirements, could prevent operation of 
the facility or sales to third parties, or could result in additional costs to the Company. 
6.1.12 Conflicts of interest may arise with the Principals and their affiliates 
The Principals will agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) that KUE will be their exclusive 
vehicle for equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-profit companies engaged primarily in 
the business of pre-K through 12th grade education of children (other than companies in which the 
Principals or their affiliates directly or indirectly owns fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or 
similar voting interests) as of the date of the first closing of the offering, which are LeapFrog Enterprises, 
Inc. and Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.). The Principals will not acquire or make an equity investment 
in such companies unless such acquisition or investment opportunity has been first presented to the 
Independent Committee and subsequently declined by the Independent Committee or initially pursued but 
later abandoned by KUE. See "The Structure of KUE and the General Partner — Investment in 
Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures." In addition, existing companies in which KULG and/or its principals are 
investors along with other unrelated investors may invest in or acquire companies involved in areas 
relating to education. 
Following the consummation of the offering, the Principals will control the General Partner other than with 
respect to certain actions requiring Investor approval as further described in "The Structure of KUE and 
the General Partner." Conflicts could emerge between the Principals and the Company in the future, 
including conflicts due to the other business segments in which the Principals may have interests, 
separate from the Company. In addition, affiliates of the Principals will have certain financial interests in 
KUE and certain of its subsidiaries as described in "Related Party Transactions" following the 
consummation of the offering independent of their ownership of the Units, which may present conflicts of 
interest. 
Certain other potential conflicts of interest include: 
• Other activities of management — the Principals and other senior management personnel of the 
Company are subject to a variety of prior and continuing obligations unrelated to the Company. 
Accordingly, conflicts may arise in the allocation of management time and resources. 
• Lack of separate counsel for Investors — no separate counsel has been engaged by the Company 
to act on behalf of Investors in the Company. 
• For a description of existing arrangements between the Company and its affiliates, see "Related 
Party Transactions." 
• For a description of certain restrictions on one of the Principals and the Company, see "The 
Company may not engage in certain businesses" below. 
By acquiring an interest in the Company, each Investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the 
existence of any such actual or potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to 
any liability arising from the existence of any such conflict of interest. 
49 
6.1.13 The Company may not engage in certain businesses 
On February 24, 1998, without admitting or denying liability, Michael R. Milken consented to the entry of a 
final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Securities and Exchange 
Commission v. Michael R. Milken et al., which judgment was entered on February 26, 1998 restraining 
and enjoining Michael Milken from associating with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, investment 
company or municipal securities dealer, and from violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). On March 11, 1991, in the action entitled In the Matter of 
Michael R. Milken, the SEC instituted a proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and 
ordered that Michael Milken be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, 
investment company or municipal securities dealer. On April 24, 1990, concurrently with a plea agreement 
covering criminal violations of federal securities laws, Michael Milken also consented, without admitting or 
denying liability, to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Incorporated, et al., restraining and enjoining Michael Milken from engaging in transactions, acts, 
practices and courses of business which constitute or would constitute violations of, or which aid and abet 
or would aid and abet violations of, Sections 7(c), 7(f), 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(d), 14(e), 15(c)(3) and 17(a)(1) of 
the Exchange Act, and Regulations T and X and Rules 10b-5, 10b-6, 13d-1, 13d-2, 14e-3, 15c3-1, 17a-3 
and 17a-4 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. 
The Company cannot be in the business of or associated with a broker, dealer, investment company, 
investment advisor, or municipal securities dealer (collectively, "prohibited businesses"). As a result, the 
Company cannot pursue any acquisitions or investments that may have the effect of the Company being 
in any prohibited business. This could adversely affect the Company's ability to make and/or hold 
investments or acquisitions which may otherwise be consistent with its business objectives. 
6.1.14 Litigation and adverse publicity concerning alleged incidents at KLC or other 
child care centers could hurt KLC's reputation 
KLC is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and 
litigation involving allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Any such allegations, claims or 
lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's 
financial position, operating results or cash flows. 
Personal trust and parent referrals play a key role in the child care business. KLC believes its success is 
directly related to its reputation and favorable brand identity. KLC is periodically subject to claims and 
litigation alleging negligence, inadequate supervision and other grounds for liability arising from injuries or 
other harm to children. In addition, claimants may seek damages from KLC for child abuse, sexual abuse 
or other criminal acts arising out of alleged incidents at KLC's centers. There are lengthy statute of 
limitations periods applicable to child abuse and personal injury claims. Such claims may typically be 
brought until a number of years after a claimant reaches the age of majority. Any adverse publicity 
concerning such incidents at one of KLC's child care centers, or child care centers generally, could greatly 
damage KLC's reputation and could have an adverse effect on occupancy levels at KLC's centers. 
6.1.15 KLC's insurance policies may be inadequate to cover claims, and KLC may be 
unable to maintain existing coverage in the future at reasonable prices 
Some operators of child care centers have experienced difficulty obtaining general liability insurance or 
other liability insurance that covers child abuse. KLC maintains insurance policies to protect against 
relevant liability exposures in amounts KLC considers to be appropriate. In addition, KLC's owned 
centers are covered by blanket insurance policies, including property insurance. Although KLC has not 
historically had to pay any claims exceeding its coverage, claims in excess of, or not included within, its 
coverage may be asserted. To the extent that any claims are not covered by insurance, KLC will be 
forced to cover the associated costs itself, which will reduce the amount of cash KLC has available for 
other business purposes. 
50 
Insurance premiums have increased significantly in the past and may increase in the future because of 
market conditions in the insurance business generally, conditions in the child care industry more 
particularly or KLC's situation specifically. KLC cannot be certain of the cost or coverage it will obtain with 
replacements of existing policies, which will depend on the factors described above. 
6.1.16 Factors beyond the Company's control, such as economic conditions, may 
adversely affect the demand for child care services 
Demand for child care services is subject to fluctuations in general economic conditions, and the 
Company's revenues depend, in part, on the number of working mothers and working single parents who 
require child care services. Recessionary pressure on the economy, and a consequent reduction in the 
general labor force, may adversely impact the Company because out-of-work parents tend to stop using 
child care services. In addition, certain demographic trends which are favorable to the Company's 
business, including the increasing percentage of mothers in the workforce and the growth in population of 
children of the age needing child care, as well as trends in the preference of working parents and 
employers for center based child care, may not continue. Other factors beyond the Company's control 
could adversely affect demand, such as terrorism, natural disasters and epidemics. 
Children attending KLC's facilities are generally enrolled on a weekly basis. Accordingly, any change in 
economic conditions or other external factors affecting demand will impact us more quickly than 
businesses with longer contractual periods. 
6.1.17 A loss or reduction of government funding for child care assistance programs or 
food reimbursement programs could adversely affect KLC 
Federal and state child care assistance programs accounted for approximately 20% of KLC's revenues 
during the one year period ended December 31, 2005. These funds are primarily from the Child Care 
and Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, which are designed to assist low-income families 
with child care expenses and are administered through various state agencies. Although additional 
funding for child care may be available for low income families as part of welfare reform and the 
reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, KLC may not 
benefit from any such additional funding. 
KLC is eligible to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, or CACFP, which provides 
reimbursement for meals and snacks that meet certain USDA approved nutritional guidelines. Centers 
can qualify to participate in the CACFP by meeting one of two tests: 25% or more of the enrolled students 
receive child care assistance funding or 25% or more of the center's customers have household incomes 
that are at or below state specified income levels. Reimbursement is calculated based on the percentage 
of the center's customers that fall into a "free" or "reduced" income category established by the state. 
Federal or state child care assistance programs may not continue to be funded at current levels, 
particularly with large budget deficits putting pressure on discretionary spending programs. In addition, 
many states have recently experienced fiscal problems and have reduced or may in the future reduce 
spending on social services. A termination or reduction in funding of child care assistance programs 
could have a material adverse effect on KLC's business. 
Adverse changes to the national or local economies may result in an increase in the number of families 
eligible for child care assistance. In order to compensate for such increases, state or local governments 
have in the past, and may in the future, increased parent co-payments required under such programs or 
change the eligibility requirements to reduce the number of families eligible to participate in such 
programs. An increase in the required parent co-payments may discourage parents from sending their 
children to KLC's centers. An increase in required parent co-payments also increases KLC's exposure to 
the risk of non-payment by these parents. 
In addition, states which reduce funding for child care may be unable to qualify to receive funds under the 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Such states may utilize funds under the 
51 
Child Care and Development Block Grant to provide child care assistance to needy families in lieu of 
TANF funds, thereby reducing the amount of funds available to other families, including families that 
utilize KLC's child care centers. 
6.1.18 A termination or reduction of tax credits for child care could have a material 
adverse effect on KLC's business 
KLC may enjoy heightened demand for its services because of tax incentives for child care programs. 
Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to herein as the "Code"), 
provides a federal income tax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of specified child care expenses with 
maximum eligible expenses of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children. The fees paid to 
KLC by eligible taxpayers for child care services qualify for these tax credits, subject to the limitations of 
Section 21 of the Code. However, these tax incentives are subject to change. 
Code Section 45F provides incentives to employers to offset costs related to employer provided child care 
facilities. Costs related to (a) acquiring or constructing property used as a qualified child care center, (b) 
operating an existing child care center, or (c) contracting with an independent child care operator to care 
for the children of the taxpayer's employees will qualify for the credit. The credit amount is 25% of the 
qualified costs. An additional credit of 10% of qualified expenses for child care resource and referral 
services has also been enacted. The maximum credit available for any taxpayer is $150,000 per tax year. 
Many states offer tax credits in addition to the federal credits discussed above. Credit programs vary by 
state and may apply to both the individual taxpayer and the employer. A termination or reduction of such 
tax credits could have a material adverse effect on KLC's business. 
6.1.19 Material weaknesses in KLC's internal controls were discovered during KLC's 
2005 audit 
For a discussion of certain material weaknesses in KLC's internal controls discovered in KLC's 2005 audit, 
see "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for 
the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003" in Appendix B. To address these issues, and as part of 
the Company's growth plan, KLC is increasing expenditures on IT systems and accounting and IT 
personnel. 
6.1.20 If KLC is unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees, if 
minimum wage rates increase or if KLC's employees unionize, KLC's results of 
operations may be adversely affected 
KLC believes that its success is largely dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees. 
Many of KLC's child care center staff are entry level wage earning employees, and turnover in this 
industry has traditionally been significant. If KLC is unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified 
employees (particularly center directors and supervising employees) or are only able to hire or retain such 
employees by providing significantly greater salaries, wages and benefits than KLC currently does as a 
result of increases in the federal or state minimum wage rates or other market conditions, KLC's 
operations may be adversely affected. 
Since early 1998, union organization efforts in the child care industry have received considerable 
publicity. While union officials associated with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees and Service Employees International have repeatedly announced their intention to engage in 
a nation-wide effort to organize child care workers, organization efforts have been focused on 
government-funded providers. To date, efforts to organize employees of for-profit providers have been 
minimal. However, organizational efforts may occur and, if successful, could have an adverse effect on 
KLC's relationships with employees and KLC's labor costs. In addition, the general publicity surrounding 
such efforts, even if not focused on KLC's centers, could result in increased wages for child care workers 
and, as a result, increase KLC's labor costs. 
52 
6.1.21 Because KLC (through KLC PropCo) owns or leases a substantial number of real 
properties, and expects to invest in additional properties, results of operations 
could be adversely affected if environmental contamination is discovered on any 
of the properties 
KLC is subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that may 
impose liability for damages resulting from past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous 
substances as well as clean up costs. In particular, under applicable environmental laws, KLC may be 
responsible for investigating and remediating environmental conditions and may be subject to associated 
liability, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, relating to KLC's properties. These obligations 
could arise whether KLC owns or leases the property at issue and regardless of whether the 
environmental conditions were created by KLC or by a prior owner or tenant. Environmental conditions 
unknown to KLC at this time relating to prior, existing or future properties may be discovered and may 
have a material adverse effect on KLC's results of operations. 
6.1.22 KUE has a limited history 
While certain subsidiaries of KUE have a financial and an operating history, KUE has only recently been 
organized and has relatively little financial or operating history upon which prospective investors may 
evaluate its performance, and has not prepared separate or consolidated financial statements. The prior 
performance of the subsidiaries of KUE described herein may not be indicative of the future results of the 
Company. 
6.2. Tax Risks 
6.2.1 Certain tax considerations generally applicable to Investors subject to U.S. tax 
liability 
KUE is expected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Investor that 
is subject to U.S. federal income tax liability will take into account its allocable share of items of income, 
gain, loss, deduction, and credit of KUE (as determined under the Limited Partnership Agreement), 
without regard to whether it has received distributions from KUE. As a result, the tax liability to an 
Investor resulting from such allocation may exceed the cash distributions made by KUE to the Investor. 
Further, upon the sale of its Common LP Units, an Investor may, depending on the amount of Company 
debt, if any, and the Investor's adjusted tax basis, incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash 
received. 
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), or other taxing authority may challenge the manner in 
which income, gains, losses and deductions are allocated to holders of Common LP Units, the General 
Partner and holders of the Profits Participation LP Units under the Limited Partnership Agreement. For 
U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocation of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction to a partner in 
a partnership will be given effect so long as the allocation has "substantial economic effect," or is 
otherwise in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership. If an allocation of an item pursuant 
to the Limited Partnership Agreement does not satisfy this standard or is deemed not to satisfy this 
standard by the IRS, it will be reallocated by the IRS among the Partners on the basis of their respective 
interests in KUE (as determined by the IRS), taking into account all facts and circumstances. In such a 
case, Investors could have additional tax liabilities or suffer adverse tax consequences. 
An investment in KUE will give rise to a variety of complex U.S. federal income tax and other tax issues 
for Investors. Certain of those issues may relate to special rules applicable to certain types of Investors 
subject to U.S. tax, such as tax-exempt entities, foundations, life insurance companies, banks, dealers, in 
securities, U.S. persons who own 10% or more of KUE and non-U.S. persons and entities. Prospective 
Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with specific reference to their situations concerning an 
investment in KUE. 
53 
6.2.2 Tax-Exempt and Non-U.S. Investors may become subject to U.S. Tax 
KUE business activities could generate income that will be taxable to certain otherwise tax-exempt 
Investors as "unrelated business taxable income." Although, under the Limited Partnership Agreement, 
the General Partner is required to use its reasonable best efforts not to engage in, or invest in (other than 
through an entity that is not a pass-through entity) a pass-through entity that engages in, any activity 
which constitutes the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and generates income which 
constitutes "effectively connected income" in the hands of the non-U.S. Investors that own Common LP 
Units, it is possible that some of KUE's business activities and acquisitions could generate income that is 
"effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business which could create U.S. federal income tax reporting, 
tax liability, and tax withholding for non-U.S. Investors. Additionally, KUE believes that neither KUE nor 
its subsidiaries is currently a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation ("USRPHC") for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that in the 
future KUE and/or its subsidiaries may become a USRPHC if, for example, the value of the U.S. real 
estate holdings of KUE or such subsidiary increases sufficiently. A disposition of an interest in a 
USRPHC could create gain for non-U.S. Investors which would be treated as if the non-U.S. Investor 
were engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. and as if such gain were effectively connected with 
such trade or business. This would create U.S. federal income tax reporting, tax liability and withholding 
for non-U.S. Investors. Investors that are non-U.S. persons are urged to consult their tax advisors 
regarding the potential application of the USRPHC rules to their investment in KUE. 
6.2.3 Investors may become subject to taxation in non-U.S. jurisdictions 
KUE expects to make investments in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and KUE, its subsidiaries and/or the 
Investors may be subject to income or other tax in those jurisdictions. In addition, local tax incurred in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions by KUE or subsidiaries through which it invests may not entitle Investors to either (i) 
a credit against tax that may be owed in the U.S. or their respective local tax jurisdictions, or (ii) a 
deduction against income taxable in the U.S. or such local jurisdictions by the Investors. 
6.2.4 Controlled Foreign Corporations 
KUE anticipates that it and/or its subsidiaries will invest in non-U.S. operations. Depending upon the 
percentage of ownership of such operations by KUE and its subsidiaries and the type of legal entity 
chosen for such operations, these non-U.S. operations could be classified as a Controlled Foreign 
Corporation ("CFC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity is classified as a CFC, certain 
types of income could be taxable to U.S. persons owning 10% or more of KUE for U.S. income tax 
purposes, even if no distributions of cash are made from such entity, and gain from the disposition of 
such entity would be taxed as if it were a dividend to the extent of such entity's earnings and profits, 
rather than as a capital gain, for U.S. income tax purposes. 
6.2.5 Treatment of KUE as a U.S. Entity 
Under the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their 
income. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation, 
referred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S. 
corporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S. 
corporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S. 
Secretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-U.S. 
corporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision, 
including adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose. Recently issued 
Treasury regulations provide that the anti-inversion legislation is applicable to a foreign partnership that is 
or becomes a "publicly traded partnership" within two years of the acquisition by it of a U.S. corporation. 
A "publicly traded partnership" is any partnership (i) interests in which are traded on an established 
securities market, or (ii) interests in which are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial 
equivalent thereof). KUE believes that it is not currently a publicly traded partnership and does not intend 
54 
to become a publicly traded partnership within two years of this offering or the acquisition of KLC and k12. 
As a result, KUE does not believe the anti-inversion legislation or any regulations promulgated within the 
scope of the legislation's regulatory authority should apply to KUE although no assurance can be given in 
this regard or with respect to any new acquisitions of or investments in U.S. corporations. In addition, 
KUE does not believe that any other Code provision subjecting non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal 
income tax should apply to KUE or its subsidiaries, although no assurance can be in this regards. The 
promulgation of contrary regulations or a successful challenge of either of these positions by the Internal 
Revenue Service could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and, thus, could result in a substantial 
reduction of the value of the Units. 
6.2.6 Currency Fluctuations 
An investment in KUE is a U.S. dollar denominated investment. Contributions to and distributions from 
KUE will be made in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in value between the U.S. dollar and the Investor's 
functional currency (if other than the U.S. dollar) may result in taxable income to the Investor. 
6.2.7 Reporting Requirements 
Investors who are U.S. Persons will be required to file an IRS Form 8865 with the Investor's U.S. federal 
income tax return for the taxable year in which the Investor purchases the Common LP Units. Investors 
who are U.S. Persons may, depending upon the size of their investment in the General Partner, be 
required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the Investor's U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year in 
which the Investor purchases Class A ordinary shares in the General Partner. Additionally, depending on 
the type of non-U.S. investments KUE makes, Investors who are U.S. Persons may be required to file 
additional IRS Forms such as a Form 5471 in subsequent years. 
6.3. Risks Related to Projections 
6.3.1 The projections included in this Memorandum and otherwise provided to 
potential Investors are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties; 
potential Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such projections 
The projections included in this Memorandum and other models and forecasts that may be presented to 
or discussed with Investors represent management's best estimates as of the date of this Memorandum 
of KLC's, KLC OpCo's and KLC PropCo's projected results of operations for the years ended December 
31, 2006 to 2011 (the "Projections"). The Projections were not prepared with a view toward compliance 
with published guidelines of the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or any 
regulatory or professional agency or body or generally accepted accounting principles of the U.S. or any 
other country. In addition, neither the Agents, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent 
auditors, nor any other independent expert, accountant or counsel has examined, reviewed or compiled 
the Projections and, consequently, assume no responsibility for them. The Projections should be read 
together with, and are qualified in their entirety by, the information contained in the rest of this "Risk 
Factors" section, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of Operations," 
"Business" and the financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this Memorandum. 
The Projections do not include any expenses of any entity within the Company above the KLC level, 
including KUE expenses ($17.5 million of the $20.0 million payable pursuant to the Fixed Overhead 
Payment Agreement) that will be payable by KUE for administrative and other services. See "Related 
Party Transactions." The Projections also do not include any projected expenses relating to grants of 
Profits Participation Units or other equity-related grants, including for the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan 
at Knowledge Schools, Inc. ("KSI"), pursuant to which payments may be made based on different 
valuations of KSI stock and are based on the same multiples of Adjusted EBITDA used in 2005; actual 
valuations are conducted annually and may be higher or lower. Finally, the Projections do not reflect 
projected interest expenses on KUE debt. 
55 
The Projections do not assume that the Company will make any future material acquisitions, even though 
the Company expects to use the proceeds of the sale of the Units, among other purposes, for 
acquisitions, which will likely affect actual performance and cause it to differ from the Projections. The 
Projections assume the success of the Company's operating strategy, although no assurance can be 
given that the Company's strategy will be effective or that the anticipated benefits from the strategy will be 
realized in the periods for which the Projections have been prepared. The assumptions described herein 
are those that the Company believes are most significant to the Projections; however, not all assumptions 
used in preparing the Projections have been set forth herein. 
The Projections, in general, assume that: (i) the Company will not be negatively or positively impacted by 
any material legal proceedings; (ii) there will be no material change in any of the Company's existing 
contracts or leases; (iii) there will be no change in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. 
that will have a material effect on the financial results of the Company; (iv) there will be no labor disputes, 
natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics (such as avian flu) or other disturbances that would 
materially affect the operations or revenues of the Company; and (v) that worldwide economic conditions 
and economic conditions in the U.S. remain generally favorable and consistent with those prevailing on 
the date of this Memorandum. 
The Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered 
reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive 
risks, uncertainties and contingencies which are beyond the control of KLC, and upon assumptions with 
respect to future business decisions which are subject to change. Accordingly, the Projections are only 
an estimate, and actual results will vary from the Projections, and these variations may be material. 
Consequently, the inclusion of the Projections herein should not be regarded as a representation of the 
Company, its advisors, the Agents, or any other person of results that will actually be achieved. 
Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it is usually the case that one or more of the 
assumptions in projections do not materialize. Prospective purchasers of the Units are cautioned not to 
place undue reliance on the Projections. 
The limited k12 projections contained in this Memorandum were received from k12 management and 
were not prepared by the Company or its management. 
The Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances 
existing after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that 
any or all of the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition. Furthermore, the Company does not 
intend to update or revise the Projections to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. 
6.4. Risks Related to Investing in the Units 
6.4.1 There will be significant unallocated net proceeds from the offering 
If there are additional closings after the initial closing of the offering, after repayment of KUE's debt, a 
significant amount of the anticipated net proceeds from the offering of the Units may not have been 
designated for specific uses. Therefore, the Company's management will have broad discretion within 
the business scope of the Company with respect to the use of the net proceeds of the offering. There can 
be no assurance that the uses of proceeds will benefit the Company or Investors. 
6.4.2 Investors will only have limited rights to receive ongoing information about the 
Company 
Other than as expressly provided in the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE (the "Limited Partnership 
Agreement), the Company does not expect to provide ongoing detailed information regarding its 
business, financial condition or results of operations to Investors. The Limited Partnership Agreement 
provides that Investors shall receive yearly audited financial statements of the Company, as well as semi-
56 
annual reports on the Company's operations. In addition, Investors have the right to access certain other 
information regarding the Company as provided for in the Limited Partnership Agreement. As long as the 
Units are not registered under the Exchange Act, the Company will not be subject to the reporting 
requirements thereunder. KLC's 2005 audit was not completed until May 2006 due to systems 
conversion issues. 
6.4.3 Investors may never receive cash distributions on their investment; there is no 
assurance of investment return 
There is no assurance that KUE will be able to generate returns for the Investors or that returns will be 
commensurate with the risks of investing in KUE. There may be limited or no cash flow available to KUE 
from its subsidiaries or to the Investors from KUE and there can be no assurance that KUE will make any 
distributions to Investors. KUE is not obligated to declare cash distributions with respect to the Units 
other than certain distributions to meet tax obligations of the Investors. Public offerings, sales or other 
dispositions which may result in a return of capital or the realization of gains, if any, are not expected to 
occur for a number of years. An investment in KUE should only be considered by persons who can 
reasonably afford a loss of their entire investment. 
6.4.4 KUE's ability to make distributions is limited by its subsidiaries' existing and 
future indebtedness 
KUE will not have any material assets other than its ownership of various subsidiaries (including KLC) 
and investments in other companies, and will not have any material operations or revenues other than 
income derived from KUE's interest in its subsidiaries and any proceeds arising from its investments in 
other companies. Therefore, KUE's ability to make any distributions to Investors will be completely 
dependent on the operations and business results of its subsidiaries and its investment holdings. 
KLC's ability to make distributions or payments to KUE is restricted by the provisions of its various debt 
agreements, including without limitation, the Indenture, dated as of February 2, 2005, by and between 
KLC, the Guarantors, as defined therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Therefore, KLC may be 
prevented from making distributions or payments to KUE as and when needed by KUE. Such restrictions 
may adversely affect the business and operations of KUE as a whole and the value of any investment in 
KUE. Similar restrictions may apply to future indebtedness incurred by KLC and other subsidiaries of 
KUE. 
6.4.5 There is no public market for, and Investors may be unable to sell, the Units 
There is no public trading market for the Units and one is not expected to develop. The economic risks of 
this investment must be borne for an indefinite period of time. Neither the Units nor the underlying 
Common LP Units or Class A Shares will be registered under the Securities Act or under any state 
securities laws (or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction). Each Investor will be required to 
represent that it is purchasing the Units for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to 
resale or distribution. Although the General Partner intends to approve permitted transfers specified in 
the LPA, and not to unreasonably withhold consent to transfers, all transfers require the prior approval of 
the General Partner under Caymans Law, and no transfer of the Units may be made unless the transfer 
complies with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement. Although the Limited Partnership 
Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General Partner permit the foregoing 
transfers and the General Partner has agreed with certain Investors to approve such transfers, applicable 
Cayman Islands law gives the General Partner full discretion to approve or disapprove transfers. 
Each transfer must be registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an 
exemption must be available. These restrictions will be noted on a legend placed on each certificate, if 
any, representing the Units. As a precondition to the effectiveness of any transfer, the Company may 
require the transferor to provide an opinion of legal counsel stating that the transfer is in accordance with 
the Securities Act and to pay any costs the Company incurs in connection with the transfer. It is not 
currently contemplated that the Units will be registered under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or 
57 
other securities laws. In addition, certain provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which permit 
the resale, subject to various terms and conditions, of restricted securities after they have been held for 
one year, do not apply to the Units because the Company is not required to file and does not file, current 
reports under the Exchange Act and does not, and does not intend to, make comparable information 
publicly available. 
6.4.6 Purchasers of the Units are subject to Dilution 
Although we have not prepared a consolidated balance sheet for KUE, prior to this offering and the 
conversion of $180 million of KUE's preferred limited partner units currently held by the Principals and 
their affiliates into Common LP Units at the per Common LP Unit issuance price, we expect that KUE 
would have negative or nominally positive common equity book value due to its historical capital structure, 
including its level of indebtedness. As a result, the book value per Unit acquired in this offering will be 
substantially less after this offering than the purchase price paid by the Investors. The Investors interests 
are also subject to future dilution if and to the extent the Company grants options, profits interest units or 
similar rights to officers, directors or employees of the Company, and will also be affected by any awards 
by the Company under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan described 
under "Management Incentive Plans and Employment Agreements." Investors will have a Co-invest Right 
to purchase a pro-rata portion of certain issuances of Units by the Company for cash; however, such right 
is subject to customary exceptions. See "The Structure of KUE and the General Partner." 
6.4.7 KUE and the General Partner are not U.S. entities; disputes must be resolved by 
binding arbitration in the United Kingdom 
KUE will be a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The General Partner is a Cayman Islands 
exempted company. The internal governance of KUE will be pursuant to the Limited Partnership 
Agreement in compliance with applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. The internal governance of the 
General Partner will be pursuant to the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the agreement 
among members in compliance with applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. All disputes under the 
applicable agreements or related to this offering must be resolved through binding arbitration conducted 
in the United Kingdom under the London Court of International Arbitration Rules. Such laws and Rules 
may offer less or different protections to Investors than laws applicable to comparable U.S. entities or 
laws of the Investors' home countries. 
6.4.8 The Company will not be operated to optimize the investment, tax or other 
objectives of any individual Investor 
The Investors may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in 
the Company. The conflicting interests of individual Investors may relate to or arise from, among other 
things, the nature of investments made by the Company and the structuring or the acquisition of 
investments. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the 
General Partner, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments, that may be more 
beneficial for one Investor than for another Investor, especially with respect to Investors' individual tax 
situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Company, the General Partner will 
consider the investment and tax objectives of the Company as a whole, not the investment, tax or other 
objectives of any individual Investor. Investors must seek their own investment, tax and other advice 
concerning an investment in the Units. 
6.4.9 The Investors may not separately transfer the constituent securities underlying 
the Units 
The Investors may not separately transfer Common LP Units or Class A Shares (unless otherwise 
approved by the Board of Directors of the General Partner and the Independent Committee), and there 
may be less Investor interest in a security such as the Units than there would be in more traditional 
58 
corporate or partnership investments. This restriction may adversely affect an Investors' ability to transfer 
the Units in the future. 
6.4.10 Under certain circumstances, the General Partner may cause an Investor's 
interest in KUE to be redeemed or transferred 
Under circumstances where the continuing participation in KUE by an Investor would have a material 
adverse effect on the Company, the General Partner may cause an Investor's interest in KUE to be 
redeemed or transferred. See "Limitation of a Limited Partner's Participation" in Section 4.11 of the 
Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE.

7. DISTRIBUTION POLICY 
We intend to retain any future earnings to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions and growth and 
do not expect to make distributions for the foreseeable future. Any determination to make distributions in 
the future will be at the discretion of the General Partner and will depend upon our results of operations, 
financial condition and other factors, as the General Partner, in its discretion, deems relevant. Limitations 
in the credit facility and indenture of KLC restrict distributions by KLC that could, in turn, be made 
available for future distributions by KUE to its partners.

8. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
8.1. Human Capital 
Historically, the world economy has been viewed as being driven by an asset base of natural resources. 
This has shifted to an economy driven by industrial and financial resources. This perception is reinforced 
through the statistics and measurements used by governments, as seen in the Federal Reserve's 
representation of the U.S. balance sheet. However, it is KUE's view that the real assets of a city, state, 
region or country are its people (human capital) and their productive capacity. KUE believes that national 
economies that fail to embrace this concept will be left behind. Nobel Prize winning economist Gary 
Becker estimates that in today's service based economy, human capital accounts for 76% of the assets in 
the U.S.

Importantly in today's economy, the value of a company is increasingly driven by creativity, innovation 
and education. Companies are recognizing that human capital is their defining asset. With the value of 
education becoming apparent to government and businesses alike, the Principals believe that a 
significant opportunity exists to create an education company that will promote and cultivate human 
capital. Today, not a single education company ranks in the top 100 worldwide as measured by market 
capitalization. Within 20 years, KUE believes that the education space will contain some of the largest 
companies in the world. 
8.1.1 Enhancing Human Capital through Education 
Education is a primary factor in improving an individual's life-long productivity. Studies have shown that a 
higher level of education leads to increased lifetime earnings, and that this is increasingly true in the new, 
knowledge economy. 
61 
As shown below, an individual with a professional degree earns approximately 100% more than a college 
graduate and an individual with a bachelor's degree earns approximately 70% more than a high school 
graduate in their lifetime.

high school. Only one-third of the 25% of Americans who have received a bachelor's degree, or 8%, 
have received a graduate degree.16 
Studies by Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman suggest that the highest rate of return within 
education is generated through an investment in early childhood programs. Heckman's study asserts, 
"The rate of return to a dollar investment made while a person is young is higher than the rate of return to 
the same dollar made at a later age," as illustrated below:

Due to the high rate of return of investments in ECE and the principles underlying the theory of human 
capital, KUE has made its largest initial investment in KLC, the largest company serving the ECE market 
in the world.

8.2. The Education Market 
Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross 
national income of $48 trillion.17 In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1.0 trillion market with for-
profit education accounting for $81 billion or 7.8% of this amount.18 The for-profit component of this 
industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate training) is projected to grow faster than the overall 
historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit 
operations in the sector, to reach a market size of $116 billion by 2010.19 Education is still predominantly 
provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE believes that the 
industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the evolution observed 
in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and telecommunications.

8.3. The U.S. Early Childcare or "pre-K" Market 
The highly fragmented early childcare or "pre-K" market includes care based in homes and housed by 
community organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, YMCAs) and center based facilities. Center-
based childcare includes preschools (nurseries), workplace centers (located on-site at the company), 
lease-model centers (located in a real estate developer's office building), back-up centers (a variety of on-
site and off-site back-up care programs) and family day-care facilities (located in someone's home or 
center). Although childcare may evoke thoughts of a babysitting service, education has become an 
increasingly important element in services to pre-K children. However, the education-focused portion of 
the childcare market remains relatively small. 
Since the early 1980s, center-based ECE has become the care provider of choice for families. The U.S. 
ECE unit generated an estimated $54 billion in total spending in 2005, representing a 10% compound 
annual growth rate since 1982.19 Approximately five million or 60% of 3 to 5-year-olds with working 
mothers are enrolled in ECE centers. 9 The following growth drivers are expected to continue to fuel 
growth in the early childcare market: growing importance of ECE, demographics (e.g., more children aged 
five and younger), increase in families with two working parents, more educated parents, corporations 
recognizing the benefits of childcare services and tax incentives and other positive legislation. 
The perception of ECE as a fundamental component of child development has contributed to average 
annual fee increases of roughly 7% amongst center-based facilities, reflecting the stable, relatively 
inelastic nature of the demand for higher quality care.21 The number of children receiving childcare

outside the home grew from 10.6 million in 1999 to an estimated 12 million in 2003, an increase of 3.1% 
annually.22 
8.3.1 Early Childhood Education's Role in the Economy 
ECE enables people to pursue income-generating activities by allowing parents to participate in the 
workforce and contribute to the economy. A recent study found that every dollar spent on the formal ECE 
sector generates approximately 15 dollars worth of additional earnings by parents. 23 Furthermore, 
evidence suggests that regardless of family income, children who have participated in ECE programs do 
better in school than their peers who did not. ECE also reduces social and economic costs by lowering 
school dropout rates, and leads to decreased levels of criminal activity. These social and demographic 
forces have established ECE as a fundamental component of today's economic 'infrastructure' and a 
source of economic growth. 
Given these and other supporting facts, education is an industry that is of growing importance to the 
economy. This growth is driven by the following factors: 
M Growing public awareness of the importance of early childhood education. ECE has received 
increased media and government attention as scientific research highlights the importance of 
education during a child's early developmental years. Children who attend high quality ECE centers 
demonstrate greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems 
throughout their educational lives, when compared with children receiving no or lower quality care. 
These differences hold true for children from a range of family backgrounds.24 
• Favorable demographic trends. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual 
number of live births in the U.S. was approximately 4.1 million in 2003, compared to approximately 3.6 
million in 1980, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects the annual number of live births to increase to 
approximately 4.5 million in 2015.25 The number of children aged five years or under grew from 
approximately 22.5 million in 1990 to approximately 23.4 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau, and is projected to reach 26.8 million in 2015.22

Source: U.S. Census Bureau. 
• Changing workforce composition. A rising percentage of women participate in the workforce due to an 
increasingly higher cost of living, a desire for financial independence and an elevated standard of 
living preference, which necessitates two full-time wage earners for most families. Of the nearly 65 
million jobs created nationally between 1964 and 1997, 40 million were occupied by women. Today, 
more than 62% of mothers with children under the age of six work full-time compared to 19% in 1960.

64 
• Highly educated parents spend more on childcare. The increasing number of college graduates in the 
U.S. and abroad will support continued expenditures on ECE. In 2001, 70% of children with college-
educated mothers attended childcare programs, while only 38% of children whose mothers had less 
than a high school degree attended childcare programs. A recent report by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce reveals that families with college degrees spent an average of $92.67 per week (per child) 
on childcare in 2000, whereas parents without a high school degree only spent an average of $59.70 
per week per child.26 
• Increasing demand for Employer-Sponsored Centers. With increased levels of employment, 
corporations are witnessing growing demand for ECE services. Companies benefit from offering 
childcare services to their employees as (i) it often reduces employee absenteeism; (ii) serves as a 
perquisite, which differentiates the employer's compensation package; and (iii) tends to lower turnover 
rates. ECE services contribute to a stable and consistent workforce. 
• Favorable tax incentives. Certain tax incentives are available to parents utilizing childcare programs. 
Specifically, Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a federal income tax credit (Child and 
Dependent Care Credit) ranging from 20% to 35% (increased in 2003) of certain childcare expenses 
for "qualifying individuals." The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a 
Federal Employer Tax Credit for certain childcare expenses beginning in 2002. Employers can 
receive a credit of 25% of their spending on the construction or rehabilitation of a child care facility or 
on contracts with a third party child care facility to provide child care services to employees. 
Corporations also benefit from tax incentives of up to $150,000 per year. 
8.3.2 Industry Characteristics 
The ECE sector has a number of favorable operating characteristics. First, well-run school operators 
enjoy high returns on capital, predictable revenue streams and strong free cash flows, with students 
generally paying in advance of services delivered. Second, industry data shows that tuition rates have 
increased by approximately 7%, a rate which has exceeded inflation.27 The current outlook suggests no 
change in this dynamic. Third, government regulation and licensing standards represent notable barriers 
to entry. 
Given that education is a universally accepted product, management believes that our business model is 
highly scalable. The basic center model is expected to be essentially repeatable and transferable to new 
markets and locations. With labor representing approximately 50% of the total operating cost structure, 
companies within this sector tend to benefit from a variable cost structure, which allows them to reduce 
costs as economic and market conditions change. 
Often the demanding requirements for the selection of school directors and teachers can limit the pool of 
qualified employees for the industry. Low pay also tends to result in high turnover rates of approximately 
50% annually within the industry. 
8.3.3 Competitive Landscape: Early Childhood Education 
The ECE sector is highly fragmented with the top six providers representing approximately 5% of all 
organized ECE centers. The Company's primary competitors are (i) local nursery schools and child care 
centers, some of which are non-profit (including religious-affiliated centers), (H) providers of services that 
operate out of their homes and (Hi) other for-profit companies which may operate a number of centers. 
Local nursery schools and ECE centers generally charge less for their services. Many religious-affiliated 
and other non-profit child care centers have no or lower rental costs than for-profit chains, may receive 
donations or other funding to cover operating expenses and may utilize volunteers for staffing. 
Consequently, tuition rates at these centers are commonly lower than the Company's rates.

There are also several national chains, such as Bright Horizons Family Solutions, La Petite Academy, 
Learning Care Group (ABC Learning) and Nobel Learning Communities, or regional for-profit companies 
with sizeable numbers of centers and similar economies of scale in curriculum development, marketing 
and site development.

KLC OpCo successfully competes against these companies, with the following differentiating factors: (i) 
strong brand equity; (ii) a strong management team; (iii) grass roots level marketing; and (iv) a larger 
network of community centers. KLC also has a number of employer-sponsored centers that gives the 
Company greater breadth and depth. Finally, KLC is the only large competitor in the sector owned by an 
education company. Following is a brief description of each of several of the national competitors. 
I ABC Learning (Public, traded on the ASX) 
The Learning Care Group, ABC Learning's U.S. operating segment, has over 30,000 children enrolled 
(full and part-time) nationwide. Under the Childtime and Tutor Time segments, Learning Care operates 
child care centers and under the Franchise segment it licenses and provides developmental and 
administrative support to franchises operating under the Tutor Time brand. As of October 14, 2005, 
Childtime generated LTM sales of $220.7 million across 460 childcare centers in the U.S. (328 of which 
are company owned and 132 of which are franchised locations). On January 11, ABC announced it had 
successfully completed the acquisition of the Learning Care Group, Inc. for $159 million in cash. In 
addition to the 460 centers located in the U.S., ABC operates 707 centers in Australia and New Zealand. 
• Bright Horizons (Public) 
Founded in 1986, Bright Horizons Family Solutions is a leading provider of employer-sponsored child 
care services. Bright Horizons operates 616 childcare and early education centers for over 600 clients. 
The company serves more than 66,300 children in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Guam, 
Ireland and the United Kingdom. In September of 2005, the company acquired ChildrensFirst Inc. As of 
December 31, 2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $625 million and $75 million, 
respectively. 
• La Petite Academy (Private) 
La Petite is the third largest operator of for-profit pre-school centers in the U.S., currently serving more 
than 65,000 children in 649 centers located in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The company also 
66 
owns 68 (included in the 649 centers) Montessori schools which cater to K-12 students. LPA's residential 
Academies are typically located in residential, middle-income neighborhoods. As of February 28, 2006, 
the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $411 million and $33 million, respectively. The 
company has been owned by JP Morgan Capital since 1998. 
Nobel Learning Communities (Public) 
Nobel is a for-profit provider of private pay education and services for education entities for the preschool 
through 12th grade market. The company's programs are offered through a network of general education 
preschools, elementary and middle schools, programs for learning challenged students and special 
purpose high schools. Nobel operates 150 schools in 13 states across the U.S. As of December 31, 
2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $166 million and $15 million, respectively. 
Affiliates of the Principals are currently significant shareholders of the company. 
8.3.4 Government's Role in Early Childhood Education 
Approximately 83% of the estimated $54 billion spent on ECE is generated by private and independent 
non-profit services. The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and 
public schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes 
payments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block 
Grant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of 
for-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs. 
The government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of 
early childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government-
operated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by 
states include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and 
referral systems for parents seeking ECE. 
The increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the "No Child Left Behind Act of 
2001," signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment, 
President Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9% 
increase from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion. 
Certain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code 
provides federal income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for 
qualified individuals. 
8.4. The U.S. K-12 Education Market 
A fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school 
quality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental 
educational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools 
(e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance. 
The K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including more than 
90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according 
to the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are 
approximately $500 billion. 
Despite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown 
little progress. According to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32% of eighth-
graders performed below the Basic level in mathematics, and only 29% performed at or above the 
Proficient level. One-third of American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. KUE believes the 
following factors will present significant market opportunities in the coming years for for-profit K-12 
67 
education providers. According to Harris Nesbitt Research, industry experts estimate that the $21.8 
billion in revenues generated by for-profit education providers in 2004 will increase to over $29.7 billion in 
2010, 5.3% annual growth. 2° However, these estimates reflect only spending by institutions on 
educational material and do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational materials, 
which represented roughly an additional $20 billion in 2004.28

report (December 2004). 
Standards and Accountability. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of American students in grades K-
12, parents and lawmakers are demanding increased standards and accountability in schools. This 
demand has focused on establishing guidelines for every school and every subgroup of students and 
then holding the school (and its staff) accountable to students' performance relative to those standards. 
The Company expects continued focus on academic standards, assessments, and accountability in the 
near future. Despite this increased attention on standards and accountability, many parents continue to 
remain concerned with the overall effectiveness of the public school system and are increasingly relying 
on for-profit education providers. 
Charter Schools and Virtual Academies. There has also been a significant rise in the number of charter 
schools in the U.S. in the past decade. Since Minnesota first enacted legislation in 1991, 40 states and 
the District of Columbia have passed charter school legislation. Under the typical charter school statute, 
an identified entity, such as the state, a state university or local school district board of education, is 
authorized to grant a specified number of charters to community groups or non-profit entities to create a 
public charter school. A growing number of charter boards, in turn, contract with private sector 
organizations to manage the schools. In return for a large measure of autonomy from normal public 
school regulation, the charter school is accountable for student academic performance. Currently, the 
Company estimates that there were nearly 2,700 charter schools in operation nationwide, as of January 
2003, with an estimated enrollment of over 685,000 students. Moreover, the federal No Child Left Behind 
Act ("NCLB") recognizes charter schools as a viable alternative for students who want to transfer from 
neighborhood schools that are failing. 
To capitalize upon the increasing number of parents who are willing to educate their children at home and 
still want to be part of the public system, there are a growing number of virtual schools, where much of 
the learning is home-based. Most current charter school legislation either explicitly authorizes virtual 
public schools or does not directly prohibit them. Because virtual schools usually offer a comprehensive 
curriculum, easy-to-use learning and performance evaluation technology assistance and instructional 
materials, the Company believes that a growing number of families will pursue virtual public schools as an 
attractive alternative to traditional schools and a more cost-effective, better organized approach to home 
schooling. The large and scalable platform that exists at k12 is designed to capitalize on this trend as the 
number of charter schools has grown on average nearly 13% annually, while charter school enrollment

Supplementary Education Market. For parents who continue to enroll their children in traditional public 
and private schools, there is a growing demand for supplemental education services. According to the 
U.S. Department of Education, 31% of elementary school children, or more than 10 million students 
nationwide, are enrolled in after-school programs. According to Eduventures, the U.S. supplementary 
education market was estimated to be approximately $8.1 billion in 2003. Additionally, under the No 
Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, some children in poorly performing schools will be eligible for taxpayer-
financed supplemental educational services. These supplemental educational services can be provided 
by state-approved non-profit or for-profit entities as well as private schools and public schools (including 
public charter schools). More parents want to spend educational time with their children, but lack access 
to high quality supplemental material that is effective and integrated into a comprehensive plan that is 
easy for a parent to deliver and manage. 
The virtual school market is a relatively new area within the broader K-12 education market. As a result, 
there is a growing need for a high quality, trusted, national education offering for this demographic. 
Furthermore, parents are seeking much more robust and comprehensive ongoing assessments than is 
currently offered in the public schools, in order to assess their children's progress both on a relative and 
an absolute basis. 
8.5. The International Education Industry 
The leading authority on the worldwide education industry, the United Nations Educational Scientific and 
Cultural Organization ("UNESCO"), estimates that average public expenditures on education across the 
world increased from 4.1% of GNP in 1990 to 4.5% in 2000. In developing countries the increased 
government focus on education is more pronounced as public education expenditures rose to 4.1% in 
2000 from 3.5% in 1990. Based on global gross national income of $48 trillion, KUE estimates that the 
global education market opportunity is greater than $2.4 trillion driven by the following factors: 
• Large population of school-aqed children in parts of the world. The opportunity for pre-K-12 education 
is particularly strong in certain countries with high fertility rates. Examples of such opportunities 
include India, where mothers give birth to an average of 2.78 children. Increases in the population of 
children coupled with an increased awareness of the economic and social benefits of education are 
expected to lead to significant growth in the global ECE market.

• Increased government focus on education. In many countries, per student public spending on 
education represents a larger portion of per capita GDP than in the U.S. For example, in Australia and 
the United Kingdom, the government has subsidized a large portion of ECE. Now, countries such as 
Saudi Arabia are developing similar programs. The opportunity for increased government spending on 
pre-K-12 education is particularly apparent in growing economies such as China and South Korea as 
those countries increase their share of world GDP. 
• Potential opportunities in countries with declining populations. In countries that have had low fertility 
rates for several generations, such as Japan and Italy, there often exists a large family structure 
supporting a single child. KUE believes that this leads to several family members (e.g., both parents 
and grandparents) contributing to a single child's schooling, resulting in higher education expenditures 
per child. In addition, the high cost and limited availability of quality ECE in countries such as Japan 
has been identified as a contributing factor to declining birth rates in the country. 
The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of some of the key markets around the world, which 
KUE views as attractive. These include China, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. 
8.5.1 China: Market Overview 
With a population of 274 million children under a9e 15, and a fertility rate of 1.73, China represents an 
attractive market for early education providers.3u In China, mandatory education starts with primary 
schools, at which most children enroll by age six. Currently, 24 million Chinese children are attending 
kindergarten as a growing middle class and the one-child policy are driving multiple incomes to one child 
and increasing the amount of capital that can be dedicated to education. These socioeconomic factors 
are reflected in the increasing numbers of private kindergartens, which have grown at a rate of 13% over 
the past eight years.31

Schools tend to be concentrated in larger cities with Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao and Guangzhou 
being the largest pre-school markets. Kindergartens are divided into three categories: Bilingual, Foreign 
language and Mandarin. Bilingual kindergartens are typically joint ventures between Chinese and foreign 
entities or owned wholly by Chinese private or public entities. Tuitions for bilingual programs can reach 
$15,000 per year. Foreign language kindergartens are wholly owned foreign schools that recruit only 
foreign students and are typically backed by their embassies. These schools adhere to foreign 
educational standards with Mandarin being taught as a second language. The tuitions of foreign 
language schools range from $10,000 to $22,000 per year. Mandarin kindergartens are typically owned 
by Chinese public entities.

Kindergartens can be set up by the Ministry of Education, private enterprises, universities, communities 
and individuals. While local governments establish the minimum and maximum fees allowed to be 
charged by public kindergartens, private schools are allowed to dictate "reasonable" tuition levels.

• Only accept non•PRC citizens 
• Very high tuition (›US$10,000 per year) 
• Free to use any curriculum 
• Usually affiliated with overseas schools 
• Examples: Shanghai American School, Yew Chung Shanghai

• Public schools with premium facilities and teaching resources 
• Very difficult to enter (usually requires "guanxi") 
• Tuition itself not necessarily high, but "sponsorship fee" can be 
substantial 
• Examples Song Qing Lin Kindergarten, Dong Pang Kindergarten 
• Increasing in numbers over the past few years 
• Mostly run by locals, but foreign participation is on the rise 
• Quality and tuition vary considerably 
• Examples- Elizabeth Kindergarten (local), Victoria Wah Kwong 
Kindergarten (Hong Kong), Kid's Castle (Taiwan) 
• Essentially a public service provided by the government 
• Typically low tuition (<US$5001yr), requiring substantial government 
subsidies 
• Basic facilities and teaching resources 
• Some are closing down or switching into private hands as government 
wants to reduce expenditure 
Saudi Arabia's nationwide public educational system comprises eight universities and more than 24,000 
schools. Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health 
services. The government allocates over 25% of the annual State budget to education. 
According to the Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia prizes education because of its critical importance in 
developing the country's human potential. Education is a central aspect of family and community life. 
Parents are deeply involved in their children's education, and the close links between home and school 
serve to reinforce the structure of the community and the nation. 
The government plans to increase the enrollment of 4 to 6-year-olds to 40% by 2014.32 Additionally, by 
royal decree, education is now required for all 4-year-olds. New labor laws also necessitate that 
companies employing 50 or more women provide daycare centers. Despite this new series of laws, there 
still only exist 1,200 kindergarten schools in Saudi Arabia (42% private and 58% public) to support the 
legislative pronouncements. The Company anticipates that, additional capacity will be needed to meet 
these social objectives. These trends, as noted by the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia have led to 
private education facilities opening all over the Kingdom. 
8.5.3 United Kingdom: Market Overview 
The United Kingdom stands out with consistent rises in its investment in education, not just in absolute 
terms, but also relative to national income: Spending on educational institutions increased from 4.3% of 
GDP in 1990 to 5.5% in 1995 and 5.9% in 2002. From 1995 to 2002, spendin9 and enrollment in primary 
and secondary education has also increased by 36% and 21%, respectively.s3 Additionally, the country 
invests almost twice as much as any other country at the pre-primary level. The rate of participation of 4-

year-olds and under as a percentage of the 3-to-4-year-old population has also increased from 51% in 
1998 to 77% in 2002. 
The U.K. government is focused on the ECE industry and expects to spend $18 billion on child care 
schemes in the near future through "Sure Start", an initiative designed to encourage additional 
participation in high quality childcare through extensive subsidies. The government's intention is to create 
3,500 additional children's centers in un-serviced, low-income communities.

9. KNOWLEDGE UNIVERSE EDUCATION ("KUE") 
KUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world. KUE currently operates in the U.S. and 
is the indirect parent company (87.6% ownerships') of KLC and also a major shareholder (owns 17.9% to 
40.0%35 of equity) of k12. In November 2005, KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its real 
estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (KLC PropCo) and all of its customer contracts and 
operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (KLC OpCo). 
The controlling shareholders of the General Partner are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green 
(collectively the "Principals"). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of 
experience in the education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. 
Steven Green, a former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an 
international industrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, 
housing, consumer products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Principals founded KUE and its 
affiliated companies over the past decade based on their vision of a world where competition for human 
capital is becoming the driving force of economic prosperity. KUE represents the Principals' sole vehicle 
for equity investment opportunities in the early education through secondary school sector going forward. 
The Company has an accomplished and internationally recognized leadership team. Led by the 
Principals, the Company has a prominent management team and advisory board with significant financial 
resources and substantial experience in the fields of education and real estate management. Additionally, 
through its past experiences at KLC, the Company has demonstrated the ability to acquire and integrate 
education assets. The Company's management consists of people with diverse backgrounds in 
operations, corporate finance, real estate, government relations and education. KUE's role will be to 
oversee the portfolio of operating businesses, identify acquisition candidates, hire top level management 
of the operating businesses and help the portfolio companies navigate some of the legislative and 
regulatory matters that exist in K-12 education. These services will be performed for the Company by 
KULG, for which KUE will pay $20.0 million annually to KULG in quarterly installments beginning July 1, 
2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement. See "Related Party Transactions." 
The General Partner plans to have a Board of Directors (the "Board") with representatives from some of 
the countries KUE plans to expand into, public policy experts and independent directors with 
complementary backgrounds. KUE expects to benefit from the breadth and depth of the knowledge, 
experience and expertise of the Board. At the final closing of this offering, at least two members of the 
Board will be Independent Directors. After the Initial Listing of the Units and so long as consistent with 
contractual and licensing obligations, the General Partner will have a majority independent board.

9.2. Note Payable to KULG by KU Education, Inc. 
On January 6, 2005, KU Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of KUE ("KUE Inc.") 
executed a promissory note in favor of KULG, an entity controlled by the Principals, in the amount of 
$200.0 million, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the acquisition of KinderCare by 
KLC. This note has a seven year maturity and accrues interest at the "reference rate" set by Bank of 
America plus 1.25% per annum. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without any premium or 
penalty. As of April 1, 2006, KUE Inc. owes approximately $183.9 million under the note. 
9.3. Term Loan Facility 
On March 29, 2006, Knowledge Universe Education LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("KUE 
LLC"), entered into a six-month $150 million term loan facility with an affiliate of Credit Suisse, one of the 
Agents. The proceeds of the $150 million term loan were used to repay existing debt of KUE LLC to 
entities controlled by Michael Milken. 
The term loan facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KUE LLC's direct and indirect parents and 
the parent guaranty is several. Upon contribution of assets to KUE by KUE LLC, KUE will become a co-
borrower. It is expected that this Term Loan Facility will be repaid with the proceeds of this offering. 
The term loan bears interest at either the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.125% or the base rate 
(generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time), at KUE's option and is 
secured by cash collateral. KUE is permitted to voluntarily prepay the term loan, in whole or in part, 
without premium or penalty, upon the giving of proper notice.

10. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF KLC's 
PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
In January 2005, KLC acquired KinderCare and incurred $540 million of term debt (the "Acquisition Term 
Debt") and $250 million of subordinated bridge debt to finance the acquisition. At the time of the 
KinderCare acquisition, KinderCare had approximately $300 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt 
outstanding (the "KinderCare CMBS Debt"). KLC refinanced the bridge debt in February 2005 with $260 
million of 7-3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the "Notes"). In November 2005, KLC completed 
a transaction (the "Real Estate Transaction") in which KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its 
real estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (collectively, KLC PropCo) and all of its customer 
contracts and operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (collectively, KLC OpCo). 
Management believes that this division represents the best way to analyze the business going forward. 
In connection with the Real Estate Transaction, KLC PropCo entities incurred $650 million of mortgage 
debt, $50 million of senior mezzanine debt and $150 million of junior mezzanine debt, which 
indebtedness is nonrecourse to KLC OpCo, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay the 
Acquisition Term Debt and the KinderCare CMBS Debt, and KLC PropCo leased its owned centers back 
to KLC OpCo. See "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003" in Appendix B, "KLC: Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended 
April 1, 2006" in Appendix C, "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 2006" in Appendix D and Notes 11 and 21 to 
KLC's Financial Statements in Appendix E. 
The discussion below presents the pro forma results of consolidated KLC (KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo) 
as if the KinderCare acquisition and the Real Estate Transaction occurred on January 1, 2004. The pro 
forma results are not adjusted for the costs of operating KLC and KinderCare in parallel for a significant 
portion of 2005, or for restructuring costs incurred in combining the two businesses. These and other 
items are reflected as adjustments to EBITDA in our presentation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. 
Our pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the 
SEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of 
our 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this discussion and 
analysis does not include a comparison of KLC's historical GAAP consolidated operating results or 
segment information that would be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. The presentation 
of non-GAAP information herein does not purport to comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or 
Regulation G of the SEC. For further information see "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003" in 
Appendix B, "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended April 1, 2006" in Appendix C, "KLC: Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 
2006" in Appendix D and the KLC and KinderCare GAAP financial statements in Appendix E. 
The pro forma presentation is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements. Instead, it is 
based on a "ground up" combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital expenditures) 
and internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC's results. The primary 
reasons for the presentation based on internal reports instead of KLC and KinderCare financial 
statements are the different fiscal year ends and expense classifications between KLC and KinderCare. 
The "ground up" analysis presented is consistent with management's view of the business. 
Key Operating Variables 
Net Revenue Trends and Drivers 
75 
The vast majority of KLC's net revenues are derived from center operations. The trends and drivers 
discussed below relate to such center operations. 
KLC derives its net revenues primarily from the tuition it charges for attendance by children at its centers. 
KLC's tuition rates and net revenues can be significantly impacted by the enrollment characteristics at its 
centers. Key factors include (1) geographic location, because KLC can command higher tuition rates in 
certain geographic areas; (2) the age mix of children enrolled, because tuition rates depend on the age of 
the child and are generally higher for younger children; (3) the mix between full- and part-time attendance, 
because KLC charges comparatively higher rates for part-time enrollment and (4) the level of participation 
in government subsidy and discount programs. 
KLC calculates its average weekly tuition rate as the actual tuition charged at centers that are open at the 
calculation date, net of discounts, for a specified time period, divided by average "full-time equivalents," or 
"FTEs" for the related time period. KLC's FTEs are calculated by dividing net revenue by the center's 
undiscounted average pre-school tuition rate. FTEs do not necessarily reflect the actual number of full-
and part-time children enrolled. 
Tuition rates at KLC's centers are typically adjusted once per year to coincide with the back-to-school 
period. KLC typically collects tuition on a weekly basis in advance, the majority of which is paid by 
individual families. KLC provides discounts to government agencies, employees, families with multiple 
enrollments, referral sources and organizations KLC partners with for its employer-sponsored centers. In 
its employer-sponsored centers, tuition may be partly subsidized by such employers. 
Approximately 20% of KLC's net revenues are derived from tuition paid at varying levels of subsidy by 
government agencies. KLC's revenues are therefore affected by changes in the levels of government 
support for education, which are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions and resulting budget 
pressure at federal, state and local governments. 
KLC reports comparable center revenue trends based on the centers (other than the employer-sponsored 
centers operated for a management fee) that were open in both periods. Comparable center net revenues 
do not include revenues generated from centers that have been closed or sold. 
Utilization is a measure of the utilization of center capacity. KLC calculates utilization as the total actual 
child care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential 
child care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total 
licensed capacity) during the related time period. 
In addition to tuition charges, KLC records revenues from fees and other income in a majority of its 
centers. KLC charges a reservation fee, typically at half of the normal tuition charge, for any full week that 
an enrolled child is absent from its centers. KLC also collects registration fees and fees to cover 
educational supplies at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. KLC offers tutorial programs on a 
supplemental fee basis in the majority of our centers in the areas of literacy and reading, foreign 
language, mathematics and music. KLC also offers field trips, predominantly during the summer months, 
for an additional charge. KLC's centers earn other miscellaneous revenue from various sources, including 
management fees related to certain employer-sponsored centers. In addition to its child care operations, 
KLC's subsidiary, KC Distance Learning, sells high school level courses via online and correspondence 
formats and provides related instructional services directly to private students, as well as to cyber and 
traditional schools and school districts. 
Cost of Revenue — Trends and Drivers 
KLC's costs of revenue include the direct costs related to the operations of its centers. Labor related costs 
are the largest component of costs of revenue. KLC's time management and scheduling systems, which 
enable us to adjust staffing levels for peak and reduced attendance periods, allow KLC to manage its 
labor productivity without adversely impacting the quality of services within its centers. 
76 
Other costs recorded at the center level include rent, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation, 
classroom and office supplies, insurance and food. KLC's management believes its large, combined 
nationwide center base gives it the ability to leverage the costs of programs and services, such as 
curriculum development, training programs and other management processes. 
During fiscal year 2005, KLC experienced a reduction in projected claims costs for its self-insurance 
programs. However, management anticipates that premium and claims costs will continue to reflect 
market forces, which are beyond KLC's control. 
The Real Estate Transaction did not affect consolidated rent expense, but resulted in an increase of 
approximately $96.0 million in annual rent expense of KLC OpCo, which is leasing centers from KLC 
PropCo which now has title to substantially all of KLC's owned real property. 
Other Operating Expenses 
KLC's other operating expenses include the costs associated with the field management and corporate 
oversight and support of its centers and restructuring related expenses. Labor related costs are the 
largest component of KLC's general and administrative expenses. 
Seasonality 
New enrollments are generally highest during the traditional fall "back to school" period and after the 
calendar year-end holidays. KLC attempts to focus its marketing efforts to support these periods of high 
reenrollments. Enrollment generally decreases somewhat during the summer months and the calendar 
year-end holidays. 
Results Discussion 
Revenue increased to $1.48 billion in 2005, which represents an increase of $35.6 million over 2004. 
Gross margin was $340.7 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $11.1 
million, or 3.4%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA during the 52 weeks ended 
December 31, 2005, was $238.0 million which was $6.6 million, or 2.9%, above the same period in 2004.

Revenue. During the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, revenue increased $35.6 million, or 2.5%, 
over the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to tuition rate increases, which took effect 
in January 2005 and September 2005, offset by the impact of center closures and a slight decline in 
Utilization. However, during the third quarter of 2005 Utilization levels increased versus the same period 
in 2004, from 59.3% to 60.3%. This positive Utilization trend was repeated in the fourth quarter of 2005 
as levels rose to 59.2% versus 58.9% in the comparable period of 2004. Management believes these 
improvements reflect stronger economic conditions, strong back-to-school enrollments, marketing efforts 
and other management initiatives and programs. ECE revenue increased $24.9 million, or 1.8%, in the 
52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period of 2004. On a same center basis 
(centers opened for more than one year), revenue increased 4.4% from 2004 to 2005.

$340.7 million, or 23.1% as a percentage of sales, compared to $329.6 million, or 22.9% in the prior year. 
Costs of revenue include the following: 
78 
• Salaries, wages and benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits were $734.9 million, or 49.7% as a 
percentage of sales, during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $725.0 million or 
50.3%, for the same period in 2004. 
• Rent Rent increased by $8.0 million to $121.1 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 
2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in rent was largely due to a center sale-
leaseback program conducted by KinderCare during 2004, prior to its acquisition by KLC. Pro forma 
rent does not include $96.3 million of intercompany rent payable by KLC OpCo to KLC PropCo as a 
result of the Real Estate Transaction. 
• Other costs. Other costs include costs directly associated with the centers such as business 
insurance, food, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation and classroom and office supplies. 
Other costs were $281.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $274.4 
million in the same period last year. Other costs were 19.0% of revenue during both years. 
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses, which include costs 
associated with the field and corporate oversight and support of KLC's centers, were $126.0 million during 
the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $126.4 million for the same period in 2004. 
General and administrative expenses included the substantial majority of estimated temporary parallel 
organization costs of $28.1 million and $23.3 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively, as discussed below. 
Adiusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $238.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 
compared to $231.4 million in 2004. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of slightly 
higher revenue and gross margin improvements enhanced by lower general and administrative costs 
before non-cash SAR accruals, net of restructuring charges and parallel organization costs. The table 
summarizes KLC's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in KLC's existing revolving credit 
agreement. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for a discussion of our use of performance measures 
and related limitations.

Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were 
$29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of 
severance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC's former corporate offices at Golden, CO. 
Additional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and 
other charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC's acquisition of 
AER in May 2003. 
Parallel Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and 
infrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of 
maintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the 
KinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to 
salaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at 
corporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to 
$174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005. 
Parallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based 
on the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month 
(January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on 
an annualized run-rate basis). 
Interest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the 
financings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to 
finance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1 
million of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7 
million which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt.

New Centers 	26.4 	32.4 
IT Spending and Other Capex 	9.8 	14.0 
Total Capital Expenditures 	$70.6 	$83.1 
In 2004 and 2005, KLC spent $34.4 million and $36.6 million, respectively on maintenance capital 
expenditures, which includes refurbishment of its existing centers and equipment and supplies 
replacement costs. In addition, KLC spent $9.8 million in 2004 on corporate infrastructure improvements, 
primarily IT spending compared to $14.0 million in 2005. The remainder of KLC's capital expenditures 
was used to expand KLC's center base through both purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment and 
construction of new owned centers.

11. THE OPERATING COMPANY ("KLC OPCO") 
KLC's mission is to provide a quality education to children from birth to college. KLC was formed from the 
combination of KLC and AER which occurred in May 2003 and the subsequent acquisition of KinderCare 
in January of 2005. Based in Portland, Oregon, KLC consists of (i) KLC OpCo, a collection of operating 
companies and (ii) KLC PropCo, a collection of special purpose subsidiaries owning substantially all of 
KLC's real estate. 
11.1. KLC OpCo 
KLC OpCo is the largest for-profit provider of ECE and care services in the U.S., the second largest 
provider of employer-sponsored ECE to the corporate segment in the U.S. and the largest for-profit 
provider of before and after school programs in the U.S. Through one of its subsidiaries, KLC OpCo also 
operates accredited high school distance learning programs that have served over 200,000 students 
since 1975. On a pro forma basis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo generated 
revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,477.7 million and $149.9 million, respectively.

11.2. Early Childhood Education Unit (96% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 
Revenue) 
As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo provided ECE services through its 1,812 company-operated 
community centers (90% of pro forma revenue) and 122 employer-sponsored centers (6% of pro forma 
revenue). In total the ECE Unit operated 1,934 centers in 39 states and Washington D.C., offering ECE 
programs primarily for children aged six weeks to five years. The programs are marketed primarily under 
the KinderCare, Children's World, Children's Discovery Centers, Knowledge Beginnings and Mulberry 
Child Care & Preschool brand names. 
KLC OpCo's centers typically contain classrooms, recreational areas, kitchens and bathroom facilities. 
The centers usually accommodate the grouping of children according to age. The centers have outdoor 
playgrounds, often with separate areas designed for infants and toddlers, with the exception of some 
downtown urban centers that may utilize nearby parks. Each center is equipped with a variety of audio 
and visual aids, educational supplies, games, toys and indoor and outdoor play equipment. In addition, 
most of the centers are equipped with personal computers with programs specifically designed for both 
pre-school and school-age children. The typical center can serve between 120-140 students, although 
actual enrollments can be higher as some children are enrolled on a part-time basis. Children are usually 
enrolled on a weekly basis for either full-day or half-day sessions. Most centers provide enrolled children 
with meals and two snacks. 
82 
KLC OpCo provides a wide range of quality programs that are continuously updated to reflect current 
thinking and to meet the needs of individual children. Programs have been developed in conjunction with 
nationally recognized experts in ECE and various curricula reflect the latest research in brain 
development. Programs stimulate the social, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of children and 
each program is age appropriate. 
KLC OpCo's ECE facilities are generally open throughout the year, usually five days a week, from 6:30 
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. New enrollments are most often highest in September and January, with the largest 
decrease in enrollment during holiday periods and summer months. Many centers offer summer day 
camp programs for children up to the age of 12. Additionally, many centers offer "back-up" care, which is 
offered in the event that the parent's primary child care arrangement is unavailable (e.g., when an in-
home provider goes on vacation). The company will provide short-term child care until the parent's child 
care resumes. 
Community Centers 
The 1,812 community centers are located in diverse demographic locations. Newly built centers tend to 
be located in the targeted demographic market of newer upper-middle class to upper income suburban 
areas with high concentrations of dual income families. In a community center, the current weekly tuition 
rates for full-day service range from $90 to $400 per child, depending upon the center location and the 
age of the child. KLC OpCo also offers tutorial programs in areas such as literacy, reading, foreign 
languages and mathematics in many of its centers for a supplemental fee and is exploring offering 
additional supplemental fee programs. Tuition is generally paid in advance on a weekly basis and, to a 
lesser extent, on a monthly basis. The company typically sets tuition for half-day programs at a 20% to 
40% premium compared with an equal number of hours for a full-day program. Approximately 20% of 
tuition is paid under state and federal subsidy programs. 
Employer-Sponsored Centers 
As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo operated 122 corporate or employer-sponsored centers. 
These centers are typically free-standing, and are located at or near the premises or campus of the 
employer-sponsor. These sites are different from community centers in that they usually have more 
square footage per child and larger staff areas. Generally, the corporate sponsor provides the 
constructed building. KLC OpCo currently has relationships with a diverse group of employers, including 
hospitals, health care facilities, government agencies, and private sector companies. Its corporate 
relationships include, but are not limited to, the following: AOL Time Warner, TRW, Lockheed Martin, the 
World Bank Group, Fox, Maytag, Northrop, TJ Maxx, the National Security Agency, the Mayo Clinic and 
Stanford University. 
Employer-sponsored centers are operated either on a fixed-fee basis (31 centers) or on a profit-and-loss 
basis (91 centers). Under the former, KLC OpCo receives a fixed fee per month, typically irrespective of 
occupancy. In these contracts, the Company collects tuition on behalf of the employer sponsor. Under a 
profit-and-loss contract, KLC OpCo collects tuition for its own account, generally with no guaranteed fees 
from the employer. In some cases, its operations are subsidized by the employer, typically in the form of 
tuition subsidies, free or reduced rent, the provision of certain services such as maintenance, landscaping 
and janitorial services or enrollment guarantees. This enables the company to utilize the subsidies for 
improved staff quality and teacher / child ratios. 
Contract terms typically average between one and five years. Normally the management centers are 
reserved for children of the corporations' employees. Some contracts provide for accepting non-
employee children, for which the company can often charge a higher tuition. 
83 
11.3. School Partnerships Unit (3% of Pro Forma EYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) 
Through the School Partnerships Unit, KLC OpCo provides customized before and after school 
educational enrichment and recreational programs for school age and preschool children in partnership 
with elementary schools. KLC OpCo provides these partnership services primarily through 573 sites in 20 
states. Average tuition ranges from $35—$75 per week, payable in advance. Parents account for 94% of 
total tuition received, while state and grant subsidies account for the remaining 6%. 
These before and after school programs are typically conducted in collaboration with public schools and 
located on-site at public school campuses. The success of the programs has led to the development of 
summer camps, remedial programs, and drop-in care. Programs are operated under the Champions 
name. Because each program is relatively small (approximately 40 children per program), operating 
costs associated with running each program are minimal. Little or no capital investment is required and 
the contracting school typically provides on-site space for the program. Contract tenures range from one 
year to evergreen. They often stipulate that KLC pays minimum fees to the elementary schools for use of 
facilities. 
KLC OpCo's November 2004 acquisition of EdSolutions, Inc. ("ESI") provided it entry into the 
Supplemental Education Services ("SES") tutoring business. The SES business is part of the federal No 
Child Left Behind Act's effort to improve the performance of students at failing schools. KLC OpCo 
operates 72 SES sites. ESI is approved to provide SES in 19 states and our plans call for ESI to serve as 
a platform for future growth for KLC. 
11.4. Distance Learning (1% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) 
Through its wholly owned subsidiary, KCDL, KLC OpCo also operates accredited high school distance 
learning programs that have served over 200,000 students since 1975. Based in Portland, Oregon, 
KCDL operates Keystone National High School and iQ Academies. Keystone National High School is 
one of the largest and most experienced accredited high school distance learning programs in the country. 
Keystone is a private, diploma granting school with parents or schools paying for individual courses 
and/or complete curriculum. Keystone served over 14,000 students in 2005 and offers more than 60 
distance learning courses. iQ Academies develops and manages online charter schools. It currently 
operates one school in Wisconsin, is working on the approval process for another charter in California, 
and has plans to begin several more charters in the next 12 months. iQ Academies provides support 
required to launch and operate an online high school including curriculum, instruction, technology, 
marketing and support. Though only 1% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenues, KCDL is highly profitable 
and accounts for almost 2% of KLC OpCo's pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. 
11.5. Business Strategy 
KLC OpCo's strategy is to drive revenue growth and enhance profitability through a combination of the 
following initiatives: 
• Expansion of existing business lines. Management believes that the opportunity exists to significantly 
expand the scope of its existing business lines: 
— Community centers. KLC OpCo has substantial experience in selecting and opening new 
community centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 195 new centers which are 
expected to generate approximately $200 million of gross revenue. 
Employer-sponsored centers. KLC OpCo expects to continue the expansion of its employer-
sponsored centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 124 new centers with gross 
revenue of approximately $120 million. 
54 
• Rationalize centers to improve overall strategy and quality of network Management closely monitors 
underperforming centers and looks to rationalization opportunities which generally lead to improved 
Utilization and higher EBITDA generation. 
— As part of its rationalization, KLC OpCo has identified 50 centers which it intends to close and will 
continue to evaluate underperforming centers. As a result, over the next six years KLC OpCo 
expects to close approximately 250 centers with a decrease in revenues of approximately $120 
million. While the closure of underperforming centers decreases KLC OpCo's revenue, 
rationalization is expected to increase both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins. 
• Strategic acquisitions. The childcare market remains highly fragmented with for-profit chains 
comprising only 5% of the entire market. There are over 386,000 family-owned and operated centers, 
with each providing services to fewer than 13 children. KLC OpCo believes there are many 
opportunities to consolidate some of the family-run centers as well as some of the larger regional 
providers. 
• Offer new products and services. KLC OpCo estimates that it services more than 200,000 families in 
a given year. KLC OpCo's scope of operations makes it ideally positioned to market other products 
and services through its learning centers. KLC OpCo has already sold several additional lines of 
educational products and services at test locations including supplemental phonics, math, Spanish 
and music courses. KLC OpCo believes that product and service lines can be expanded to include 
additional educational and non-educational offerings such as medical insurance and student financing 
programs. 
• Initiation of the Spirit of Service Program. The fundamental assumption of the Spirit of Service 
program is that sales are not separate from service—both are driven by relationships. To that end, the 
Spirit of Service program was designed to promote revenue growth by building a sales-oriented culture 
while increasing customer / parent engagement. Currently, KLC OpCo's management team is working 
with consultants from Cypress Consulting and the Gallup Organization to: 
— Understand and evaluate current practices and expectations regarding sales and service; 
— Provide reliable data to help grow enrollments through a better understanding of families who have 
disenrolled and KLC OpCo's current customers; 
— Develop the sales and coaching skill necessary to support requisite practices and behaviors; and 
____ Institutionalize practices, systems and incentive plans to ensure a sustainable focus and culture 
built around sales and customer service. 
11.6. Sales and Marketing 
Early Childhood Care and Education 
Community Centers. KLC OpCo's target market is middle-class to affluent ($70,000+ household income), 
highly educated parents working or residing near the center. Target parents are white-collar workers and 
are usually dual-income families. KLC looks for sites where it believes the market for its services will 
support tuition rates higher than current average rates. 
Management believes KLC OpCo distinguishes its services by developing and introducing high quality 
curricula and programs that incorporate both learning and enjoyable activities held in a safe and 
child-friendly environment. KLC OpCo markets its services through online channels (including strategic 
click through advertisement placements), as well as traditional methods, such as display advertisements, 
listings in the yellow pages, newspaper advertisements, distribution of flyers at schools and community 
functions, and center open house events. KLC OpCo spends a large portion of its advertising budget 
during the summer months in anticipation of the fall enrollment period, with continued advertising 
throughout the year. The primary source of new enrollments is recommendations from customers in the 
communities in which KLC OpCo operates. Center directors are also involved in the marketing process 
85 
by encouraging parental involvement in the centers through monthly newsletters and reports, 
parent-teacher conferences and parental visits to, and inspections of, the centers. 
Although most of the marketing efforts are performed at the field level, corporate headquarters assists 
centers in developing marketing programs, designing campaigns, preparing marketing brochures, 
strengthening the brand name, identifying strategic partners, and providing advice on ways to advertise 
and market the programs at the local level. In addition, KLC OpCo is actively involved in teaching the 
staff and directors business enhancing skills, such as cost management, local marketing and customer 
relations. 
Employer-Sponsored Centers. Services that KLC OpCo provides to employers include onsite and near-
site center operation, backup care, discount programs, holiday care and consulting services. KLC OpCo 
has dedicated sales personnel focused on expanding its presence in this market. It also markets its 
services through relationships with consultants, attendance and presentations with clients at trade shows, 
networking at conferences and through industry alliances and publications. KLC OpCo responds to 
requests for proposals, referrals from current clients and prospects to targeted mid-market centers for 
transition opportunities through mailings and networking. It also targets Fortune 1000 companies for its 
discount and nationwide backup care services which serve large distributed workforces. 
Marketing to employers or corporate sponsors largely takes place at the corporate level. KLC OpCo 
markets to parents through its employer sponsors and occasionally through contracted resource and 
referral agencies. KLC OpCo is finding that the preferred method is through electronic brochures and 
messages as well as dedicated websites for onsite centers and services. KLC OpCo provides hardcopy 
materials and promotional giveaways primarily through employer-sponsored benefit fairs and events on 
client campuses. The centers engage parents and potential parents through brown bag lunch seminars, 
open houses, and visibility tables in client cafeterias and common areas. 
School Partnerships 
Champions Programs. KLC OpCo positions its Champions school age, preschool and summer programs 
as exciting combinations of learning and fun. It relies primarily on a regional, direct sales force in 
effecting a two tiered sales and marketing approach. The first tier consists of selling the Champions 
service at the appropriate administrative level in the school. This selling generally occurs at the 
superintendent or principal level. Selling to administrators is necessary since the majority of Champions' 
programs rely solely on the use of existing school infrastructure. The- sales and marketing effort in this 
tier involves participation in trade shows, featured articles in trade journals, trade magazine advertising 
and news releases. KLC OpCo believes that these efforts have been successful in heightening brand 
awareness, and as such, has enabled its sales force to gain access to entire districts versus individual 
schools. 
Once a Champions program receives the endorsement of the appropriate decision-maker, the second tier 
of the sales and marketing effort begins, which targets the parents of children attending the sponsor 
school and, in some cases, nearby schools. Marketing is conducted primarily through flyers, open 
houses and school newsletters. 
Supplemental Education Services. The sales and marketing process for SES tutoring involves several 
steps. First, KLC OpCo must seek approval to provide services in a state through a request-for-proposal 
process. This process entails detailed descriptions of the curriculum provided and how it correlates with 
state standards, testing and accountability, the operational model to be provided and company 
background information. Once approval is obtained at the state level, KLC OpCo contacts districts it is 
interested in serving, and requests that it be added to the list of approved providers. At the same time 
that it makes the initial contact with districts, it also contacts local schools, often through such schools' 
SES coordinator, and subsequently with the parents at each school. 
Once KLC OpCo has been approved by the state, district and the schools, it competes with multiple SES 
providers selling to individual parents, who are the ultimate decision makers in terms of selecting a 
86 
provider. Many providers are currently offering incentives to children and families to enroll with them and 
some are offering incentives to schools as well. The key challenge in marketing the SES programs to 
families is offering something that is appropriate and that will add educational value for families while 
enticing the children to participate. KLC OpCo believes there is a much larger number of children eligible 
for services than the number that attend programs and therefore an opportunity exists to improve 
marketing and outreach to families. 
Identifying prospects involves targeting urban areas where there is a cluster of failing schools. Failing 
schools are schools that fail to meet established NCLB requirements for three years in a row. After the 
second year of failure the schools have to offer several services in order to prevent being named a failing 
school. This enables KLC OpCo to project the approximate number of schools that will be considered 
failing in the next school year and help identify states to pursue and markets that warrant further attention. 
KLC OpCo is currently authorized to provide SES in 19 states and has already begun providing SES in 
five of them. KLC OpCo believes the SES business provides an opportunity for growth. 
On August 29, 2006, KLC acquired 100% of the membership interests in Education Station, LLC 
("Education Station") from Catapult Learning LLC ("Catapult"), a subsidiary of Educate, Inc. (together with 
Catapult, "Educate") Education Station is a private provider of supplemental educational services under 
the NCLB and other educational instruction and after school services. The purchase agreement provides 
for an aggregate purchase price of $6.0 million with $3.0 million paid into escrow at closing, and $1.0 
million payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date. The amount in escrow is 
payable to Educate on three specific dates during the period beginning ninety days from the closing date 
and ending on July 31, 2007 upon the renewal by Education Station of certain contracts which were in 
place applicable to the 2005-2006 school year. Also on August 29, 2006, KLC and Educate entered into 
a technology license agreement where Educate granted a license to KLC of certain proprietary software 
used in providing real-time online NCLB services. The term of the license agreement is four years and 
provides for a license fee of $10 million payable in three installments of $3.0 million within 30 days 
following each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date and a final installment of $1 million within 
30 days following the fourth anniversary. KLC believes that the acquisition of Education Station makes it 
the largest for-profit provider of supplemental education services under the NCLB in the U.S. 
Distance Learning 
KLC OpCo markets its distance learning products to two distinct customer groups: the home school 
market and schools. Purchases made into the home school market are driven by web-based marketing 
efforts and trade associations along with a direct mail campaign. Purchases made by schools are 
marketed to counselors and administrators through direct mail and telemarketing efforts. 
11.7. Curriculum 
KLC OpCo believes that it can increase enrollment in its centers by continuing to develop and introduce 
high quality curricula and programs that provide parents with meaningful reasons to choose the centers 
for their children over other alternatives. It has designed research-based, proprietary curricula for age-
specific educational and recreational programs to develop a child's social, intellectual and physical skills 
and distributed curriculum manuals for each age group to its centers. These programs are used as a 
framework, within which individual teachers have flexibility to create daily instruction opportunities that are 
tailored to the needs of each class. 
The curriculum covered by the "Early Foundations" program is carefully designed to support school 
readiness. Activities are developed and implemented based on an expansive, research-based framework 
of educational objectives. These objectives mirror well documented early learning standards. Frequent 
assessment insures both program quality and desirable child outcomes. 
57 
The Early Foundations program focuses on providing individual learning opportunities that are flexible 
and appropriate to each child's development level. KLC OpCo believes that the Early Foundations 
program distinguishes the Company from other child care providers. 
11.8. Management Team and Board of Directors 
KLC OpCo is led by a highly experienced management team comprised of experts in the field of 
education, as well as business professionals. This combination of talent is expected to drive continued 
success of KLC OpCo. These individuals are also supported by a seasoned executive and middle 
management team with average Company tenure of ten years. The following table sets forth KLC OpCo's 
management team and the board of directors of its parent company, KSI. Detailed biographies can be 
found in Appendix A.

11.9. Employees 
As of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo employed approximately 40,000 non-unionized personnel. Of the 
total amount, 39,639 are employed at the field level (including teachers and center staff, center directors, 
facilities and field and regional staff) and 592 are employed at the corporate level. Given the seasonality 
of the child care business and the regulated teacher-student ratio that varies by age with each state, 
approximately 16.5% of the total field personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Teachers and 
teaching assistants, which account for 93% of the total employee pool, are paid on an hourly basis. Most 
of KLC OpCo's remaining employees, including District Managers as well as most corporate staff, are 
salaried. KLC believes that its relations with its employees are good. 
KLC OpCo's management believes that its below-industry average turnover rates are a result of its hiring 
practices and closer involvement in center operations, a focus on treating teachers as educators and not 
just employees, and comprehensive training programs that are designed to ensure that teachers are 
successful. KLC OpCo believes that it has the opportunity to reduce employee turnover further through 
improved recruiting, training and management. 
The following table presents 	a breakdown of employees as of December 31, 2005:

Total 	40,231 
11.10. Accreditation 
KLC OpCo pursues accreditation of its centers by accrediting bodies, primarily the National Association for 
the Education of Young Children (referred to herein as "NAEYC"), the nation's leading child care 
accreditation body. NAEYC accreditation criteria cover a wide range of quantitative and qualitative factors, 
including, among others, faculty qualifications and development, staffing ratios, health and safety and 
physical environment. NAEYC criteria generally are more stringent than state regulatory requirements. As 
of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had 831 or approximately 43% of its total ECE centers that were 
accredited by NAEYC. Of the approximately 117,000 licensed centers in the U.S., approximately 10% 
are accredited by NAEYC. 
Management believes that substantially all of its centers' operations and policies adhere to or are 
substantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation requirements. Since the accreditation process is 
expensive, KLC OpCo intends to seek accreditation only where it believes accreditation will provide 
meaningful local marketing benefits or competitive advantages. 
11.11. Licensing and Government Regulation 
Each early childhood care and education center and most school programs must be licensed under 
applicable state or local licensing laws. Responsibility for licensing and compliance with government 
regulations is at the regional and local level. Licenses are held at the center level or by the school 
program and are typically good for a minimum of one year. Generally, the center or school program will 
89 
reapply for a license on an annual basis, and that process may include a visit from the applicable state 
regulator. Renewal of a license is generally a fairly routine process. 
In addition, each ECE center or school program is subject to a variety of state and local regulations. 
Although these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, governmental agencies generally 
review the safety, staff qualifications, fitness and adequacy of the buildings and equipment; the ratio of 
staff to children; the dietary program; the daily curriculum and compliance with health and transportation 
standards. In most jurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of 
locations. Repeated failures by a location to comply with applicable regulations can subject it to 
sanctions that might include probation or, in more serious cases, suspension or revocation of the center's 
or program's license to operate and could also lead to sanctions against the Company's other centers or 
programs located in the same jurisdiction. In addition, this type of action could lead to negative publicity 
extending beyond that jurisdiction. 
KLC OpCo generally seeks to operate centers and school programs in states with strict regulations in 
order to avoid unexpected expense and market disruption that may be caused by compliance with 
regulations adopted in states that previously lacked such regulations. 
KLC OpCo believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations 
applicable to its business. However, a licensing authority may determine that a particular center or school 
program is in violation of applicable regulations and may take action against that center or program and 
possibly other centers in the same jurisdiction. In addition, there may be unforeseen changes in 
regulations and licensing requirements, such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff 
personnel to enrolled children, which could have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's operations. 
States in which KLC OpCo operates routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing 
requirements and implement changes which may significantly increase its costs to operate in those states. 
The SES programs are operated in substantial compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act, as 
well as applicable state Department of Education regulations that vary from state to state, but generally 
regulate curriculum, staff qualifications, and program quality and effectiveness. KLC OpCo must receive 
approval from each state's Department of Education in order to qualify as an SES provider. The length of 
approval to be an SES provider varies, but is typically from one to five years. Repeated failure by an SES 
provider to comply with regulations or its request for proposal documentation may cause the provider to 
lose its approval. 
Federal regulations and licensing requirements require compliance with minimum standards in order to 
qualify for participation in federal assistance programs. Under the Social Security Act, the U.S. federal 
government has established programs to assist low-income families with early childhood care and 
education expenses. These programs include the Childcare and Development Block Grant and At Risk 
Program. Funding is typically provided through block grants to states and counties, which then 
administer the programs through local agencies. 
The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, referred to as the ADA, and similar state laws prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Compliance with the 
ADA requires that public accommodations reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that 
new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless 
structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance 
with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private 
litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. KLC OpCo has not 
experienced any material adverse impact as a result of these laws. 
Section 21 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), provides for an income 
tax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of certain child care expenses subject to certain maximum limitations. 
The fees paid to KLC OpCo for early childhood care and educational services by eligible taxpayers qualify 
for the tax credit, subject to the limitations of the Code. In addition, Section 45F of the Code provides 
90 
incentives to families and employers to offset costs related to employer-provided child care facilities. 
However, these tax incentives are subject to change. 
KLC OpCo is also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum 
wages, overtime compensation and working conditions. All of KLC OpCo's employees are paid at rates 
equal to or higher than the federal minimum wage. 
KLC OpCo is also subject to laws regulating its transportation of children. In 1998, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, issued interpretive letters stating that automobile dealers may no 
longer sell 12 to 15-passenger vans intended to be used for the transportation of children to and from 
school by child care providers and that any vehicle designed to transport 11 persons or more must meet 
federal school bus standards if it is likely to be used significantly to transport children to and from school 
or school-related events. These interpretations and related changes in state and federal transportation 
regulations have affected the type of vehicle that the company may purchase for use in transporting 
children between schools and its centers and, in effect, required KLC OpCo to replace its remaining fleet 
of vans with school buses over time. These changes have increased the company's costs to transport 
children because school buses are more expensive to purchase and maintain and, in some jurisdictions, 
require drivers with commercial licenses. 
11.12. Insurance 
KLC OpCo's insurance program currently includes the following types of policies: workers' compensation, 
commercial general liability, automobile liability, property, excess "umbrella" liability, directors' and 
officers' liability and employment practices liability. These policies provide for a variety of coverages, 
which are subject to various limits, and include substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions. Special 
insurance is sometimes obtained with respect to specific hazards, if deemed appropriate and available at 
a reasonable cost. Claims in excess of, or not included within, KLC's coverage may be asserted or 
coverage may not be available due to insurance company failures or other reasons. 
KLC OpCo maintained either a self-insured retention or a deductible for a portion of its general liability, 
workers' compensation, auto, property and employee medical insurance programs. It purchases stop 
loss coverage in order to mitigate its potential future losses. The nature of these liabilities, which may not 
fully manifest themselves for several years, requires significant judgment. KLC OpCo estimates the 
obligations for liabilities incurred but not yet reported or paid based on available claims data and historical 
trends and experience, as well as future projections of ultimate losses, expenses, premiums and 
administrative costs. While the company believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are 
sufficient, any significant increase in the number of claims and/or costs associated with claims made 
under these programs could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
11.13. Legal Issues 
KLC OpCo does not believe that there are any pending or threatened legal proceedings that, if adversely 
determined, would have a material adverse effect on its business or operations. However, it is subject to 
claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and litigation involving 
allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Although KLC OpCo cannot be assured of the 
ultimate outcome of the allegations, claims or lawsuits of which it is aware, it has not historically had to 
pay any claims exceeding its insurance coverage, and management believes that none of these 
allegations, claims or lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's financial position, operating results or cash flows. In addition, it cannot predict the 
negative impact of publicity that may be associated with any such allegation, claim or lawsuit. 
91 
11.14. Real Estate 
As a result of a November 9, 2005 Real Estate Transaction, substantially all of the real estate owned by 
KLC OpCo was transferred to KLC PropCo. Although the expectation is that newly acquired real estate 
will be owned by KLC PropCo and leased back to KLC OpCo, KLC OpCo continues to be actively 
involved in new center design, development and management. In addition to development of new 
centers, the team is responsible for maintaining existing centers. The real estate group within KLC OpCo 
is headed by Wayne Pipes, Vice President. 
11.15. Environmental 
KLC OpCo is not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could 
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operating results or 
cash flows. It has not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any property. 
However, it has not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of its owned and leased centers. 
Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which it is unaware. 
In addition, future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability, and the 
current environmental condition of the centers may be adversely affected by conditions at locations in the 
vicinity of those centers (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties 
unrelated to the company. 
11.16. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion 
The following summary historical and projected financial data should be read in conjunction with the 
financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of 
Operations" presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" 
elsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and 
Adjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of the acquisition of KinderCare 
in January 2005 and the separation of KLC into KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo in November 2005, as if 
those transactions and related financing had occurred on January 1, 2004. 
KLC OpCo's pro forma results reflect KLC's consolidated pro forma results adjusted to include $96.3 
million of rent expense payable to KLC PropCo. 
Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, 
but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC OpCo's ability to perform as projected 
depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty and actual performance could 
be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in "Risk Factors," particularly the 
risk factor related to projections elsewhere in this Memorandum. Also see "Forward-Looking Statements."

Revenue 
Management projects revenue to increase at a 8.0% CAGR, from $1.6 billion in 2006 to $2.3 billion in 
2011. Most of the projected growth stems from KLC OpCo's ECE segment which currently accounts for 
approximately 96.0% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenue. The following table shows projected revenue by 
business segment: 
93 
KLC OpCo

Sales Growth 
From 2006 to 2011 KLC OpCo projects that revenue from the ECE centers will grow at a 7.2% CAGR. 
The growth forecast is based on the following assumptions: 
. Tuition growth. KLC OpCo projects that tuition rates at existing centers will grow at 
approximately 4% per year for the next five years. This growth is below recent experience 
(6.9% in 2005). Moreover, tuition rates in the industry have been growing at average rates of 
greater than 4%. 
r. Utilization improvement. Management projects that recent improvements witnessed at KLC 
OpCo will continue. By 2011, KLC OpCo projects Utilization will have increased to 65.2%. 
Management believes these improvements in Utilization will be the result of expected 
favorable demographic trends (described elsewhere in this Memorandum), new sales training 
programs, re-branding efforts in selected markets combined with the opening of appropriately 
sized centers. 
. New centers. KLC OpCo expects a net reduction of centers in 2006 and 2007 as it 
completes its integration of KinderCare and the rationalization of its properties. Beginning in 
2008, KLC OpCo projects to be adding net centers.

Additional Products and Services 
KLC OpCo plans to use its footprint of approximately 2,000 centers across the U.S. as a platform to sell 
additional educational (e.g., supplemental phonics, math, Spanish and music courses) and non-
educational (e.g., health insurance, childcare financing) products and services. The sale of additional 
products and services is expected to generate approximately 2.2% of total revenue in 2011, which is 
included in the ECE center projections. 
94 
School Partnerships 
School Partnerships is projected to grow from $48.5 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $138.1 
million in 2011. As a percentage of revenue, School Partnerships accounts for 3.3% of total pro forma 
revenue in 2005, and is projected to grow to 6.0% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in the School 
Partnerships business will be primarily driven by growth in the SES market (more school districts required 
to offer supplemental services), and an increase in the number of parent pay locations in the U.S. 
KC Distance Learning 
KCDL is projected to grow from $10.0 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $41.6 million in 2011. As a 
percentage of revenue, KCDL accounts for 0.7% of total pro forma revenue in 2005, and is projected to 
grow to 1.8% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in this line will predominantly come from the 
expansion of KCDL's direct to family business (which currently accounts for approximately 90% of pro 
forma revenue) and the expansion of states to digital high school courses (which KLC believes it is in a 
position to provide on an outsourced basis). 
Gross Margin 
KLC OpCo's pro forma gross profit is projected to increase from $244.4 million in 2005 to $501.3 million 
in 2011. The growth in gross profit is projected to be largely driven by increased center efficiency as a 
result of improved Utilization, continued tuition increases and the closure of underperforming centers and 
shift in the revenue mix to more profitable business lines (Le., more employer-sponsored centers, KCDL, 
ancillary products and services). KLC OpCo's gross margin is projected to improve from approximately 
16.5% of total revenues in fiscal year 2006 to 21.9% in fiscal year 2011 as a result of these factors. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Due to the relatively fixed nature of KLC OpCo's selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, 
KLC OpCo projects that SG&A will increase at a rate of 4.5% annually after 2006. Additionally, 
management estimates that there will be a one-time increase of $2.0 in SG&A related to the expansion of 
the SES business in 2007. 
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins 
KLC OpCo projects improving pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from $149.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to 
$320.1 million in fiscal year 2011. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve from 10.1% 
in fiscal year 2005 to 14.0% in fiscal year 2011. This projected margin improvement reflects the 
combination of increasing sales and margin improvements outlined above. The table below shows the 
calculation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Long Term Incentive Plan 
Our Adjusted EBITDA projections do not include the effect of any payments that may be made pursuant to 
our Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Under this new plan, which provides performance-based 
incentive compensation awards beginning in 2006 based on our performance against specific Adjusted 
EBITDA targets, we will accrue expenses ranging from $2.6 million in 2006 to $15.2 million in 2011 if our 
Adjusted EBITDA meets the projections set forth in this Memorandum. Each award is payable at the end 
of three years based on performance and subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions). 
The accrued expenses associated with an award in each period are non-cash, subject to cash settlement 
when and if the award for that period is earned at the end of the third year. The actual expenses could be 
higher or lower depending on whether actual Adjusted EBITDA performance exceeds or is less than the 
amounts projected herein. 
Working Capital 
KLC OpCo does not expect revenue or expenses to have a meaningful impact on working capital ratios in 
the future.

Capital Expenditures 
The following table shows the breakdown in KLC OpCo's projected capital expenditures: 
KLC OpCo 
($ in millions) 	2006P 	2007P 	2008P 	2009P 	2010P 	2011P

Total Capital Expenditures 	$69.9 	$60.2 	$65.0 	$72.8 	$74.8 	$76.4 
Between 2006 and 2011, KLC OpCo projects to spend between $41 million and $44 million annually on 
maintenance capital expenditures (approximately $22,000 on a per center basis), which includes 
refurbishment of its existing centers and equipment and supplies replacement costs. In addition, KLC 
OpCo expects to spend approximately $19 million in 2006 on corporate infrastructure improvements, 
primarily IT spending. The remainder of KLC's OpCo capital expenditures is projected to be used to 
expand KLC OpCo's center base. Beginning in 2007 KLC projects that it will only open leased centers; 
KLC OpCo believes that its cost of furnishing each center will be approximately $300,000 per center.

2 Represents total debt less cash. 
11.18. Terms of Revolving Credit Facility 
In November 2005, KLC entered into a revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") with a syndicate of 
financial institutions consisting of a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility under which revolving 
and swingline loans may be made, and letters of credit may be issued in amounts up to $75.0 million. 
The Revolver is used for KLC's working capital and general corporate requirements. At December 31, 
2005, KLC had no revolving loans outstanding and approximately $46.6 million in letters of credit 
outstanding under the Revolver. KLC pays a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum on the undrawn 
portion available under the Revolver and a fee of 1.25% per annum of the daily amount available to be 
drawn under outstanding letters of credit. 
97 
Borrowings under the Revolver will generally bear interest based on a margin over, at KLC OpCo's option, 
either the base rate (generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time) or the 
reserve adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for revolving loans will be 0.25% for base rate loans 
and 1.25% for reserve adjusted LIBOR loans. KLC is permitted to voluntarily prepay principal amounts 
outstanding or reduce commitments under the Revolver at any time, in whole or in part, without premium 
or penalty. 
The Revolver is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KSI and on a joint and several basis by most of 
KLC's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries within KLC OpCo. The Revolver and guarantees are 
secured by first priority security interests in, and liens on, substantially all of KLC OpCo's and the 
guarantors' assets and first priority pledges of all the equity interests owned by KSI in KLC and owned by 
KLC in its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries in KLC OpCo and 66% of the equity interests owned 
by KLC in its non-domestic subsidiaries. 
The revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financings of its 
type (with customary exceptions). The financial covenants include: a minimum fixed charge coverage 
ratio test; a minimum leverage ratio test; a minimum interest coverage ratio test; and a minimum EBITDA 
test. 
Operating covenants limit KLC's and its restricted subsidiaries, and in certain cases, KSI's ability to 
(among others): incur additional debt; incur liens or other encumbrances; make investments; make 
acquisitions; incur certain contingent liabilities; make certain restricted junior payments and other similar 
distributions; enter into mergers, consolidations and similar combinations; sell assets or engage in similar 
transfers; open new learning centers; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback 
transactions; engage in businesses other than those in which KLC and its restricted subsidiaries and KSI 
were engaged at the time of the closing of the Revolver and other related or ancillary businesses; amend 
certain material agreements; prepay subordinated debt; sell or discount receivables; and dispose of any 
equity securities in its subsidiaries. 
11.19. Terms of Senior Subordinated Notes 
In February 2005, KLC sold $260.0 million in aggregate principal amount of PA% Senior Subordinated 
Notes due February 1, 2015 (the "Notes") in connection with the KinderCare acquisition and related 
financing transactions. The Notes bear interest at the rate of VA% per year, payable semi-annually, in 
arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year. 
KLC may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or after February 1, 2010 at certain pre-set 
redemption prices, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. On or prior to February 1, 2010 KLC may 
redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 
the Notes to be redeemed plus an applicable premium. In addition, on or prior to February 1, 2008 KLC 
may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds of one or 
more qualified equity offerings. 
Subject to KLC's right to redeem the Notes, upon a change of control event, holders of the Notes may 
require KLC to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at a purchase price of 101% of their principal 
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
KLC's obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed on a 
senior subordinated basis by most of KLC's domestic restricted subsidiaries within KLC OpCo. 
The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that limit KLC and its restricted subsidiaries' ability 
to, among other things: (a) pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make other restricted payments and 
investments; (b) incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; (c) enter into agreements that restrict KLC 
subsidiaries from paying dividends or other distributions, making loans or otherwise transferring assets to 
95 
KLC or to any other subsidiaries; (d) create liens on assets; (e) engage in transactions with affiliates; (f) 
sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries, except permitted real estate transfers and other 
permitted transfers; and (g) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of KLC's assets and the 
assets of KLC's subsidiaries except permitted real estate transfers and other permitted transfers. 
11.20. Stockholders Agreement of Knowledge Schools, Inc. 
KLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of KSI, and KSI pursues no other businesses independent of holding 
KLC's stock/equity. KSI entered into a Stockholders Agreement on May 9, 2003 with Knowledge 
Universe Learning Corp. (the "KSI Parent") and its minority stockholders (the "Stockholders"). The 
Agreement provides (a) the KSI Parent (and/or any "Parent Entities" designated by the KSI Parent, which 
include the KSI Parent and/or certain of the Principals and certain affiliates of the KSI Parent and the 
Principals) with a right of first refusal over proposed transfers of other Stockholders' shares, subject to 
certain exceptions; (b) Stockholders, to the extent they are accredited investors, with a right to invest in 
new issuances of KSI shares; (c) Stockholders with tag-along rights in connection with a transfer of KSI 
common stock by any of the Parent Entities resulting in the Parent Entities owning less than 60% of KSI 
common stock then outstanding, or a transfer of securities by any of the Parent Entities resulting in the 
Parent Entities owning less than a majority of KSI common stock then outstanding. Stockholders are also 
subject to a drag-along provision, pursuant to which they may be required to sell a pro rata portion of their 
shares in the event of a proposed transfer of a majority of KSI common stock then outstanding. Each 
Stockholder and the KSI Parent are entitled to receive certain financial information from KS]. The 
Agreement terminates upon a public offering of KSI, at the option of the KSI Parent upon a sale of KSI, or 
by written agreement of the parties. Knowledge Universe Learning Corp. was liquidated on October 27, 
2004 and the shares of KSI were distributed on that date to its sole stockholder, KUE Inc.

12. THE REAL ESTATE COMPANY ("KLC PROPCO") 
On November 9, 2005, KLC transferred ownership of 845 ECE centers into wholly owned, bankruptcy 
remote subsidiaries, which are referred to as KLC PropCo. In October 2005, 713 of the centers were 
independently appraised at approximately $1.1 billion.36 KLC PropCo then issued $700 million of CMBS 
debt secured by the 713 appraised centers and the stock of the CMBS borrower, and $150 million of 
junior mezzanine debt, the proceeds of which were used to repay KLC OpCo debt. The table below 
summarizes the revised corporate structure at KLC:

KLC PropCo 
Represents face value; book value is approximately $147.3 million. 
Real Estate Company 
With 845 ECE centers in 37 states (as of December 31, 2005), KLC PropCo believes it is the largest 
private owner of education real estate assets in the world. The real estate portfolio is geographically 
diversified without significant concentrations or ties to any single part of the U.S. KLC PropCo leases its 
centers to KLC OpCo for an aggregate annual rent of $96.3 million. The lease agreement, which was 
signed in November 2005, carries an initial term of 15 years with two extensions available for five years 
each and an escalation of rent by the lesser of 7% or the CPI every fifth year. All of the properties have 
been leased to KLC OpCo on a "triple-net" basis, requiring KLC OpCo to fund all property taxes, 
insurance expenses related to the properties and all maintenance capital expenditures. For the fiscal 
year ended December 31, 2005, KLC PropCo generated pro forma rental revenue of $96.3 million and 
EBITDA of $88.1 million. 
12.1. KLC PropCo Strategy 
KLC PropCo was separated from KLC OpCo to create a flexible vehicle to address the growing 
opportunity in education related real estate. The ongoing need for facility-based education is driving 
increased demand for real estate assets that can accommodate the facilities. 
3° Actual appraisal was for 713 centers and the appraised value was $1.1 billion. The $1.25 billion referred to within this Memorandum is achieved by 
taking the independent appraisal valuation methodology and extrapolating it to the remaining 132 centers. 
100 
• Leverage Greenstreet Real Estate Partners' significant expertise: 
— KLC believes it is able to better maximize the potential of its real estate assets by having them 
managed by a dedicated and highly experienced team at Greenstreet Real Estate Partners rather 
than having them managed at the operating company level. 
• Cash generated will be reinvested in acquiring more assets. 
• Diversify the real estate portfolio: 
— The Greenstreet Real Estate Partners team is actively looking at diversification and reinvestment 
opportunities for the real estate portfolio. The diversification strategy will include some 
opportunistic investments in non-education related real estate assets. 
12.2. Management Team 
KLC PropCo is managed by Greenstreet Real Estate Partners through a long-term agreement. 
Greenstreet Real Estate Partners has a highly experienced management team to guide the continued 
acquisition and diversification of the real estate portfolio. The management team includes Steven Green, 
Chairman and CEO of Greenstreet Real Estate Partners, Jeffrey Safchik, COO and CFO and Steven Cox, 
Executive Vice President Real Estate. Greenstreet Real Estate Partners controls a significant portfolio of 
owned and self-managed real estate and has extensive experience in corporate transactions involving 
owned real estate. Greenstreet Real Estate Partners operates a private real estate equity platform, 
having made in excess of $850 million in acquisitions and with assets currently under management 
(excluding KLC PropCo) of $540 million. It has owned and managed in excess of 10 million square feet 
of shopping centers with value in excess of $1 billion. The principals of Greenstreet Real Estate Partners 
each have in excess of 20 years in real estate and capital markets. Their biographies can be found in 
Appendix A. 
12.3. Description of the Real Estate Assets 
The highly diversified portfolio includes 845 properties in 37 states. The properties are primarily one story 
wood-framed buildings totaling 5,119,320 sq. ft. Some of the larger state concentrations include Texas, 
California, Illinois and Virginia. No single state accounts for more than 11% of the total centers (see the 
Figure below for details on the geographic distribution). The properties are single-tenant stand-alone 
buildings. The average age of the properties is approximately 15 years with 22% of the portfolio built 
after 1991 and approximately 6% of the facilities being constructed prior to 1979. The centers' trailing 12 
month Utilization was 58.9% as of December 31, 2005.

12.4. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion 
The table below shows KLC PropCo pro forma historical results for 2005 assuming the division of KLC 
OpCo and KLC PropCo in the series of transactions completed in November 2005 (the "Real Estate 
Transactions") and related financing, together with the lease of KLC PropCo-owned centers to KLC OpCo, 
occurred on January 1, 2004. Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management 
believes to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC PropCo's 
ability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty 
and actual performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in 
"Risk Factors," particularly the risk factor related to projected financial statements, elsewhere in this 
Memorandum. Also see "Forward Looking Statements."

Rental Revenue 
Management projects rental revenue to increase at a 4.2% CAGR, from $96.3 million (the annual rent 
payable pursuant to its leases with KLC OpCo) in 2006 to $118.0 million in 2011. The growth stems from 
KLC PropCo's reinvestment of excess cash flow in additional real estate and rent increases in the 
properties leased to KLC OpCo as described below: 
Intercompany Rent. KLC PropCo currently leases 847 properties (845 childcare centers) to KLC for a 
total annual rent payment of $96.3 million. The rent on the properties is fixed for the first five years of the 
lease, at which point it increases by the lesser of the CPI growth over the five years or 7%. 
Additional Real Estate. KLC PropCo has projected that it will invest all excess cash (anything over $5.0 
million) in additional real estate. The additional real estate may be comprised of either educational or 
non-educational assets, but will not be leased back to KLC OpCo. KLC PropCo has projected that it will 
invest its capital at an 8.25% cap rate.

1 Represents face value; book value is approximately $147.3 million. 
2 Represents total debt less cash. 
12.6. Terms of the CMBS Debt 
KLC PropCo has $699.4 million of CMBS debt which was arranged in connection with the separation from 
KLC OpCo. KLC PropCo is required to pay interest in cash on a monthly basis at a rate of 5.62% and 
must meet scheduled amortization requirements on a monthly basis and maturing December 1,2015. 
The CMBS debt consists of a $649.5 million mortgage loan and a $50.0 million senior mezzanine loan 
secured by 713 childhood education centers. The CMBS debt is nonrecourse KLC OpCo. 
Each of the centers securing the mortgage loan is leased to KLC OpCo pursuant to a master lease. KLC 
PropCo has entered into asset management agreements with Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly 
Greenstreet Realty Partners, L.P.) pursuant to which Greenstreet Real Estate Partners provides asset 
management and consulting services for these centers to KLC PropCo. KLC PropCo has the right under 
certain circumstances to release, substitute, sell and/or reinvest in properties securing the mortgage loan. 
Prepayment of the CMBS debt is prohibited through January 1, 2007, after which prepayment is permitted 
in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment premium equal to the greater of 1% or an amount obtained 
based on a discount to treasury securities. After June 1, 2015, the CMBS debt may be prepaid in whole 
without premium or penalty. 
The CMBS debt contains provisions that require KLC PropCo to reserve with the lender of the CMBS 
debt 50% of excess cash flow generated from the CMBS centers if EBITDA (as adjusted) for KLC OpCo 
falls below certain levels and 100% if EBITDA (as adjusted) for KLC OpCo falls below certain other levels. 
12.7. Terms of the Junior Mezzanine Debt 
The Junior Mezzanine debt has a face value of $150 million (and was purchased for approximately 
$147.0 million, reflecting a 2% discount to face value), substantially all of which was provided by the 
104 
Principals and their affiliates in connection with the Real Estate Transaction. The Junior Mezzanine debt 
is subordinated to the new CMBS debt. Cash interest is payable on the Junior Mezzanine debt at a rate 
of 15.13% and payable in kind at a rate of 1.50%. The Junior Mezzanine debt matures in May of 2016. 
Interest paid in kind may not be paid in cash until the CMBS debt is paid in full. The Junior Mezzanine 
debt is nonrecourse to KLC OpCo. 
Prepayment of the Junior Mezzanine debt is prohibited through November 9, 2010, after which 
prepayment is permitted in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment premium equal to 8.32% for 
prepayments in the first year, 6.66% for prepayments made in the second year, 4.99% for prepayments 
made in the third year, 3.33% for prepayments made in the fourth year and 1.66% for prepayments made 
in the fifth year. After November 9, 2015, the CMBS debt may be prepaid in whole without premium or 
penalty. 
12.8. Terms of the Master Lease 
As part of the Real Estate Transactions, in November 2005, KLC refinanced its indebtedness and divided 
KUE into KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo, and KLC OpCo entered into a Master Lease with KLC PropCo for 
713 centers. The term of the Master Lease is 15 years and annual rent under the Master Lease is $91 
million per year, subject to increases every five years. The Master Lease is a triple net lease that requires 
KLC OpCo to pay all operational expenses, taxes, utilities, insurance and maintenance costs with respect 
to the leased centers, and the Master Lease may not be terminated by KLC OpCo. KLC OpCo is 
required to make certain deposits or to provide letters of credit for taxes, insurance and maintenance of 
the properties. KLC is also required to deposit rent payments into a segregated deposit account 
controlled by the CMBS debt lenders. KLC OpCo has the right under certain circumstances to release 
and substitute properties under the Master Lease. KLC OpCo has entered into separate, substantially 
smaller leases of KLC PropCo's remaining properties.

13. k12 INC. ("k12") 
k12, headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a curriculum company and management company for 
kindergarten through ninth grade (grades 10-12 currently in development). k12 is the largest operator of 
K-12 virtual schools in the world. k12's mission is to enable delivery of world-class education for students 
in grades K-12, consisting of comprehensive online and offline curriculum that supports numerous 
applications. k12 has invested more than $70 million in building a state-of-the-art curriculum offering, 
integrated assessment and the supporting technology delivery systems. 
13.1. History 
k12 was founded in December 1999, with the goal of leveraging technology to create the highest-quality 
curriculum. k12 launched its first offering in September 2001 for students in grades K-2. This offering 
was launched in conjunction with several of the world's leading education experts and included interactive 
lessons in Language Arts, Math, Science, History, Art and Music. k12 launched grades 3-5 in the fall of 
2002, grades 6 and 7 in the fall of 2003, grade 8 in the fall of 2004 and grade 9 in fall of 2005. k12 has 
continually improved its production process and is now producing courses that are of higher quality and at 
a lower cost per lesson than it originally produced. Building the service in this modular, rolling fashion 
allows k12 to capture students at an early stage and to build out its product offerings in alignment with 
student progress. 
13.2. Current Operations 
k12 provides a world-class education for its students which combines a comprehensive online and offline 
curriculum with integrated assessments and supporting technology delivery systems. k12 currently 
provides its education to grades K-9 through more than 7,000 interactive lessons, and is in the process of 
developing content for grades 10-12. Today, k12 sells its curriculum through the following channels: 
• Virtual public schools (91% of 2006E Revenue) 
— k12 is the largest curriculum and management provider to virtual public schools in the U.S. 
— k12 offers its curriculum directly to the rapidly growing virtual school market (projected to be offered 
to 24,000 students in 2007) 
• District-managed virtual programs (3% of 2006E Revenue) 
— k12 sells the curriculum and technology directly to school districts who mange their own virtual 
schools 
— This is a fairly new initiative for k12 but is expected to be a larger part of total revenue over time 
• School districts for traditional classrooms (3% of 2006E Revenue) 
— k12's science curriculum has been piloted as the science curriculum in various school districts 
including Philadelphia 
— Initial results are promising 
• Direct to consumer (3% of 2006E Revenue) 
— To parents who prefer home-schooling or want to augment or enhance their children's public or 
private school education 
106 
k12 intends to expand the business to international markets and believes there is a significant worldwide 
demand for high-quality online curriculum. In the near-term it can do so by serving multinational 
corporations with large employee bases comprised of expatriates. 
k12 generated $6 million of revenue in 2002, its first year of operations, growing to more than $116.0 
million projected for FYE June 30, 2006. 
13.3. Virtual Schools and District-Managed Virtual Programs (94% 2006E Revenue) 
The past decade has seen an increase in the number of contracts and charters awarded to Education 
Management Organizations ("EMOs"), which manage traditional K-12 public schools on behalf of a school 
district ("contract schools") or manage charter schools either as the charter holder ("charter schools") or 
under contract with the charter holder ("contract charters"). In the early half of the 1990's, EMOs were 
mostly contract schools, managing traditional K-12 schools on behalf of school districts. Later, as public 
money became available to charter schools through the use of vouchers, these organizations moved 
toward charter school management and contract charter management. 
A movement toward alternatives to the public school system is expected to generate substantial growth in 
the for-profit EMO sector. Alternative schools and alternative management programs provide a significant 
opportunity to improve the current educational "product." Furthermore, under the NCLB, growth in public 
school management is expected to continue as schools that fail to achieve "Adequate Yearly Progress" 
("AYP") for four consecutive years are subject to one of the following sanctions: replacement of all or most 
staff including the principal, state takeover of the school, hiring an outside entity to manage the school, or 
becoming a charter school. k12 is well positioned to take advantage of these trends. 
To comply with NCLB, all states submitted a plan to the Department of Education indicating baseline 
achievements for the 2002-03 school year and how 100% "proficiency" would be achieved by 2013-14. 
The law mandates that student progress and achievement be measured ("assessed") by math and 
reading tests that will be given to every child, every year, beginning in the 2005-06 school year. In 
addition, a science assessment will be added beginning with the 2006-07 school year. Under Bush 
administration proposals, by the 2009-10 school year, students will be tested every year from grades 3 to 
11. These assessments are considered intermediate benchmarks that measure a school's ability to 
demonstrate "Adequate Yearly Progress" (AYP) toward meeting its own goals. 
Contract Charters. Charter schools are independent public schools, designed and operated by 
community groups or non-profit entities, but sponsored by designated local or state educational 
organizations that monitor their quality and integrity. In return for a large measure of autonomy and 
freedom from regulation, charter schools are accountable for student academic performance. 
The Center for Education Reform estimates that, in the 2004-05 school year, there were 3,345 charter 
schools serving nearly 894,000 students, representing an estimated 1.6% of total K-12 students. Charter 
schools now operate in 40 states and the District of Columbia, up from 38 in the 2003-04 school year. In 
the 2004-05 school year, enrollment in charter schools represented 1.6% of total K-12 enrollment and 
annual spending on charter schools was $7 million or 1.4% of total spending on all K-12 schools. 
However, in the decade of 1995-2005 the number of charter schools had grown on average nearly 13% 
annually while charter school enrollment increased over 20%, clearly outpacing the less than 1% average 
K-12 enrollment growth over the same period.37 
k12 participates in the charter school business by setting up virtual public schools that it manages through 
a partnership with a non-profit entity. After going through the legislative process at the local or state level 
and obtaining a charter for a school, k12 sets up a non-profit organization with a principal and the right 
administrative team to create the school. k12 then enters into a contract with the non-profit organization

whereby k12 sets up and manages the "virtual public" school. k12 offers an Internet-based curriculum 
(providing the computer hardware and all necessary materials) outside of the conventional brick-and-
mortar setting of traditional public and charter schools. Where legislation has enabled such schools, state 
education dollars pay for children who enroll in them. Virtual schools generally generate substantially 
larger profits than conventional for-profit charter schools because they receive the same amount of per-
student funding as their traditional public school counterparts despite not having to support a physical 
structure. Virtual schools enable students to receive a comprehensive curriculum along with technical 
assistance, teacher involvement, computer equipment, Internet access, and instructional materials, 
without leaving the public education system. Virtual academies are serving a diverse mix of students. 
With the same curriculum, k12 is serving both highly gifted children and children with disabilities. The 
self-paced nature of k12's curriculum and its interactivity allow k12 to serve a broad array of students. 
k12's students, currently in virtual schools, come from public or private schooling backgrounds, as well as 
home schooling backgrounds. A summary of k12's virtual school business is as follows: 
• k12 manages virtual schools for students in grades K-9 in 11 states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, 
Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin) plus the District of 
Columbia. In the 2006 fiscal year, these schools had a combined enrollment of approximately 18,000 
children. 
• k12 managed schools typically produce test score results which exceed or are equal to state averages 
at a cost to the taxpayer that is approximately 70% less than what they would pay for traditional school. 
• Virtual schools are funded primarily through local, state, and federal sources, which k12 expects to 
receive approximately $5,300 per student per school year on average. Therefore, the virtual schools 
provide access to k12's world-class service and curriculum as well as certified teachers at no cost to 
the family. 
• While many of k12's virtual academies are charter schools, k12 has virtual schools that are not charter 
schools but are programs of school districts or other authorized school agencies, such as public 
universities and federal and state agencies. 
District-Managed Schools. k12's district-managed virtual programs operate under the contract schools 
model. Although somewhat similar to the virtual public schools, contract schools are public schools 
operated by private organizations based on management agreements with local school boards. Unlike 
charter schools, contract schools do not require specific statutory authority but are created through a 
contract between a school management company and a school board in accordance with existing 
authority. k12 typically employs the district-managed virtual programs in states where the reimbursement 
rate is low. Two states where k12 currently has district-managed virtual programs are Kansas and Utah. 
The district-managed virtual programs unit is expected to grow revenue from $3 million in FY 2006 to $11 
million in FY 2008. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Education commissioned KPMG Consulting to study virtual education in 
that state. The October 2001 study stated that the Pennsylvania Virtual Charter School (which uses the 
k12 curriculum and management services) 'Was considered to be the highest quality program based on 
the curriculum analysis." k12 believes that the virtual school market has powerful growth prospects which 
are outlined below: 
^ Strong reenrollment rates. k12 benefits from stable demand for its curriculum and services which is 
reflected by current reenrollment rates of approximately 70%. 
^ Increasing existing school enrollment rates. Existing school enrollments continue to increase at 
double digit rates. 
^ Expansion into new states. k12 is currently evaluating opportunities to start new virtual schools in 
several additional states. 
103 
• Grade expansion. k12 continues to expand its curriculum and services and plans to begin 
development of grades 10-12 in the fall of 2006. 
• ADA funding. The level of funding generally increases at approximately 2% per year. 
With four times the number of students of its next competitor, k12 is the largest for-profit manager of 
virtual schools.

13.4. Curriculum to School Districts of Traditional Classrooms (3% 2006E Revenue) 
k12 piloted its core elementary school science program for several school districts, including Philadelphia. 
The initial results of this pilot program were promising. 
Case Study: William H. Hunter Elementary School 
Background. In the Spring of 2004 the School District of Philadelphia wished to give a rebirth to one of its 
lowest performing schools, the William H. Hunter Elementary School. k12 was selected as a partner to 
provide innovative curriculum and professional development to implement a learning environment that 
leverages the latest technology. As part of the k12 implementation, the District outfitted each room with 
high-speed internet access, a ceiling-mounted data projection system, and interactive whiteboards. The 
goal was to have Hunter become one of the District's, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's, first 
web-based public, traditional schools. 
Of Hunter's 600 students, 95% qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program and 25% study 
English as a Second Language (ESL). Therefore, the move and the District's initiative truly marked a 
tremendous opportunity for both Hunter's teachers and students alike. 
Scope of Services. The fall of 2004 marked the official launch of the program and the k12 curriculum was 
provided for all math, science, art and history courses. This included providing all curriculum components 
including text books, teacher guides, manipulatives, equipment, assessments, art supplies and all the 
online lessons and teaching tools for these subjects. 
The Hunter teaching staff did an impressive job of effectively implementing the program. k12 trainers 
worked closely with teachers to adopt the new curriculum and to share best methods on applying the 
technology. Throughout the year, k12 trainers were invited to attend and help present ongoing staff 
trainings. Additionally, grade level teams and school leaders worked regularly with k12 to develop 
coherent plans for boosting student achievement. 
Results / Conclusions: After the first full-year of implementing the k12 program, Hunter achieved 
impressive gains on the state math exams.38 In third grade, there was a 46 percentage point increase (as 
38 The Pennsylvania Department of Education mandates all public schools in the Commonwealth implement its Pennsylvania System of State 
Assessment (PSSA). The PSSA is a standards-based exam for measuring specific skills in math and reading, and beginning in 2006-07 science. 
109 
compared to a 31 point increase for the District). This was a meaningful 86% performing at or above 
proficient compared to the District's 52% for 2005. In fifth grade, there was 22 percentage point gain (as 
compared to a 15 point gain for the District). 
As a result of these scores, the 3rd and 5th grade 
students met or exceeded the absolute AYP 
goals for math instruction - a first for the school. 
(Note: k12 did not supply the Reading curriculum, 
therefore, only Math results are applicable to the 
k12 program). 
These gains are an extraordinary achievement for 
a school and its district. They are also difficult to 
maintain over time, however this goal is shared 
between the District and k12. The Hunter School 
accomplished these gains through the staff's hard 
work, commitment to their students and 
dedication to implementing the k12 program.

New programs often take two to three years to generate similar results. While k12 and the Hunter staff 
are pleased with the first year's results, it is only the beginning of a longer effort because, despite the 
gains, more than half of last year's fifth graders still did not score at or above their grade level. Therefore, 
although there is pride in the progress, the overall scores demonstrate how much more is to be done. 
13.5. Direct to Consumer (3% of 2006E Revenue) 
k12 sells its curriculum direct to consumers who either home school their children or use k12's curriculum 
to supplement their child's education. k12 believes that it offers children and their parents an education 
comparable to that offered in the nation's best public and private schools, utilizing optimal multimedia 
methods and research-tested approaches to learning. In addition, integrated assessments allow a parent 
to test his or her child's mastery of skills and enables the child to progress at the appropriate pace. 
Children can move faster through lessons and address more challenging problems, while other children 
can spend the additional time needed to master certain skills. With k12 's high standards and integrated 
assessments, a parent can be confident that his or her child has mastered the subject. k12 considers this 
market a growth area. 
Educating a child at home full time or part time is a time-consuming and daunting task for parents. 
Parents and caregivers spend a considerable amount of time searching for curriculum and trying to 
ensure they are teaching the material adequately to their children. k12 offers a solution to this challenge 
by offering a comprehensive curriculum for students in grades K-9, complete with specific daily lessons. 
Parents can purchase individual or multiple courses. Although small, the home-schooling market is 
growing at a healthy pace. Approximately 1.1 million students—roughly 2% of total K-12 enrollment—
were home-schooled in spring 2003, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). 
This represents a roughly 30% increase from spring 1999. Most home school parents cited concerns 
about the school environment (31%), interest in providing religious instruction (30%) and overall 
dissatisfaction with academic instruction (16%) as their reasons for home schooling their children.39 
The exam is also used in assessing performance toward No Child Left Behind guidelines for grades 3, 5, 9 and 11. The goal of the exam is for 
students to score at or above proficient levels. Student results are also used to determine a school and district's performance in meeting pre-
determined goals known as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).

13.6. Product Offering 
Comprehensive K-9 Curriculum. k12 offers a comprehensive curriculum for grades K-9 directly to the 
students in its virtual academies, directly to consumers and to school districts, summer schools and after-
school programs. k12 is creating rich and challenging proprietary educational material based on existing 
best-of-breed content and traditional methods enhanced by technology. Unlike most computer-based 
education programs, which rely solely on computers and burden students with mechanical 'point and 
click" exercises, k12 uses the computer as only one among many complementary tools to open children's 
minds to the best books and educational material. k12's math, reading and writing curriculum involve a 
significant amount of off-line work in the form of books, audiotapes, science equipment, art supplies and 
more. k12 provides some of these materials and others will be recommended but not required. 
For example, k12's comprehensive curriculum for students in grades K-9 includes lessons in the following 
subjects: 
• Language Arts. Progresses from a focus in the primary grades on early mastery of reading using 
phonics-based curriculum reviewed and revised by a team of renowned experts, to, in later grades, a 
rich program of literature, composition, and language skills; 
• Math. A solid early foundation in basic math based on a highly respected math curriculum and 
rigorous math standards; 
• History. In grades K-4, a proprietary k12 program that offers a chronological overview of history, from 
the Stone Age to the Space Age, with integrated geography and civics; in middle school, an American 
History survey based on the celebrated History of the US series, and a World History survey based on 
a proprietary k12 textbook; 
• Science. A world-class science curriculum focused on hand-on activities and basic principles driven 
by some of the most ambitious state science standards in the country; 
• Visual Arts. A curriculum that combines appreciation of historical trends and masterpieces with 
specific skill building and many opportunities for creative work; and 
• Music. In the elementary grades, a proprietary program that engages young children in singing, 
dancing and creative movement while introducing them to great works of music from around the world. 
k12's curriculum and assessment are delivered, in part, through a series of proprietary course modules. 
k12 delivers material over the Internet, but also through other forms of media, including traditional books, 
video and learning kits. k12's course modules employ interactive text, audio, videos, CDs, and animated 
graphics. The Internet-based portion of k12's courses contains the following features: 
• Integration of a diverse mix of materials—visual images and concepts, audio, videos and animated 
sequences, as well as high-quality written material; 
• Capabilities for users to see an overview of the whole module at a glance; 
• Opportunity for parents to scan and preview modules before guiding students through work; 
• Integrated assessment services; 
• Ability for children, parents, and teachers to follow students' progress; 
• Comprehensive teaching guides with "drill down" functionality for those parents requiring more detailed 
instruction; and 
• Proven, standards-based, technologies that provide a satisfactory experience for the current Internet 
infrastructure. 
111 
k12 considers the majority of its entire curriculum proprietary, whether k12 is branding existing materials 
with its logo and modifying the associated lesson plans or creating the entire course from scratch. k12's 
K-8 curriculum includes thousands of lessons that consist primarily of existing, high-quality materials that 
k12 has modified to better suit the needs of student, parent and teacher.

The following summary historical financial data and the percentages of expected 2006 revenue presented 
in the headings above are based on historical financial statements. The following projected financial data 
presented below is based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but which are 
inherently uncertain and may not be realized. k12's ability to perform as projected depends on a number 
of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty and actual performance could be adversely affected 
by a number of factors, including those described in "Risk Factors," particularly the risk factor related to 
projections elsewhere in this Memorandum. Also see "Forward-Looking Statements."

Historically, the majority of k12's revenue has been from virtual schools and district-managed virtual 
programs. Traditionally, k12's revenue growth has been driven by three major factors; (i) the addition of 
grades, (ii) the addition of states and (iii) same-store growth in existing states. 
In 2002 k12 began operations in two states (Colorado and Pennsylvania). In 2003 revenue grew to $30.9 
million from $6.7 million during the 2002 fiscal year end. Growth was due to the addition of four new 
states (Ohio, Idaho, California and Arkansas), three new grades and same store sales growth of 
approximately 40%. During 2004 revenue increased by 131.0% to $71.4 million. Revenue growth during 
the 2004 fiscal year was due to the addition of five new states (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin 
and the District of Columbia) and two new grades. During the 2005 fiscal year k12 began to concentrate 
on leveraging its scale to achieve profitability by slowing down curriculum production and not aggressively 
pursuing new states. Revenue grew at a slower rate, but profitability increased as the growth in the 
existing states continued. Existing state growth is more profitable than new state growth because each 
new state requires a significant amount of fixed overhead to be added. 
The projections of financial results presented above are based on the development and expansion of 
k12's operations in existing states and grades. Key growth drivers in the near term are expected to 
include high same-store growth rates and k12's ability to leverage its existing infrastructure for margin 
improvement. Future drivers of growth at k12 which are not included in the projections are expected to 
include the addition of new states. In 2006, k12 opened in Texas, Wyoming and Washington. More 
recently, the Chicago school board approved a virtual public school for the city of Chicago that will be 
managed by k12. k12 also received a charter in the Sacramento area of California that will allow it to 
serve a large area in California that it cannot currently serve. k12 is currently continuing to pursue 
opportunities in several other states. 
Under k12's current revenue recognition policy, revenues are principally earned from contractual 
agreements to provide on-line curriculum, books, materials, computers and to manage and operate virtual 
charter schools. In most contracts, k12 is responsible to the charter schools for all aspects of the 
management of schools, including but not limited to the monitoring of the academic achievement of the 
students, training, and compensation of school personnel; and procurement of curriculum and equipment 
necessary for operations of the schools. The schools receive funding on a per student basis from the 
state in which the charter school or school district is located. Where k12 has determined that they are the 
primary obligor for substantially all expenses under these contracts, k12 records the associated per 
student revenue received by the school from its state funding school district up to the expenses incurred 
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal 
Versus Net as an Agent. k12 has generally agreed to fund any operating losses of the schools in a given 
school year; however, k12 is not entitled to any revenue in excess of expenses incurred on its contracts, 
113 
unless k12 incurred excess losses in prior years. For contracts in which k12 is not the primary obligor, 
k12 records revenue based on its net fees earned per the contractual agreement. 
Under k12's current revenue recognition policy, k12 records revenue related to contracts with its virtual 
academies primarily on a gross basis. As a result, k12 has recorded certain expenses of these virtual 
academies in revenues and costs and expenses. These expenses were $25.4 million and $29.3 million 
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and 2005 respectively. 
13.9. k12 Equity 
k12 has issued and outstanding approximately 45.1 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock, 
approximately 51.5 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock and approximately 10.0 million shares of 
Common Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock is senior to the Series B Preferred Stock and the Common 
Stock and has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (a) two times the original cost of the Series 
C Preferred Stock (plus any accrued dividends) or (b) the amount which would be received upon 
conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock. KUE owns approximately 40.0% of the 
outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. The Series C Preferred Stock has a dividend rate of 10% per 
annum, compounded annually with such dividends being paid in the form of additional shares of Series C 
Preferred Stock. 
The Series B Preferred Stock is senior to the Common Stock and has a liquidation preference equal to 
the greater of (a) two times the original cost of the Series B Preferred Stock or (b) the amount which 
would be received upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock. KUE owns 
approximately 7.5% of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series B Preferred 
Stock do not receive dividends. 
KUE does not own any shares of Common Stock. However, both the Series B Preferred Stock and the 
Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into k12 Common Stock, and on an as-if-converted, fully-diluted 
basis KUE owns approximately 17.9% of k12's Common Stock.

14. THE STRUCTURE OF KUE AND THE GENERAL PARTNER 
The following information is a summary of the principal terms of the organizational documents of KUE and 
the General Partner. The information below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and 
Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General 
Partner, including the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the General 
Partner and the Agreement Among Members of the General Partner (the "Organizational Documents), 
copies of which have been provided or are available upon request In the event of any inconsistency 
between the terms herein and the terms of the Organizational Documents, the Organizational Documents 
shall control. 
14.1. KUE 
KUE is constituted as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership under the Exempted Limited 
Partnership Law (2003 Revision) (the "ELP Law"). A Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership is 
constituted by the signing of the relevant partnership agreement and its registration with the Registrar of 
Exempted Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands. 
Notwithstanding registration, an exempted limited partnership is not a separate legal person distinct from 
its partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any property of the exempted limited partnership shall be held or 
deemed to be held by the general partner, and if more than one then by the general partners jointly upon 
trust, as an asset of the partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Similarly, 
the general partner for and on behalf of the partnership incurs the debts or obligations of the exempted 
limited partnership. Registration under the ELP Law entails that the partnership becomes subject to, and 
the limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability and other benefits of the ELP Law. 
The business of an exempted limited partnership will be conducted by its general partner(s) who will be 
liable for all debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership to the extent the partnership has 
insufficient assets. As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be 
liable for the debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership save (i) as expressed in the 
partnership agreement, 00 if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership's 
business or (Hi) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to Section 14(1) of the ELP Law to return a 
distribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent. 
The Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the 
General Partner to the Limited Partners of KUE (the "Limited Partners," and, together with the General 
Partner, the "Partners") to the full extent of applicable law. The Limited Partnership Agreement also 
restricts the remedies available to the Limited Partners for actions that might otherwise constitute a 
breach of the General Partner's fiduciary duties owed to the Limited Partners. By purchasing Units, 
Investors are treated as having consented to various actions contemplated in the Limited Partnership 
Agreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary or other 
duties under applicable Cayman law. 
14.2. The General Partner 
The General Partner is incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability 
under the Companies Law (2004 Revision) (the "Companies Law"). The Memorandum and Articles of 
Association comprise the constitution of General Partner. The principal business purpose of the General 
Partner is to act as the general partner of KUE, to own interests in KUE and to engage in activities related 
thereto (the "Business Purpose"). The General Partner will not engage in material activities (including 
holding any material assets or incurring any material liabilities) unrelated to the Business Purpose. The 
General Partner has no prior operating history or prior business and will not have any substantial assets or 
115 
liabilities other than in connection with its acting as general partner of KUE and as described in this 
Memorandum. 
The day to day business of the General Partner will be generally be conducted by its directors, although 
certain matters require the approval of its shareholders pursuant to the Companies Law and the General 
Partner's Articles of Association. Under Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is 
obliged to comply with a number of duties, breach of which may, in certain circumstances, result in 
personal liability on the part of the director. However, provided a director complies with the fiduciary 
duties and the requisite duties of care, diligence and skill, the fact that a decision turns out to be wrong, 
not beneficial, or causes loss, will not of itself necessarily establish personal liability. 
As a general rule, in the absence of a contractual arrangement to the contrary, the liability of a 
shareholder of a Cayman Islands exempted company which has been incorporated with limited liability is 
limited to the amount from time to time unpaid in respect of the par value of, together with the share 
premium payable on, the shares he holds; the company having a separate legal personality from that of 
its shareholders, and being separately liable for its own debts due to third parties. However, although 
there is no decided Cayman Islands authority on the issue, English common law authority (which would 
be regarded as persuasive, though technically not binding, in the courts of the Cayman Islands), supports 
the proposition that it in exceptional circumstances it is conceivable that the principle of the separate legal 
personality of a company could be ignored and the court will "pierce the corporate veil." Examples might 
be a company acting as the agent or nominee of its shareholder, incorporation for an illegal or improper 
purpose, using a company or group of companies as a means of perpetrating a fraud, or using the 
separate personality of a company to circumvent a pre-existing obligation of its proprietor. 
14.3. Classes of Units; Capital Contributions 
Assuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends 
on the preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, approximately 2,530,000 Units will be outstanding. 
The Investors will own approximately 40% of KUE in the form of Common LP Units and approximately 
40% of the General Partner in the form of Class A Shares. 
The General Partner will be the sole general partner of KUE and will hold approximately 1,000 General 
Partner Units ("GP Units") in KUE, representing approximately 0.04% ownership in KUE. 
The economic interest in KUE represented by the Common LP Units and the GP Units will be reduced by 
the Profits Participation LP Units as described below under "Distributions." 
Assuming that 1,000,000 Units are sold to Investors by March 31, 2007, and that the accrued dividends 
on the preferred limited partner units are paid in cash, KUE LLC, controlled by the Principals, will hold 
approximately 1,530,000 Common LP Units representing approximately 60% ownership in KUE and 
1,530,000 Class A Shares. The Common LP Units owned by KUE LLC will not be transferable, except (i) 
to the Principals; (ii) to affiliates of the Principals and/or (Hi) to family members and/or charitable 
organizations in connection with the Principals' estate planning unless combined with the corresponding 
percentage of Class A Shares to form Units and transferred in the form of Units in accordance with the 
Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Knowledge Universe Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("KUH LLC") controlled by the 
Principals, will hold 900 Class B ordinary shares of the General Partner (the "Class B Shares"). The 
Class B Shares held by the Principals and their affiliates will not be transferable, except to (i) the 
Principals; (ii) to the affiliates of the Principals; and/or (Hi) to family members and/or charitable 
organizations in connection with the Principals' estate planning. The Class B Shares will automatically 
convert to Class A Shares if the Principals' aggregate direct and indirect economic interest in KUE is less 
than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units (as defined below) of KUE. 
A limited liability company ("KULG LLC-1"), of which Knowledge Universe Learning Group LLC, a 
Delaware limited liability company that is controlled by the Principals ("KULG"), and certain other persons 
116 
designated by KULG are members, will be the holder of the Profits Participation LP Units (the "Profits 
Participation Limited Partner") with the economic rights as set forth in "— Distributions" below. KULG LLC-
1 will undertake that no more than 9% of the KUE Partnership Interests outstanding immediately after the 
final closing of the offering or thereafter will be held directly or indirectly by or for the account of the 
Principals and their Affiliates through the Profits Participation LP Units of KUE. At least 2/11ths of the 
Profits Participation LP Units outstanding will be issued to or reserved for the benefit of members of 
KULG LLC-1 that are not the Principals or their affiliates, and may include employees, officers, directors, 
consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries and joint ventures as designated by KULG. At each 
closing of any sale of Units to Investors where the aggregate purchase price of all Units acquired by 
Investors to date is less than or equal to $1.5 billion (during the Offering Period or thereafter), the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner will be issued a number of Profits Participation LP Units such that the 
aggregate shall equal at least 9/11ths of the 11% of "Partnership Units" (Common LP Units, GP Units, 
and Profits Participation LP Units) that may be represented by Profits Participation LP Units. Additional 
Profits Participation LP Units will be issued to the Profits Participation Limited Partner, at such time and in 
such numbers as the Profits Participation Limited Partner will direct, based upon the issuance by the 
Profit Participation Limited Partner of interests to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner 
(who may include employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries and joint 
ventures as designated by KULG other than the Principals and their affiliates), the vesting schedule of 
such interests, and whether certain tax elections are made by the recipients of such interests; provided, 
however, the total number of Profits Participation LP Units shall not exceed a number equal to eleven 
percent (11%) of the aggregate number of Partnership Units. Any increase in the number of Profits 
Participation LP Units following the sale of the first $1.5 billion of Common LP Units to Investors requires 
a majority vote of the Independent Committee. 
Subsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may raise additional capital through the sale of equity 
or debt securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner units outstanding upon completion of 
this offering but KUE may issue limited partner units with preferences over the Common LP Units in the 
future and may amend the Limited Partnership Agreement accordingly. 
Since the General Partner will have a nominal economic interest in KUE, the Class A Shares are 
expected to have nominal economic value. The Class A Shares are, however, intended to provide Unit 
holders with certain voting and other governance rights in the General Partner (as described further below) 
which, in turn, will control KUE. 
14.4. Admission of Partners to KUE 
The General Partner may admit one or more Persons as additional Partners of KUE on such terms as the 
General Partner will determine. Upon the admission of additional Partners, the capital accounts of the 
Partners will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, to reflect the gross asset values of KUE's 
assets pursuant to Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g). The amount of any such increase or decrease 
will be allocated among the Partners who were Partners immediately prior to the admission of additional 
Partners as if such increase or decrease constituted income or loss, respectively, in accordance with the 
allocation provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Not in limitation of the foregoing, Investors admitted during the Offering Period after the first closing of this 
offering and after September 30, 2006 will pay an additional amount accruing at a rate of 0.67% per 
month calculated from the first closing date of the offering (pro-rated for partial periods) for each Common 
LP Units purchased, which will be distributed promptly to the holders of Common LP Units outstanding 
prior to such admission in proportion to the number of Common LP Units held by such holders. 
117 
14.5. Management of KUE and the General Partner; Voting Rights 
The General Partner will manage and operate KUE. Investors will have no voting rights on matters 
affecting KUE business with respect to their Common LP Units in KUE because the Investors will be 
limited partners of KUE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the 
paragraph below, KUE must obtain the consent of (a) the holders of a majority of the Common LP Units 
unaffiliated with the Principals to amend the Limited Partnership Agreement in a manner that is adverse 
to the Common LP Unit holders and (b) the holders of at least 90% of the Common LP Units unaffiliated 
with the Principals to amend the "Equal Merger Consideration Provision" described herein. In addition, 
the General Partner may not take any action to (a) alter or add to its Articles or (b) alter or add to its 
Memorandum with respect to any objects, powers or other matters specified therein that would adversely 
affect the rights of holders of Class A Shares without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of 
the Class A Shares. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner, acting reasonably and in good faith, may amend the 
Limited Partnership Agreement without the consent of any Limited Partner (a) to correct any 
typographical or similar ministerial errors; (b) to delete or add any provision required to be so deleted or 
added by applicable law or any government official having jurisdiction over KUE; (c) to cure any mistake 
or ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other 
provision herein; (d) to take such actions as may be necessary Cif any) to ensure that KUE will be treated 
as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (e) to reflect the admission of any additional 
Limited Partner and otherwise to reflect such admission or an additional investment by a Limited Partner 
on the books and records of KUE pursuant to the General Partner's power of attorney; (f) to take such 
actions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that neither of KUE or the General Partner (or any 
subsidiary of the foregoing) will be subject to regulation under ERISA or the Investment Company Act; (g) 
to take such actions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that the General Partner (or any Subsidiary) 
will not be subject to the Investment Advisers Act; (h) to reflect any increase in the number of Profits 
Participation LP Units approved by the Independent Committee and related changes in allocation and 
distribution provision; CO to make changes negotiated with Limited Partners admitted in any subsequent 
closing of the offering, so long as such changes do not, in the good faith determination of the General 
Partner and with the approval of the Independent Committee, adversely affect the rights, obligations and 
economic interests of the existing Limited Partners; and (j) to the extent necessary to give effect to 
partnership interests issued to additional Limited Partners after the Offering Period. The General Partner 
shall provide prompt written notice of any such amendments to the Limited Partners. 
Holders of Class A Shares of the General Partner will have one vote per share. The holders of Class B 
Shares will have, in the aggregate, one more vote than the requisite legal vote required to approve 
particular matters. In addition, Investors will have the right to elect directors to the Board of Directors of 
the General Partner as set forth in "— Board of Directors of the General Partner' below. 
14.6. Board of Directors of the General Partner 
The General Partner will have a Board of Directors initially consisting of up to 13 persons. 
Following the first closing of the offering and prior to the "Initial Listing" (as defined below), the outside 
Investor (including its affiliates) holding the greatest number of shares in the General Partner at the first 
closing of the offering will appoint two directors of the General Partner and the holders of the Class B 
Shares will appoint the remaining Directors. 
Following the initial appointment of the Board, the Board may, in its sole discretion, increase the number 
of directors, including to accommodate investors that invest subsequent to the initial closing of the 
offering of the Units, provided that the outside Investor appointing two directors pursuant to the paragraph 
above shall have the right to appoint additional directors as required to maintain a ratio of such Investors 
designees to total Board members of not less than 2/15ths. 
118 
"Independent Directors" of the Board of Directors of the General Partner shall be individuals who (a) are 
not (i) a Principal, (ii) a family member of a Principal, (iii) an employee of a Principal or any entity 
controlled by one or more of the Principals, and (b) meet the definition of "independent director" set forth 
in Rule 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (as if the General Partner, 
KUE and each of its Subsidiaries were the "listed company") , including any such individuals appointed by 
the Investors who otherwise satisfy the requirements of this definition. 
At the time of the final closing of this offering, the General Partner will have at least two Independent 
Directors. After the Initial Listing and so long as consistent with contractual, listing and licensing 
obligations, a majority of the board of directors of the listed company will be Independent Directors. 
14.7. Initial Listing; Initial Listing Process 
"Initial Listing" means a listing on a recognized international securities exchange with a substantially 
concurrent underwritten offering generating gross proceeds of U.S. $200 million or more. "Initial Listing" 
refers to the Initial Listing of KUE or any successor or any subsidiary of KUE to which substantially all of 
KUE's assets and liabilities have been transferred or are held. 
The General Partner may take and cause KUE to take such actions as the General Partner reasonably 
deems necessary to complete the Initial Listing on the recognized international securities exchange or 
exchanges selected by the General Partner, including without limitation a restructuring or reorganization 
or other transaction or asset transfer between or among KUE and any of its subsidiaries. If the Initial 
Listing involves the listing of shares or other interests of a subsidiary of KUE, in the General Partner's 
discretion, KUE may (i) retain some or all of KUE's interest in such subsidiary not sold in connection with 
the Initial Listing, (ii) distribute some or all of KUE's interest in such subsidiary not sold in connection with 
the Initial Listing to the Partners, (iii) offer Partners the opportunity to exchange their Common LP Units 
and shares of the General Partner for interests in such subsidiary, (iv) require Partners to exchange their 
Common LP Units and shares of the General Partner for interests in such subsidiary, or (v) any 
combination of the foregoing. Each Partner shall cooperate with the General Partner in connection with 
the foregoing, including, without limitation, (i) by providing any necessary approvals from such Partner for 
(a) any merger or consolidation of KUE or a subsidiary then permitted by law into an entity that is eligible 
to effect such Initial Listing and has no other material business, assets or liabilities, or (b) a transfer of all, 
substantially all or a portion of the assets and liabilities of KUE to one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries 
eligible to effect the Initial Listing; (ii) by exchanging such Partner's Common LP Units and shares of the 
General Partner for shares or other interests of the entity to be listed: Op by agreeing to customary "lock-
up" (on terms no more restrictive than KUE LLC or its affiliates or any other Common Limited Partner 
which provides a "lock-up") and other agreements with underwriters; and (iv) by taking such other actions 
as may be reasonably requested by the General Partner, provided that, in connection with such Initial 
Listing, no Partner shall be required to contribute additional capital to KUE or the entity effecting the Initial 
Listing. The economic interests of the Profits Participation Limited Partner shall not be reduced as a result 
of any actions taken to effect the Initial Listing. 
14.8. Mandatory Conversion of Class B Ordinary Shares 
The Class B Shares will automatically convert to Class A Shares if the Principals' aggregate economic 
interest in KUE is less than 15% of the outstanding Partnership Units. 
14.9. Distributions 
Cash and other property may be distributed from KUE after payment of ordinary expenses and all 
amounts currently due on KUE indebtedness, funding capital expenditures of subsidiaries and joint 
venture, funding operating and other expenses of KUE, its subsidiaries and joint ventures and after the 
119 
establishment of reasonably necessary reserves as determined by the General Partner. The General 
Partner will make distributions at such times as determined by the General Partner. 
Distributions will be made in the following priority: 
• First, to the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent 
of their unreturned capital contributions, but in no case may a distribution pursuant to this bullet 
exceed a Partner's positive adjusted capital account balance; 
• Second, pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) in proportion as follows: (a) to the Common Limited 
Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent of their undistributed 
Preferred Returns; and (b) to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in an amount equal to (i) the 
number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, divided by the number of all 
outstanding Units other than Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, multiplied by 
(H) the amount distributed pursuant to Subsection (a) of this bullet, multiplied by (Hi) a fraction to 
be provided by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; provided, however, that the fraction shall 
not exceed 2/11ths (unless the Independent Committee has increased the number of Profits 
Participation LP Units beyond the number initially authorized, in which case the maximum fraction 
authorized for this purpose would be increased appropriately); 
• Third, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in an amount equal to: (a) the number of Units 
held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, divided by the number of all outstanding Units 
other than Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner, multiplied by (b) the amount 
distributed pursuant to Subsection (a) of the above bullet from the inception of KUE, multiplied by 
(c) a number (expressed as a fraction) equal to 1 minus the fraction used in clause (iii) of the prior 
bullet for the same distribution (unless the Independent Committee has increased the number of 
Profits Participation LP Units beyond the number initially authorized, in which case the maximum 
fraction for this purpose would be modified appropriately), less (d) all amounts previously 
distributed to the Profits Participation Limited Partner pursuant to this bullet; and 
• Fourth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the 
General Partner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. 
"Preferred Return" means (as to a Common Limited Partner and the General Partner) an amount equal to 
eight percent (8%) per annum, determined on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, 
for the actual number of days in the period for which the Preferred Return is being determined and be 
cumulative on the capital contributions of such Partners and shall be calculated from the date of such 
Partner's capital contribution; provided however that in the case of Common LP Units issued upon the 
conversion of preferred limited partner units at the initial closing of the offering, that the date of Capital 
Contribution shall be deemed to be the date of the initial closing of the offering solely for purposes of 
calculating the Preferred Return. 
To the extent, at the time of any distribution or income or loss allocation pursuant to the Partnership 
Agreement, the 2/11ths portion of the Profits Participation LP Units has not then been fully allocated by 
KULG LLC-1 to employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint 
ventures, then the distribution or income or loss allocation that would otherwise be attributable to such 
unallocated portion of the Profits Participation LP Units shall be reallocated among the Common Limited 
Partners and the General Partner in proportion to their Units for purposes of such distribution or income 
or loss allocation (including in connection with their Preferred Return). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General Partner the authority 
to override the distribution provisions of the Limitation Partnership Agreement described above in order to 
achieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which is: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital 
Contributions to them; (H) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner to receive 
their Preferred Return while the Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an amount 
equal to a fraction of the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received 
120 
pursuant to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner other 
than the Principals), multiplied by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner 
divided by the number of outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner; (Hi) third, for the Profits Participation Limited Partner to receive an amount equal to a fraction of 
the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant to their Preferred 
Return (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner who are Principals or their 
affiliates), multiplied by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner divided by the 
number of outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; and 
(iv) finally, for all Partners (including the Profits Participation Limited Partner) to share in the profits of the 
Partnership in proportion to the number of Units held by them. 
The General Partner may, in its discretion, when establishing the capital structure of subsidiaries or joint 
ventures, provide for a capital structure which provides for high-vote and low-vote (or non-voting) 
securities with substantially equivalent economic rights intended to correspond to the voting and 
economic structure of KUE (taking into account differences in legal form, such that corporate subsidiaries 
do not have specified distribution or liquidation rights with respect to common stock). Notwithstanding 
any contrary provisions below addressing equal merger consideration, to the extent securities of an entity 
corresponding to the voting structure of KUE are to be distributed to the Partners, the high-vote securities 
shall be distributed to KUE LLC for purposes of maintaining the voting structure subsequent to such 
distribution, as long as the securities otherwise have substantially equivalent economic rights and the 
high-vote securities have mandatory conversion features equivalent to the mandatory conversion features 
of the Class B Shares of the General Partner (as discussed below), it being understood that securities 
with high-voting rights shall not be deemed to have a higher economic value than securities with limited or 
no voting rights solely by reason of the disparity in voting rights. 
14.10. Allocations of Income and Losses 
In general (and subject to certain special tax and regulatory allocations), income and gains of KUE will be 
allocated to the Partners in the following priority: 
• First, to the General Partner in an amount equal to the losses previously allocated to the General 
Partner pursuant to the third bullet in the losses allocation from the inception of KUE, less all 
income previously allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this bullet; 
• Second, to the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the 
extent of the excess of their unreturned capital contributions over their adjusted capital account 
balances; 
• Third, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) in proportion as follows: (a) to the Common Limited 
Partners and the General Partner in proportion to and to the extent of the excess of: (i) the sum of 
their unreturned capital contributions and their undistributed Preferred Returns; over (i) their 
adjusted capital account balances; and (b) to the Profits Participation Limited Partner an amount 
of income such that the amount of Income allocated pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) of this 
bullet are in the same proportions as the distributions pursuant to Subsections (a) and (b) of the 
second bullet of 14.9 above would be in if cash, in the same amount as the income, were being 
distributed pursuant to the second bullet of 14.9 above; 
• Fourth, to the Profits Participation Limited Partner in the amount necessary to ensure, as 
promptly as possible and to the extent feasible, that the cumulative net income of KUE for all 
periods since its inception shall have been allocated to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner, and the General Partner in proportion to the number of Units held 
by each such Partner; and 
121 
• Fifth, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the General 
Partner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner. 
In general (and subject to certain special tax and regulatory allocations), losses and deductions of KUE 
will be allocated to the Partners in the following priority: 
• First, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the General 
Partner in proportion to and to the extent of their positive adjusted capital account balances; 
• Second, to the Common Limited Partners, the Profits Participation Limited Partner, and the 
General Partner in proportion to the number of Units held by each such Partner; and 
• Third, to the General Partner. 
To the extent, at the time of any distribution or income or loss allocation pursuant to the Partnership 
Agreement, the 2/11ths portion of the Profits Participation LP Units has not then been fully allocated by 
KULG LLC-1 to employees, officers, directors, consultants and agents of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint 
ventures, then the distribution or income or loss allocation that would otherwise be attributable to such 
unallocated portion of the Profits Participation LP Units shall be reallocated among the Common Limited 
Partners and the General Partner in proportion to their Units for purposes of such distribution or income 
or loss allocation (including in connection with their Preferred Return). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Limited Partnership Agreement gives the General Partner the authority 
to override the distribution provisions of the Limitation Partnership Agreement described above in order to 
achieve the desired economic arrangement of KUE, which is: (i) first, to return the Partners' Capital 
Contributions to them; (ii) second, for the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner to receive 
their Preferred Return while the Profits Participation Limited Partner concurrently receives an amount 
equal to a fraction of the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received 
pursuant to their Preferred Return (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits 
Participation Limited Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner other 
than the Principals), multiplied by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner 
divided by the number of outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner; (Hi) third, for the Profits Participation Limited Partner to receive an amount equal to a fraction of 
the amount the Common Limited Partners and the General Partner received pursuant to their Preferred 
Return (such fraction to be equal to the portion of the Units held by the Profits Participation Limited 
Partner attributable to members of the Profits Participation Limited Partner who are Principals), multiplied 
by the number of Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner divided by the number of 
outstanding Units other than those Units held by the Profits Participation Limited Partner; and (iv) finally, 
for all Partners (including the Profits Participation Limited Partner) to share in the profits of the 
Partnership in proportion to the number of Units held by them. 
14.11. Tax Distributions 
The General Partner may decide to make a tax distribution from KUE on or before April 1st of any year 
following a taxable year in which net taxable income was allocated to any Partner. If the General Partner 
decides to make a tax distribution, then KUE will distribute cash available for distribution, if any, to those 
Partners receiving an allocation of net taxable income, regardless of whether such net taxable income is 
actually subject to tax. The amount of net taxable income upon which such a tax distribution will be made 
will be based on cumulative calculation of net taxable income and net taxable loss which have been 
allocated to each such Partner from the inception of KUE. Any tax distributions received by a Partner will 
be treated as an advance and will offset against any other distributions such Partner is entitled to receive 
from KUE. 
122 
Certain Partners contributed appreciated property to KUE in exchange for their interests in KUE. Under 
the Limited Partnership Agreement, and in accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury 
regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to KUE 
must be allocated for tax purposes among the Partners in a manner that takes into account the variation 
between the adjusted basis of such property to KUE and its fair market value at the time the property was 
contributed to KUE. As a result of this requirement, it is possible the Partners who contributed 
appreciated property to KUE will be allocated more income and gains, and therefore be entitled to receive 
larger tax distributions under the Limited Partnership Agreement, than Partners who acquired their 
interests in KUE pursuant to this offering. 
14.12. Fixed Overhead Payment 
KUE, and/or one or more of its subsidiaries will pay $20 million annually to KULG in quarterly installments 
beginning July 1, 2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement as an agreed upon payment 
to provide for the reimbursement of expenses and other costs incurred by KULG on behalf of KUE and its 
subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, salaries and bonuses of KULG employees providing services to 
KUE and its subsidiaries, fees and expenses relating to financing transactions and acquisitions, 
professional fees and other administrative expenses). To the extent that the U.S. $2,500,000 fee payable 
pursuant to an existing management services agreement with Knowledge Learning Corporation is paid to 
any person or entity other than a subsidiary of KUE, the amount payable to KULG by KUE will be reduced 
by the amount of such payment to such other person or entity. The $20 million annual fee will terminate 
upon the Initial Listing or the sale of KUE to a person or entity that is not a KUE LLC Entity. 
14.13. Illiquidity Period 
KUE will operate for a period of seven years from the date of the first closing of this offering. If there has 
not been an Initial Listing by the end of seven years from the date of the first closing of this offering, the 
Board of Directors of the General Partner will determine whether to pursue a sale of KUE or an Initial 
Listing (or a dual track process); provided, however, in the event that not less than 75% of the value of 
KUE at that time is represented by shares of securities listed on one or more recognized international 
securities exchanges and such shares have been or will be distributed as soon as reasonably practicable 
thereafter to the Investors and the Investors have received distributions of cash and/or such securities 
valued at amounts equal to or in excess of their original capital contributions, then there will be two 
extensions of one year's duration each (as determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner) 
in order for KUE to complete either an Initial Listing or to have the remaining value of KUE represented by 
shares of securities listed on a recognized international securities exchange and to distribute such shares 
to the Investors. 
If the Board determines to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial Listing or a dual track process), then the 
Principals must determine at such time whether they intend to participate as a potential bidder in the sale 
process. 
If the Principals elect not to participate as a potential bidder in a sale process, then they will not be 
allowed to subsequently elect to participate as a potential bidder unless the sale process does not result 
in a buyer at a price the Independent Committee deems to be "fair." If the sale process results in a 
transaction that the Independent Committee deems to be "fair", the Principals will be required to sell their 
entire stake in KUE (Common LP Units and Profits Participation LP Units on an "as converted" basis) on 
the same terms as the Investors. 
If the Principals elect to participate as a potential bidder in a sale process, then the sale process will be 
managed by the Independent Committee and the Principals will be precluded from participating in Board 
deliberations regarding the sale process. In addition, the Principals will be required to sell their entire 
stake in KUE on the same terms as the Investors to the winning bidder in the event the Principals do not 
submit the most attractive bid. 
123 
In the event that a sale of KUE or an Initial Listing has not occurred within nine years from the date the 
first Investors are admitted to KUE, the Independent Committee shall determine whether to pursue a sale 
of KUE (or an Initial Listing or a dual track process). A majority vote of the Independent Committee on 
this issue shall be binding on the Board of Directors of the General Partner and will require the Board of 
Directors of the General Partner to pursue such action within ninety (90) days. 
14.14. Equal Merger Consideration Provision 
The Principals (through KUE LLC) and the Investors will receive the same consideration per Common LP 
Unit and/or Class A/Class B Shares in connection with a sale, merger, recapitalization, share repurchase, 
dividend, or any other transaction where all holders of Common LP Units or shares in the General Partner 
receive consideration with respect to their Common LP Units or shares, other than with respect to 
corporate restructuring transactions, such as a holding company merger, conversion of KUE from an 
exempted limited partnership to a corporation or other entity, change of domicile, or any other transaction 
that the Independent Committee determines is a "corporate restructuring." In any such corporate 
restructuring transaction, the Principals (through KUE LLC) may receive securities with high-voting rights 
and the Investors may receive securities with limited or no voting rights so long as the consideration 
received by the Principals (through KUE LLC) and the other Partners per Common LP Unit have 
substantially equivalent economic provisions, it being understood that securities with high-voting rights 
shall not be deemed to have a higher economic value than securities with limited or no voting rights solely 
by reason of the disparity in voting rights. 
14.15. Related Party Transactions 
Related party transactions include transactions between (1) any of the Principals or any affiliates or any 
entity controlled by any of the Principals, and (2) KUE or any direct or indirect subsidiary or joint venture 
of KUE involving more than $1 million (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any merger, acquisition, 
asset purchase or similar transaction between KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, on the one hand, 
and any person of which fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or similar voting interests) is 
owned by KUE LLC or its affiliates, on the other hand). Related party transactions do not include (a) any 
transaction solely between or among KUE and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or joint ventures in 
which the Principals do not have any direct or indirect ownership interest (other than as a result of their 
ownership in the General Partner and KUE), (b) reasonable and customary director, advisory board 
member, or consultant compensation and benefits (including, without limitation, retirement, health, stock 
option and other benefit plans) as approved by the Independent Committee, provided that any such 
compensation, benefits and arrangements to the Principals that do not exceed $1 million in the aggregate 
annually shall not be subject to such approval and customary indemnification arrangements, (c) 
transactions and arrangements pursuant to or contemplated by express terms of the Limited Partnership 
Agreement of KUE, including the "Investment in Subsidiaries" and "Co-Invest Right' described below, and 
any payments pursuant thereto, (d) agreements, transactions and arrangements described in "Related 
Party Transactions" in this Private Placement Memorandum (including any indemnification arrangements, 
the Fixed Overhead Payment described above and other arrangements and transactions described 
therein) and any amendment thereto (so long as such amendment is not disadvantageous to the 
Investors as a whole in any material respect) or any transaction contemplated thereby and any payments 
pursuant thereto, and (e) admissions of any affiliate of the Principals to KUE as a Limited Partner on 
terms substantially equivalent to concurrent admissions of persons that are not affiliates of the Principals. 
If the size of the related party transaction is greater than $1 million and equal to or less than $50 million, 
then either (a) the Independent Committee must approve the transaction or (b) the transaction must be 
approved by the holders of a majority of the Common LP Units unaffiliated with the Principals. 
If the size of the related party transaction is greater than $50 million, then the transaction must be 
approved by both (a) the Independent Committee and (b) the holders of a majority of the Common LP 
Units unaffiliated with the Principals. 
124 
14.16. Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures 
The Principals will agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) that KUE will be their exclusive 
vehicle for equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-profit companies engaged primarily in 
the business of pre-K through 12th grade education of children (other than companies in which the 
Principals or their affiliates directly or indirectly owns fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or 
similar voting interests) as of the date of the first closing of the offering, which are LeapFrog Enterprises, 
Inc. and Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.). The Principals will not acquire or make an equity investment 
in such companies unless such acquisition or investment opportunity has been first presented to the 
Independent Committee and subsequently declined by the Independent Committee or initially pursued but 
later abandoned by KUE. For purposes of the foregoing limitation on investment, an equity investment 
shall not include equity securities that are (a) issued in respect of debt securities in connection with a 
restructuring, reorganization, sale or other similar transaction in respect of a company; (b) issued in 
connection with an exchange offer for debt securities; or (c) indirectly owned through a fund or other 
investment vehicle managed by a person other than any Principal or affiliate of a Principal. The Principals 
may co-invest with KUE in such companies, subject to the approval of the Independent Committee and 
the co-investment rights of Investors in the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Not in limitation of any commitments or restrictions the Principals may have entered into, prior to an Initial 
Listing, KUE may not permit any of its subsidiaries or controlled joint ventures (which shall not include, for 
the avoidance of doubt, certain exempt companies contemplated by the above paragraph) to issue or 
grant any equity interests in such subsidiaries or controlled joint ventures to any of the Principals or any of 
their affiliates (other than KUE, its subsidiaries and controlled joint ventures) unless (i) the Independent 
Committee has approved and the Investors who are accredited investors (as such term is defined in 
Regulation D) or otherwise legally eligible to participate are offered the opportunity to participate on the 
same terms as the Principals and their affiliates and in proportion to their economic ownership of KUE or 
(ii) such subsidiary or joint venture of KUE has completed an initial listing on a recognized international 
securities exchange. The foregoing restrictions will not apply to the Principals and/or their affiliates: (a) 
exercising co-investment, purchase or other similar rights in respect of securities of K12 Inc. (including 
warrants and options) held by them on the first closing of this offering and in respect of securities of K12 
Inc. acquired pursuant to co-investment, purchase or other similar rights exercised in accordance with this 
clause (a); (b) receiving securities of K12 Inc. (including warrants and options) as compensation for 
services in their capacity as directors (or advisory board members) of K12 Inc.; or (c) exercising or 
converting any warrants or options (or other securities) held as of the first closing of this offering or 
acquired pursuant to clause (a) or (b). 
The General Partner may offer co-investment opportunities to any person (except for the Principals and 
their affiliates other than KUE's subsidiaries and joint ventures) to invest with KUE or to invest in a 
subsidiary or joint venture of KUE. 
14.17. Transferability 
The Common LP Units and the Class A Shares comprising the Units owned by the Investors will not be 
separately transferable, and the Units are to be transferred as a whole unless otherwise approved by the 
Board of Directors of the General Partner and the Independent Committee. 
Units held by an Investor may not be sold, transferred or assigned without the prior written consent of the 
General Partner, not to be unreasonably withheld. During the first two years after the applicable closing 
of the offering, the General Partner intends to approve transfers of Units to an affiliate of the Investor in 
compliance with applicable law. After such time, the General Partner intends to approve transfers of the 
Units to an affiliate of the Investor or to another Investor (and affiliates thereof), in each case in 
compliance with applicable law. The General Partner also intends to approve transfers pursuant to the 
Tag-Along Right and Drag-Along Right provisions described below. 
125 
Although the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General 
Partner permit the foregoing transfers and the General Partner has agreed with certain investors to 
approve such transfers, applicable Caymans Island law gives the General Partner full discretion to 
approve or disapprove transfers of Units in KUE. Nevertheless, if the General Partner does not approve a 
permitted transfer, the parties seeking to effect such transfer may have a claim against the General 
Partner and KUE. 
14.18. Co-Invest Right 
Prior to the Initial Listing, if KUE proposes to issue for cash any Units or securities convertible into Units, 
then KUE is required to offer to each Investor that is an accredited investor (as such term is defined in 
Regulation D) or is otherwise legally eligible to participate in the offering the right to purchase a pro rata 
portion of such securities. This purchase right does not apply to (i) the first 1.5 million Units (including 
such number of Units issued at the first closing of this offering) issued by KUE to Investors through March 
31, 2007, (ii) any public offering of Units or other securities by KUE; (iii) any issuance of Units in 
connection with a merger, consolidation, transfer of assets or other business combination involving KUE 
(or its subsidiaries or joint ventures); (iv) any issuance of Units pursuant to any unit option plan, restricted 
unit plan or other benefit plan, the terms of which are approved by the General Partner, provided that the 
aggregate amount of all Units issued pursuant to this clause (iv) (which does not include any Profits 
Participation LP Units) shall not exceed 10% of all Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of 
such issuance without the approval of the Independent Committee and shall in no event exceed 20% of 
all Units outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of such issuance; (v) any issuance of Units in 
connection with any loan transaction and/or equipment lease, the terms of which are approved by the 
General Partner; (vi) any issuance of Units pursuant to any transactions, the terms of which are approved 
by the General Partner primarily for the purpose of (a) joint ventures or strategic alliances, (b) 
development, production or distribution of the products or services of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint 
ventures, (c) purchase or licensing of technology, or (d) any other transactions that are primarily for 
purposes other than raising capital, or (vii) any issuance of Units upon conversion or exercise of any Units 
issued in compliance with this co-invest right provision; or (viii) any issuance of Units in connection with 
Unit splits or Unit dividends or reclassifications. 
Prior to the Initial Listing, Investors have substantially equivalent rights with respect to issuances of 
securities by the General Partner (with the additional exemption on the issuance of up to 10,000 
additional Class B Shares to the Principals or any of their Affiliates). 
14.19. Tag-Along Right 
A "Tag-Along Transfer" means a sale or other transfer for economic value of the Common LP Units held 
by KUE LLC and its affiliates (and, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and the 
Independent Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held by 
KUE LLC) to a Person that is not KUE LLC or an affiliate ("KUE LLC Entity"). 
Unless an Initial Listing occurred, a Tag-Along Transfer may not be consummated unless the proposed 
purchaser offers to each Investor the opportunity to include a pro rata portion of such Investor's Units in 
the Tag-Along Transfer (at the same consideration per Unit received by the KUE LLC Entity). If the total 
number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares proposed to be sold to the proposed purchaser 
exceeds the number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares which the proposed purchaser is willing 
to purchase, the number of Units and corresponding Class A Shares to be sold will be reduced pro rata 
based on the total number of Units held by the transferor(s) initiating the Tag-Along Transfer and each 
participating Investor. 
Following the Initial Listing, the tag-along right will continue for certain Investors with respect to transfers 
for value of the Units (or units of the listed entity as the case may be) by the Principals or their affiliates to 
non-affiliates (excluding transfers on a recognized international securities exchange) above the following 
126 
thresholds in one or more transactions: (i) 15% of the Principals' original KUE holdings to any single 
buyer (or affiliates of that buyer) or (ii) 33% of the Principals' original KUE holdings in the aggregate. 
14.20. Drag-Along Right 
A "Drag-Along Transfer' means a sale or other transfer for economic value of a majority of the Common 
LP Units held by KUE LLC or its affiliates (and, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors and 
the Independent Committee of the General Partner, a corresponding percentage of Class A Shares held 
by KUE LLC). Prior to the Initial Listing, in the event of a Drag-Along Transfer of Common LP Units and 
corresponding Class A Shares to a proposed purchaser that is not a KUE LLC Entity (a "Proposed Drag-
Along Transfer"), KUE LLC may require Investors to sell a pro rata portion (based on the percentage of 
Units held by KUE LLC being sold in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer) of their Units and Class A 
Shares in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer to the proposed purchaser on the same terms and 
conditions as KUE LLC in the Proposed Drag-Along Transfer. 
14.21. Additional Listing of Investors' Units 
Beginning any time after six months after the Initial Listing, one or more holders holding an aggregate of 
$100 million of more of the Units (calculated based on the issue price) may request KUE and the General 
Partner to take such action as may be necessary (including regulatory and legal actions) for their Units to 
be freely tradable and not subject to volume restrictions on the international securities exchange on which 
the Initial Listing occurred; provided that no more than one such action may be required in any 12 month 
period and customary cut-back and other provisions will apply in any such listing or underwritten 
transaction, as the case may be. KUE will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such action to 
cover such holders and the securities of any other holders legally eligible to participate in such action. 
14.22. Subsequent Capital Raising Activities 
Subsequent to the completion of this offering, KUE may raise additional capital through the sale of equity 
or debt securities. KUE will not have any preferred limited partner units outstanding upon completion of 
this offering but KUE may issue limited partner units with preferences over the Common LP Units in the 
future and may amend the Limited Partnership Agreement accordingly. 
14.23. Periodic Reporting; Books and Records 
As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year but in no event more than 180 days thereafter, 
each Partner will be sent audited financial statements of KUE for the prior year. These financial 
statements will include: (i) profit and loss statements and (ii) a balance sheet showing KUE's financial 
position as of the end of that fiscal year. KUE will also provide to each Partner on a semi-annual basis a 
report concerning KUE's operations. As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, each 
Partner will be furnished with all information necessary for the preparation of each Partner's U.S. Federal 
income tax return and a copy of KUE's federal, state, and local tax or information returns for the year. 
KUE will maintain at its principal place of business full and complete books and records for KUE including 
the following: (1) a current list of the full name and last known business or residence address of each 
Partner set forth in alphabetical order, together with the capital contribution and share of income and 
losses of each Partner; (2) a copy of the Statement filed under to Section 9 of the ELP Law and all 
amendments thereto; (3) copies of KUE's federal, state, and local income tax returns and reports, if any, 
for the six most recent taxable years, to the extent that such exist; (4) copies of the Limited Partnership 
Agreement and all amendments thereto; and (5) any other information required to be maintained by the 
ELP Law. Upon the request of a Partner, the General Partner will promptly deliver to the requesting 
Partner, at the expense of KUE, a copy of the information listed in the foregoing sentence. 
127 
The General Partner will provide such periodic reports if engaged in any business other than acting as 
General Partner of KUE or if it owns any material assets other than an interest in KUE. 
14.24. Indemnification 
KUE will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the General Partner, and its 
members, officers, directors, and employees, and at the General Partner's discretion, any other person 
providing services to KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures, (Indemnified Persons") from and against loss 
because of any action performed by them on behalf of KUE or of the failure to take any action on behalf of 
KUE, unless such loss resulted from the Indemnified Person acting in bad faith or the willful misconduct, 
fraud or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person, or a material breach of the Limited Partnership 
Agreement by such Indemnified Person. Indemnified persons may receive advances or be reimbursed 
for their expenses. 
14.25. Amendment of the Limited Partnership Agreement 
Generally, the Limited Partnership Agreement may be amended with the consent of the General Partner. 
Subject to the exceptions specified in the Limited Partnership Agreement, amendments adversely 
affecting the Common LP Units may not be effected without a majority of the votes represented by Units 
held by Investors. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner, acting reasonably and in good faith, may amend the 
Limited Partnership Agreement without the consent of any Limited Partner (a) to correct any typographical 
or similar ministerial errors; (b) to delete or add any provision required to be so deleted or added by 
applicable law or any government official having jurisdiction over KUE; (c) to cure any mistake or 
ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other 
provision herein; (d) to take such actions as may be necessary Cif any) to ensure that KUE will be treated 
as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (e) to reflect the admission of any additional 
Limited Partner and otherwise to reflect such admission or an additional investment by a Limited Partner 
on the books and records of KUE pursuant to the General Partner's power of attorney; (f) to take such 
actions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that neither of KUE or the General Partner (or any 
subsidiary of the foregoing) will be subject to regulation under ERISA or the Investment Company Act; (g) 
to take such actions as may be necessary (if any) to ensure that the General Partner (or any Subsidiary) 
will not be subject to the Investment Advisers Act; (h) to reflect any increase in the number of Profits 
Participation LP Units approved by the Independent Committee and related changes in allocation and 
distribution provision; (i) to make changes negotiated with Limited Partners admitted in any subsequent 
closing of the offering, so long as such changes do not, in the good faith determination of the General 
Partner and with the approval of the Independent Committee, adversely affect the rights, obligations and 
economic interests of the existing Limited Partners; and a) to the extent necessary to give effect to 
partnership interests issued to additional Limited Partners after the Offering Period. The General Partner 
shall provide prompt written notice of any such amendments to the Limited Partners. 
14.26. Confidentiality 
Each Investor is subject to an obligation to keep KUE related information confidential, subject to limited 
exceptions. KUE or the General Partner will be entitled to enforce such obligations and take such actions 
to maintain the confidentiality of KUE related information, including without limitation withholding any 
periodic or financial reports (with the approval of the Independent Committee) from an Investor that has 
violated its confidentiality obligations. 
128 
14.27. Jurisdiction 
Any actions or proceedings under the Limited Partnership Agreement or with respect to the General 
Partners or this offering and the related agreements are subject to binding arbitration in London, United 
Kingdom. 
14.28. Limitation of Participation 
Under circumstances where the continuing participation in KUE by an Investor would have a material 
adverse effect on KUE or a subsidiary, the General Partner may cause an Investor's interest in KUE to be 
redeemed or transferred. 
14.29. United States Trade or Business 
The General Partner will use its reasonable best efforts not to cause or allow KUE to engage in or invest 
(other than through an entity that is not a pass-through entity) in a pass-through entity (for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes) that engages in: (i) any commercial activities within the meaning of Section 
892(a)(2) of the Code, or (fi) any activity which constitutes the conduct of a trade or business in the United 
States and generates income which constitutes "effectively connected income" in the hands of a non-U.S. 
Limited Partner. KUE will not take a position in any United States federal or state income tax return that 
KUE is engaged in a trade or business in the United States that causes the non-U.S. Limited Partners to 
have income which constitutes "effectively connected income" in the hands of non-U.S. Limited Partners. 
In addition, the General Partner will use its reasonable best efforts to cause KUE not to invest in a U.S. 
real property interest described in Section 897(c)(1 )(A)(i) or the Code. 
The General Partner may, in its discretion, form a separate investment entity to pursue any investment 
opportunity that is unavailable to KUE by reason of the foregoing, and may offer co-investment 
opportunities to the Partners eligible to participate in such opportunities in proportion to their Units or on 
such other reasonable basis as the General Partner may determine. 
EACH PROSPECTIVE NON-U.S. LIMITED PARTNER SHOULD REVIEW THE SECTION ENTITLED 
"CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES" AND CONSULT ITS TAX AND OTHER ADVISORS IN 
DETERMINING THE POSSIBLE TAX, EXCHANGE CONTROL OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES TO IT 
UNDER THE LAWS OF THE U.S. AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS OF WHICH IT IS A CITIZEN, 
RESIDENT OR DOMICILIARY, IN WHICH IT CONDUCTS BUSINESS OR IN WHICH IT OTHERWISE 
MAY BE SUBJECT TO TAX, OF THE PURCHASE AND OWNERSHIP OF UNITS. 
14.30. Term of KUE; Term of the General Partner 
The term of KUE will be indefinite, unless terminated earlier as provided for below. The term of the 
General Partner will be indefinite, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Organizational 
Documents. 
The following events will cause the dissolution of KUE: 
• The withdrawal, dissolution, bankruptcy, or resignation of a General Partner, unless the business 
of KUE is continued by the election of a new General Partner by the vote of a majority in number 
of the Units held by Common Limited Partners within 90 days of the happening of such event; 
129 
• The agreement of the General Partner and the holders of a majority of the Units held by the 
Limited Partners holding Common LP Units; 
• The sale or distribution of all or substantially all of KUE's assets; or 
• As otherwise provided by law. 
If KUE is dissolved and not reconstituted and continued, the General Partner is then required to wind up 
the affairs of KUE and to liquidate and sell its assets in an orderly manner. Upon the winding up and 
termination of the business and affairs of KUE, its assets (other than cash) will be sold, its liabilities and 
obligations to creditors and all expenses incurred in its liquidation will be paid. The net proceeds from 
such sales (after deducting all selling costs and expenses in connection therewith) and any released 
reserves will then be distributed to the Partners in accordance with "— Distributions" by the later of the end 
of the taxable year of KUE which includes the liquidation date or the 90th day following the liquidation 
date. KUE property will not be distributed in kind to the Partners upon the dissolution and termination of 
KUE unless otherwise agreed by the General Partner.

AGREEMENTS 
Certain key terms of the following incentive plans and employment agreements of the Company, which

are outlined below. Copies of such documentation have been provided or are available upon request and 
the summaries below are qualified in their entirety by reference to such documentation. 
15.1. Long Term Incentive Plan and Agreements of Knowledge Learning Corporation 
Effective as of December 6, 2005, KLC put in place a long term incentive plan ("LTIP") for officers, 
employees or consultants, providing for incentive compensation payments based upon the achievement 
of certain performance criteria determined by KLC's Compensation Committee. Under the terms of the 
long term incentive award agreements entered into with eligible recipients pursuant to the LTIP, if the 
recipient is terminated by KLC without cause after the first year of any 3-year performance cycle, the first 
of which begins in 2006, or upon death, permanent disability or retirement after the first 6 months of any 
performance cycle, the recipient is eligible to receive a pro rata portion of any incentive award earned. 
The recipient is also eligible to receive a pro rata portion of any incentive award earned in the event of a 
sale of KLC or a termination of the LTIP. 
15.2. Profits Interest Grants 
KUE expects to grant profits interests in KUE to its (or its subsidiary's) present and future officers, 
directors, employees and consultants, aggregating up to 2% of KUE's aggregate profits, subject to 
increases approved by the Independent Committee. Such grants would be dilutive to the holders of Units. 
15.3. Stock Appreciation Rights Plan of Knowledge Schools, Inc. 
KSI established a stock appreciation rights ("SAR") plan for directors, officers, employees or consultants 
of KSI and its subsidiaries on April 25, 2004, pursuant to which a maximum number of 18,410 phantom 
shares (which may be converted to options) may be granted and an equivalent of 4,353.860 phantom 
shares are issued and outstanding. SARs may be granted under the plan until April 24, 2014 and shall 
vest and become exercisable as set forth in the holder's SAR agreement. These phantom shares will 
provide the holders with the appreciation in value of the equivalent of 1.6% of KSI's equity (after payment 
of $7.8 million to KLC's departing chief executive officer in settlement of his SARs, and based on 
273,904.89884 shares as of April 28, 2006). Beginning in 2006, incentive compensation at the KLC level 
to management will be made through the LTIP described above, while directors of KSI may continue to be 
granted SAR. 
15.4. Stock Option Grants by Knowledge Schools, Inc. 
Les Biller and Stephen Goldsmith have been granted options to purchase an aggregate of 3,412.6 shares 
of common stock of KSI. Les Biller is on the Advisory Board of KUE and a director of KSI. Stephen

and a director of KS!. KSI may issue similar options from time to time. 
15.5. Employment Agreements 
With one exception, the Company's executives do not have long-term employment agreements. KLC 
entered into an employment agreement with Elanna Yalow as of August 1, 2004 with an employment term 
131 
of three years, unless terminated earlier. She serves as KLC's President and COO with a fixed annual 
base salary of $300,000 plus bonuses, as well as stock appreciation rights. If KLC terminates Ms. 
Yalow's employment at any time, other than for death, disability or cause, KLC is required to pay as 
severance, Ms. Yalow's base compensation for the balance of the severance period. In case of 
termination after expiration of the employment term, KLC is required to pay, in addition to the severance 
pay, unpaid base compensation earned as of the date of termination. 
In connection with employment arrangements for newly hired officers (including Peter Maslen, Derek 
Feng and Kal Raman), the Company is providing equity-based compensation in amounts to be agreed, 
which will be subject to customary terms and conditions. 
15.6. KULG Arrangements 
Certain of the executives providing services to KUE and its subsidiaries are employees and officers of, or 
consultants to, KULG. Stephen Goldsmith, Senior Vice President of KULG, has a three-year employment 
agreement beginning February 1, 2005, terminable at will by KULG or Mr. Goldsmith, subject to 
severance benefits in certain circumstances and death and disability benefits. The agreement provides 
for a $500,000 annual salary and targeted $250,000 discretionary bonus. Nina Rees, Vice President of 
Strategic Initiatives of KULG, has an employment agreement terminable by her or KULG with 90 days' 
notice and providing an annual salary of $180,000 plus a discretionary bonus. Ted Sanders has a 24-
month consulting agreement with KULG beginning March 1, 2005 pursuant to which he receives 
consulting fees at a $25,000 annual rate for the first 12 months and a $35,000 annual rate for the second 
12 months. All of these amounts, together with the compensation of other KULG employees providing 
services to KUE will be paid from the annual overhead expense payment KUE will pay to KULG, as 
described in "Related Party Transactions."

17. ELIGIBLE INVESTORS 
17.1. UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 
The Units will not be registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration 
provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and will not be registered under the securities laws of any 
jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, the Units are initially being offered and sold only to "accredited investors." 
Each investor is required to enter into a Subscription Agreement to purchase the Units. In the 
Subscription Agreement, it will be required to represent, among other customary private placement 
representations, as follows: 
• that it is an "accredited investor" (as such term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities 
Act); 
• that it has carefully read and understood this Memorandum and the organizational documents of 
KUE in their entirety and that it has relied on such documents in making its investment decision; 
• that it has had an opportunity to receive answers from KUE to its questions regarding the Units 
and other matters pertaining to its investment, and it has obtained all additional information it has 
requested from KUE to verify the accuracy of the information furnished to it; 
• that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the Units and of making an 
informed investment decision with respect thereto; 
• that its financial situation is such that it can afford to bear the economic risk of holding the Units 
as an illiquid investment for an indefinite period of time, and it can afford to suffer the complete 
loss of its investment; 
• that it is acquiring the Units for its own account for investment purposes only and not with a view 
to resale or distribution; and 
• that it understands that it must bear the economic risk of an investment in the Units for an 
indefinite period of time. 
In the Subscription Agreement, each investor will be required to represent whether or not it is a U.S. 
Person or non-U.S. Person (as such terms are defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). Each 
non-U.S. Person will be required to represent: 
• whether it is purchasing the Units in an offshore transaction within the meaning of Regulation S; 
and 
• that it is eligible to purchase the Units under the laws applicable to it. 
136 
A copy of the form of the Subscription Agreement will be provided. Each investor should carefully read 
the Subscription Agreement in its entirety so as to fully understand the representations and warranties it is 
required to make pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. 
The Units cannot be resold or otherwise transferred unless they are subsequently registered under the 
Securities Act and other applicable securities laws, or exemptions from such registration requirements are 
available. It is not contemplated that registration of the Units under the Securities Act or other securities 
laws will ever be effected. There is no public market for the Units, and none is expected to develop. 
Therefore, an investor that purchases the Units may be required to hold the Units for an indefinite period 
of time. The Units, if certificated, will bear a legend describing such transfer limitations. 
17.2. United States Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
An investment in the Units and the underlying Common LP Units and Class A Shares by certain U.S. 
employee benefit plans is subject to additional considerations because the investments of such plans are 
subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of the U.S. Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and restrictions imposed by Section 
4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC"). For these purposes the term 
"employee benefit plan" includes, but is not limited to, qualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus 
plans, Keogh plans, simplified employee pension plans and tax deferred annuities or IRAs established or 
maintained by an employer or employee organization. Among other things, such employee benefit plans 
should give consideration to: 
• whether the investment is prudent under ERISA. 
• whether in making the investment, that plan will satisfy the diversification requirements of ERISA; 
and 
• whether the investment will result in recognition of unrelated business taxable income by the plan 
and, if so, the potential after-tax investment return. 
The person with investment discretion with respect to the assets of an employee benefit plan, often called 
a fiduciary, should also determine whether an investment in the Units and the underlying Common LP 
Units and Class A Shares is authorized by the appropriate governing instrument and is a proper 
investment for the plan. 
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the IRC also prohibit employee benefit plans, and also IRAs 
that are not considered part of an employee benefit plan, from engaging in specified transactions 
involving "plan assets" with parties that are "parties in interest" under ERISA or "disqualified persons" 
under the IRC with respect to the plan. 
In addition to considering whether the purchase of Units and the Common LP Units and Class A Shares is 
a prohibited transaction, a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan should consider whether the plan will, by 
making such an investment, be deemed to own an undivided interest in the assets of KUE or the General 
Partner, with the result that KUE or the General Partner would be subject to the regulatory restrictions of 
ERISA, including its prohibited transaction rules, as well as the prohibited transaction rules of the IRC. 
The U.S. Department of Labor regulations under ERISA provide guidance with respect to whether the 
assets of an entity in which employee benefit plans acquire equity interests would be deemed "plan 
assets" under some circumstances. Under these regulations, an entity's assets would not be considered 
to be "plan assets" if, among other things: 
(a) the equity interests acquired by employee benefit plans are publicly offered securities, 
i.e., the equity interests are widely held by 100 or more investors independent of the 
137 
issuer and each other, freely transferable and registered under some provisions of the 
federal securities laws; 
(b) the entity is an "operating company," meaning it is primarily engaged in the production or 
sale of a product or service other than the investment of capital either directly or through 
a majority-owned subsidiary or subsidiaries; or 
(c) the entity is a "venture capital operating company," meaning that at least 50% of its 
assets, determined on certain testing dates, are invested in operating companies with 
respect to which the entity has contractual management rights which the entity actually 
exercises in the ordinary course of its business; or 
(d) there is no significant investment by benefit plan investors, which is defined to mean that 
less than 25% of the value of each class of equity interest is held by the employee benefit 
plans referred to above, IRAs and other employee benefit plans not subject to ERISA, 
including U.S. and non-U.S. governmental plans. 
The General Partner intends to operate the General Partner and KUE in such fashion that, for purposes 
of the plan asset regulations, the assets of KUE and the General Partner will not be considered assets of 
any plan investing in KUE and the General Partner. The Limited Partnership Agreement (and the 
organizational documents of the General Partner) will confer on the General Partner (and the Principals) 
the authority to take any action necessary or desirable in order to prevent Company assets and General 
Partner assets from being considered to be plan assets, including the authority to restructure any aspects 
of KUE and the authority to cause the redemption or sale of Units held by some or all plan investors. 
KUE is considering whether and to what extent to permit plan investors to invest in the Units. Due to the 
complexity of the applicable rules and the penalties imposed upon persons involved in prohibited 
transactions, it is particularly important that potential purchasers that are plans consult with their counsel 
regarding the consequences under ERISA of their acquisition and ownership of the Units. Employee 
benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA) and certain church plans 
(as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) are not subject to ERISA requirements but may be subject to 
analogous provisions under applicable state, local or non-U.S. law. 
17.3. Anti-Money Laundering — Cayman Islands 
In order to comply with regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering in any applicable 
jurisdictions, the General Partner and KUE are required to adopt and maintain anti-money laundering 
procedures, and may require prospective investors to provide evidence to verify their identity. 
Accordingly, the General Partner (and its directors) reserve the right to request such information as they 
consider necessary to verify the identity of a prospective investor. Where permitted, and subject to 
certain conditions, the General Partner and KUE may also delegate the maintenance of its anti-money 
laundering procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person. The 
General Partner (and its directors) may refuse to accept any subscription application if a prospective 
investor delays in producing or fails to produce any information required by the General Partner (and its 
directors) for the purpose of verification and, in that event, any funds received will be returned without 
interest to the account from which the moneys were originally debited. 
The General Partner and KUE also reserve the right to refuse to make any redemption payment to a 
shareholder of the General Partner or a partner of KUE, as applicable, if they suspect or are advised that 
the payment of redemption proceeds to such person might result in a breach of applicable anti-money 
laundering or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction, or if such refusal is 
considered necessary or appropriate to ensure the compliance by the General Partner and KUE with any 
such laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction. 
138 
If any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects that another person is engaged in money 
laundering or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or 
suspicion came to their attention in the course of their business the person will be required to report such 
belief or suspicion to either the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the 
Proceeds of Criminal Conduct Law (2005 Revision) if the disclosure relates to money laundering or to a 
police officer of the rank of constable or higher if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or 
terrorist property, pursuant to the Terrorism Law. Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of 
confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or 
otherwise. 
17.4. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The General Partner, KUE, its subsidiaries and joint ventures intend to comply with applicable provisions 
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") in connection with their business activities worldwide. The 
FCPA prohibits corrupt payments to foreign officials, (including any officer or employee of a foreign 
government, a public international organization, or any department or agency thereof, or any person 
acting in an official capacity, regardless of rank or position), parties or candidates to obtain or retain 
business or securing any improper advantage and the FCPA prohibits paying, offering, promising to pay, 
directly or indirectly, money or anything of value in connection therewith. 
Investors will be required to provide information on whether they are foreign officials, and confirm that 
they have not paid, offered to pay or promised to pay and do not intend to pay, offer to pay or promise to 
pay, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any foreign official, party or candidate to obtain or 
retain business (whether with a government or agency or instrumentality thereof or otherwise) for or on 
behalf of KUE, its subsidiaries or joint ventures or to secure an improper advantage for KUE or its 
subsidiaries or joint ventures in any country. 
139 
18. CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 
The following summary of the taxation of KUE and the taxation of the Partners of KUE is based 
upon current law and does not purport to be a comprehensive discussion of all the tax 
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Units. Legislative, judicial or 
administrative changes may be forthcoming that could affect this summary. 
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS, WE 
ADVISE YOU THAT: (i) ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES CONTAINED 
HEREIN IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED UPON, AND CANNOT BE 
RELIED UPON, BY INVESTORS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAX-RELATED 
PENALTIES UNDER THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OR APPLICABLE STATE OR 
LOCAL TAX LAW PROVISIONS; (ii) SUCH DISCUSSION IS BEING USED IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF TREASURY 
REGULATIONS) BY THE COMPANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS 
ADDRESSED HEREIN; (iii) INVESTORS SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THEIR 
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR. 
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS (INCLUDING ALL NON-U.S. PERSONS AS DEFINED BELOW) 
SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, 
LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OWNING COMMON LP UNITS UNDER 
THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRIES OF CITIZENSHIP, RESIDENCE, ORDINARY 
RESIDENCE, OR DOMICILE. 
18.1. Cayman Taxation 
There is, at present, no direct taxation in the Cayman Islands. The Government of the Cayman Islands, 
will not, under existing legislation, impose any income, corporate or capital gains tax, estate duty, 
inheritance tax, gift tax, or withholding tax upon KUE, its partners, the General Partner, or its 
shareholders. Similarly interest, dividends and gains payable to KUE and all distributions by KUE to its 
partners will be received free of any Cayman Islands income or withholding taxes. 
KUE has registered as an exempted limited partnership under Cayman Islands law and KUE has 
received an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the Cayman Islands to the effect that, for a 
period of 50 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands 
imposing any tax to be levied on profits or income or gains or appreciations shall apply to KUE or to any 
partner of KUE in respect of the operations or assets of KUE or the interest of a partner in KUE; and may 
further provide that any such taxes or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be 
payable in respect of the obligations of KUE or the interests of the partners in KUE. 
The General Partner of KUE has registered as an exempted company under Cayman Islands law and the 
General Partner has received an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the Cayman Islands that, in 
accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a 
period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands 
imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate 
duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on the shares of the General Partner or (fi) by way of the 
withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by the 
General Partner to its shareholders. 
The Cayman Islands does not have a double tax treaty with the United States or any other country.

18.2. United States Federal Income Taxation 
The following summary sets forth the material U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the 
purchase, ownership, and disposition of Common LP Units. Unless otherwise stated, this summary deals 
only with partners that are U.S. Persons (as defined below) who purchase their Common LP Units in this 
offering and who hold their Common LP Units as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the 
Code. The following discussion is only a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax matters as 
described herein and does not purport to address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that 
may be relevant to a particular Limited Partner of KUE ("Limited Partner") in light of such Limited Partner's 
specific circumstances. In addition, except as expressly stated, the following summary does not address 
the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to special classes of Limited Partners 
who may be subject to special rules or treatment under the Code, such as financial institutions, insurance 
companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, or other pass-
through entities, dealers or traders in securities, tax-exempt organizations, expatriates, any person who 
owns or is deemed to own, for U.S. federal income tax purpose, 10% or more of the total combined voting 
power of all classes of voting stock of the corporate subsidiaries of KUE, persons that have a "functional 
currency" other than the United States dollar, and any individual who is a non-U.S. Person (as defined 
below) and who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in a taxable year. This discussion does not 
include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments within the U.S. No ruling has 
been or will be sought from the IRS regarding any matter discussed herein. Counsel to KUE has not 
rendered any legal opinion regarding any tax consequences relating to KUE or an investment in KUE. No 
assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position 
contrary to any of the positions taken by KUE as set forth below. 
For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. Person" means (1) a citizen or resident of the U.S., (2) a 
corporation created or organized in or under the laws of any State of the U.S. (including the District of 
Columbia), (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its 
source, (4) a trust if either (a) a court within the U.S. is able to exercise primary supervision over the 
administration of such trust and one or more U.S. Persons have the authority to control all substantial 
decisions of such trust or (b) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes, or (5) any other person or entity that is treated for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes as if it were one of the foregoing. The term "non-U.S. Person" means any person other than a 
U.S. Person. 
18.2.1 United States Federal Income Taxation of KUE and its Subsidiaries 
Partnership Status of KUE. KUE believes that it should be classified as a partnership for United States 
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, KUE is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income 
tax liability. Instead, each Partner will be allocated its share of KUE's income or loss, as the case may be, 
for United States federal income tax purposes as set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement. In 
addition, each U.S. Partner's share of income or loss from KUE generally will be required to be includable 
in income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which the investor is a resident and in the 
jurisdictions in which KUE operates. Each U.S. Partner will be responsible for paying the income tax on 
that portion of KUE's income allocated to such investor. No assurances can be given that any cash 
distribution will be made from KUE to the partners to pay such income tax liabilities. 
Under the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their 
income. Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation, 
referred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S. 
corporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S. 
corporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S. 
Secretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-U.S. 
corporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision, 
including adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose. Recently issued 
141 
Treasury regulations provide that the anti-inversion legislation is applicable to a foreign partnership that is 
or becomes a "publicly traded partnership" within two years of the acquisition by it of a U.S. corporation. 
A "publicly traded partnership" is any partnership (i) interests in which are traded on an established 
securities market, or (ii) interests in which are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial 
equivalent thereof). KUE believes that it is not currently a publicly traded partnership and does not intend 
to become a publicly traded partnership within two years of this offering or the acquisition of KLC and k12. 
As a result, KUE does not believe the anti-inversion legislation or any regulations promulgated within the 
scope of the legislation's regulatory authority should apply to KUE although no assurance can be given in 
this regard or with respect to any new acquisitions of or investment in U.S. corporations. In addition, KUE 
does not believe that any other Code provision subjecting non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income 
tax should apply to KUE or its subsidiaries, although no assurance can be given in this regards. The 
promulgation of contrary regulations or a successful challenge of either of these positions by the Internal 
Revenue Service could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and, thus, could result in a substantial 
reduction of the value of the Units. 
The remainder of this section assumes that KUE will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes. 
18.2.2 United States Federal Income Taxation of Partners 
U.S. Persons 
Allocation of Purchase Price. You will be treated as purchasing a Unit consisting of two components, one 
Common LP Unit and one GP Share. Your purchase price for each Unit will be allocated between one 
Common LP Unit and one GP Share in proportion to their relative fair market values at the time of your 
purchase, and this allocation will establish your initial tax basis in both your ownership interest in the 
Common LP Unit and your GP Share. We will treat the fair market value of each Common LP Share at 
$999 and the fair market value of each GP Share as $1. 
Flow-Through of Taxable Income. KUE will not pay any U.S. federal income tax. Instead, each Partner 
will be required to report on its income tax return its allocable share (as determined pursuant to the 
Limited Partnership Agreement) of KUE's income, gains, losses, and deductions without regard to 
whether corresponding cash distributions are made. The Limited Partnership Agreement authorizes the 
General Partner to override the allocation provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement and allocate 
income, gains, losses and deductions of KUE to the Partners in a manner that achieves the desired 
economic arrangement of KUE, which is to return each Partner's capital contribution and then for all 
Partners (including the holder of Profits Participation LP Units) to share in the profits of KUE in proportion 
to the number of Units held by them. 
The IRS may challenge the manner in which income, gains, losses and deductions are allocated to 
holders of Common LP Units, the General Partner and holders of the Profits Participation LP Units under 
the Limited Partnership Agreement. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocation of any item of 
income, gain, loss or deduction to a partner in a partnership will be given effect so long as the allocation 
has "substantial economic effect," or is otherwise in accordance with the partner's interest in the 
partnership. If an allocation of an item pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement does not satisfy 
this standard or is deemed not to satisfy this standard by the IRS, it will be reallocated by the IRS among 
the Partners on the basis of their respective interests in KUE (as determined by the IRS), taking into 
account all facts and circumstances. In such a case, holders of Common LP Units could have additional 
tax liabilities or suffer adverse tax consequences. 
Treatment of Cash Distributions. KUE's distributions to a Partner generally will not be taxable to the 
Partner for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of such Partner's adjusted tax basis in its 
Common LP Units immediately before the distribution. Cash distributions in excess of a Limited Partner's 
adjusted tax basis generally will be considered to be gain from the sale or exchange of the Common LP 
Units. Any reduction in a Limited Partner's share of KUE's liabilities, if any, for which no Partner bears the 
142 
economic risk of loss, known as "nonrecourse liabilities," will be treated as a deemed distribution of cash 
to that Partner. A decrease in a Partner's percentage interest in KUE because of KUE's issuance of 
additional limited partner units ("Limited Partner Units") would decrease such Partner's share of Company 
nonrecourse liabilities, if any, and thus would result in a corresponding deemed distribution of cash. 
Treatment of In-Kind Distributions. KUE's distribution of property (other than cash) to a Partner generally 
will not be taxable to the Partner unless the property is a "marketable security" and the exceptions to the 
requirement for recognition of gain upon distributions of marketable securities do not apply. Marketable 
securities, for these purposes, include actively traded securities or equity interests in another entity that 
are readily convertible into or exchangeable for cash or other marketable securities. If the distributed 
property constitutes a marketable security, the property would be treated as cash and the Partner would 
recognize gain, but not loss, to the extent described above. 
Basis of Common LP Units. A Limited Partner will have an initial tax basis for its Common LP Units equal 
to the amount it paid for the Common LP Units plus its share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. 
That basis will be increased by the Limited Partner's share of Company income and by any increases in 
its share of Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. That basis will be decreased, but not below zero, by 
distributions from KUE, by the Limited Partner's share of KUE losses, by any decrease in its share of 
Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any, and by its share of Company expenditures that are not deductible 
in computing KUE's taxable income and are not required to be capitalized. 
Limitations on Deductibility of Company Losses. The deduction by a Limited Partner of its share of 
Company losses will be limited to the adjusted tax basis in its Common LP Units. Limited Partners should 
be aware that they could be subject to various other limitations on their ability to deduct their allocable 
shares of Company losses (or items of deductions). Such limitations include, but are not limited to, those 
relating to "investment interest" expense under Section 163(d) of the Code, "miscellaneous itemized 
deductions" under Section 67 of the Code, certain other itemized deductions of high income individuals 
under Section 68 of the Code, the "at risk" rules under Section 465 of the Code, and the deductibility of 
capital losses under the Code. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to the 
potential application of such rules to their particular situation. 
Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss, and Deduction. If KUE has a net profit or net loss, its items of income, 
gain, loss, and deduction will be allocated among the Partners in accordance with the provisions of the 
Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Dispositions of Common LP Units — Recognition of Gain or Loss. A Limited Partner will recognize gain or 
loss on a sale of Common LP Units equal to the difference between the amount realized and the Limited 
Partner's adjusted tax basis for the Common LP Units sold. A Limited Partner's amount realized will be 
measured by the sum of cash or the fair market value of other property received plus its share of 
Company nonrecourse liabilities, if any. Generally, gain or loss recognized by a Limited Partner on the 
sale or exchange of Common LP Units will be taxable as capital gain or loss and as long-term capital gain 
or loss if the Common LP Units were held for more than twelve months. 
Non-U.S. Persons 
Withholding. Ownership of Common LP Units by non-U.S. Persons raises special U.S. federal income 
tax considerations. To the extent that KUE receives dividends from a U.S. subsidiary, distributions of 
such dividend income to Limited Partners who are non-U.S. Persons will be subject to U.S. withholding at 
a rate of 30%. Certain countries have tax treaties with the U.S. that reduce or eliminate the withholding 
requirement. To the extent that KUE receives dividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary, distributions of such 
dividend income to Limited Partners who are non-U.S. Persons will not be subject to U.S. tax, unless 
such income were deemed to be effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by KUE in the 
U.S. KUE will be required to pay withholding tax with respect to the portion of KUE's income that is 
"effectively connected" with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and which is allocable to non-U.S. 
Persons. Any amounts KUE is required to remit to taxing authorities will be treated as a distribution to the 
Partner on whose behalf the withholding is being paid and will be charged against current and/or future 
143 
distributions such Partner would otherwise be entitled to. If KUE is required to withhold on amounts in 
excess of cash distributions, Partners shall be required to contribute to KUE cash in an amount by which 
such required withholding exceeds any such distributions. 
Gain on Sale. A Limited Partner that is a non-U.S. Person will be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon 
the sale or exchange of its Common LP Units to the extent that such Limited Partner recognizes gain 
upon such sale or exchange and such gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. 
U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation. If a direct U.S. subsidiary of KUE is or were to become a 
"United States Real Property Holding Corporation," or "USRPHC" (as defined below), certain disposition 
of Common LP Units by a Limited Partner that is a non-U.S. Person would result in such Limited Partner 
being subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the portion of the gain recognized on such 
disposition that is attributable to such subsidiary. In addition, if a direct U.S. subsidiary of KUE is or were 
to become a USRPHC, certain dispositions of such subsidiary by KUE would result in Limited Partners 
who are non-U.S. Persons being subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of their allocable share of 
the gain recognized by KUE on such disposition. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market 
value of its "U.S. real property interests" equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its 
worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. KUE 
believes that each of its direct U.S. subsidiaries is not currently a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that in the 
future one of KUE's subsidiaries may become a USRPHC if, for example, the value of the U.S. real estate 
holdings of such subsidiary increases sufficiently. Limited Partners that are non-U.S. Persons are urged 
to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the USRPHC rules to their investment in 
KUE. 
Administrative Matters 
Backup Withholding. For each calendar year, KUE will report to its U.S. Partners and to the Internal 
Revenue Service the amount of distributions that it pays, and the amount of tax (if any) that it withholds 
on these distributions. Under the backup withholding rules, a U.S. Limited Partner may be subject to 
backup withholding tax with respect to distributions unless a Limited Partner: (i) is a corporation or comes 
within another exempt category and demonstrates this fact when required or (U) provides a taxpayer 
identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding tax and otherwise 
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules. Exempt Limited Partners 
who are U.S. Persons should indicate their exempt status on a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN. 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax, the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a 
Limited Partner will be allowed as a credit against such Limited Partner's U.S. federal income tax liability.
