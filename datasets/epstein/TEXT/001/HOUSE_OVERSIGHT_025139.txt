Jeffrey 
finally landed 
very unpleasant journey 
you had nothing to do with how Chapman acted and i apologise for suggesting it might be otherwise 
it was entirely against me, partly motivated by a spiteful ex-friend 
consulted two lawyers that Gordon recommended but they were very discouraging 
the basic problem is simple—i am going against a strong national trend—well-known man after well-known man is being brought low for alleged his 
misbehaviour toward women—in some case well-deserved prison time (Cosby and perhaps Weinstein) in many other cases, simply being run out of 
institutions—exactly my fate 
furthermore in he say/she say confrontations the evidence has shifted—in University settings at least—from 'beyond a reasonable doubt' to a 
'preponderance of evidence' to 'more positive than negative' 
the loss is huge, on the order of a half million to a million dollars, meant to keep me alive (they were going to offer a five-year contract) while i let 
my 'inheritance' be spent on children and grandchildren while also growing 
i have no choice but to work 
i will get my revised Wild Life to an agent later this week—have added 5 new chapters and a few sections—much stronger for the inclusion of my 
major scientific work-1. social theory based on natural selection and 2. selfish genetic elements selected within organisms 
then i have Honour Killings set to roll, as well as another one 
hope you are thriving—and also hope Trump will stop this international trade nonsense—a lose/lose war—especially as it affects the stock market or 
so it seems to me 
best wishes
