Laffer: Obama Must Use Reaganomics to Save Economy The only way President Barack Obama can solve the 
nation's economic woes is to adopt "common-sense" Reaganomics, the policy's architect Arthur Laffer claims 
in an exclusive Newsmax interview. 
Laffer said the White House called him in the spring and asked him to speak to Obama's former Council of 
Economic Advisors' chairman Austen Goolsbee — and he had told him exactly the same thing. 
"Reaganomics would fix any economy that's in the doldrums," Laffer said. "It's not a magic sauce, it's 
common sense. 
"You've got to get rid of all federal taxes in the extreme and replace them with a low-rate flat tax on business 
net sales, and on personal unadjusted gross income. That's number one. 
"Number two, you have to have spending restraint. Government spending causes unemployment, it does not 
cure unemployment. 
"Number three, you need sound money. Ben Bernanke is running the least sound monetary policy I've ever 
heard of," Laffer said. 
"Number four you need regulations, but you don't need those regulations to go beyond the purpose at hand and 
create collateral damage. The regulatory policies are really way off here. 
"And lastly you need free trade," Laffer said. "Foreigners produce some things better than we do and we 
produce some things better than foreigners. It would be foolish in the extreme if we didn't sell them those things 
we produce better than they do in exchange for those things they produce better than we do." 
In the interview the veteran economist said Standard & Poor's was quite right in downgrading the U.S. credit 
rating — in fact it should have done so far earlier. 
The agency had no choice and if the other agencies, Moody's and Fitch, don't do the same they won't be doing 
their jobs, said Laffer, who gave his name to the Laffer Curve which demonstrates that the maximum amount of 
government revenue does not come at the point of maximum taxes. 
______`If you had a company that had revenues of $21/2 million and expenses of $4 million, with no change in 
sight, $11/2 million in losses each year as far as the eye can see and it had already borrowed $10 million, what 
would you rate that company? I surely wouldn't rate it AAA. 
"That is the U.S. situation today," Laffer said. "Taxes are about $21/2 trillion, government spending is about $4 
trillion and we have about $10 trillion in net national debt. I don't see that as being a AAA country. 
"If the S&P and the others were doing their jobs correctly, they should have downgraded a long time ago." 
Laffer said he has no doubt the country will win its top rating back, but only when economic policies are

completely turned around. He said President Barack Obama's administration's only economic plan seemed to 
be to expand government ownership of the means of production. 
"They have nationalized the health care industry pretty extensively. They've done that with home building as 
well. They've tried it with the auto industry as well. So they have moved very, very deliberatively and 
purposefully toward extending the government ownership of the means of production. 
"That to me, if you read the tealeaves, is what they are doing. It is not what they are saying they are doing, but 
that is what they actually are doing. 
"People don't work to pay taxes, people work to get what they can after taxes. It's that very private incentive 
that motivates them to work. If you pay people not to work and tax them if they do work, don't be surprised if 
you find a lot of people not working." 
Laffer said the current economic woes started to form under President George W. Bush but have been made 
worse by Obama's policies. 
"There's a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received and that wedge is the tax/government 
spending wedge," he said. 
"That wedge has grown dramatically in the last 4 1/2 years...under W and a Republican administration 
and...under Obama. Bipartisan ignorance has led us to this very disastrously desolate state." 
Laffer had high praise for the role the tea party has played in bringing the problem of the deficits to the fore. 
"The tea party is not the problem, the tea party may well be the solution," he said. "They are critical to the 
future of the country in a positive way. They are the only fiscally sound people I know out there all the time. 
"I don't know that I would go as far as they go on a lot of issues but I surely respect their movement very 
much." 
And he said any one of the group of Republicans vying for the party's nomination for the White House would 
make" a great president." 
"Tim Pawlenty is spectacular. Newt Gingrich knows more about issues than anyone you've ever seen. Michele 
Bachmann is out-of-sight wonderful," he said. 
"Rick Perry is second to no one in this stuff If you look at Herman Cain, he's phenomenal. 
"Oh and (Jon) Huntsman was a great governor of the state of Utah and is a phenomenally experienced 
intellectual competent man. 
"When you look at the Republican candidates, you see a group of people who are absolutely outstanding in 
attributes."
