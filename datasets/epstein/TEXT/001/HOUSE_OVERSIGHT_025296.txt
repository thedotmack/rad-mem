Summary
To save you the agony of plodding through this fascinating, information-rich paper, I’ll get straight to the point: Donald Trump
will be the next President of the United States after having won an easy victory over Hillary Clinton in November 2016. The
reasons:
I.)
II.)
III.)
Section one shows that the essential characteristics of the narrative for the Trump campaign and the Reagan campaign
of 1980 are surprisingly similar, which would point to a Trump landslide.
Section two describes the poor state of the current economy using detrended GDP per adult, the ratio of employmentto-adult-population
and new home sales per 1,000 adults and how these measures strongly indicate a Republican
victory.
Using historical data for the Gallup poll question “are you satisfied” and presidential election dates, this section would
point to an overwhelming Republican win in November 2016.
IV.) Relying on voter turnout data this year versus earlier years and party selection, the Republicans have a large advantage
coming into the Fall election.
V.)
Basing our forecast on the past eight years of Congressional elections—House and Senate—as well as state elections
of house, senate and governors, the Republicans should be exceedingly confident about the upcoming presidential
election.
VI.) Taking careful measure of what both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have done in the public eye, Trump has the
issues on his side.
I. 1979-1980 How the Reagan Revolution Began
In early 1979, a group of Ronald Reagan acolytes—some 10 to 15 in total—got together in Justin Dart’s office at Rexall (the
corner of La Cienega and Beverly) and there they formed the original Reagan Executive Advisory Committee. With very few
exceptions (initially only me), this group had been called Reagan’s Kitchen Cabinet. Those present and those also invited
included Justin Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Jack Wrather, Bill French Smith, Bill Wilson, Earle Jorgensen, Ben Biaggini, Ted
Cummings, Alfred Bloomingdale, Charles Wick, Henry Salvatori et moi. I was the youngest of the group by three decades.
And, in fact, the only way Justin Dart could convince the others to let me be a member was that they needed someone to keep
the minutes of the meetings, i.e. as a secretary. In speaking with a reporter about the Kitchen Cabinet, here’s what Jus Dart
had to say: “In addressing the question of how many of Reagan's friends actually qualify as members, Dart said: ‘Damn fewer
than is generally advertised.’” 1 That just says it all.
The purpose of this committee was to provide guidance and support to the emerging presidential candidacy of one Ronald
Reagan. The members were to a person close, close, close friends and supporters of Ronald Reagan or husbands of Nancy
Reagan’s best friends. And the race for the White House began.
During this pre-primary and primary process, Ronald Reagan was disrespected and abused by a significant segment of the
Republican establishment. 2 He was called an empty suit, a trigger-happy California cowboy, only an actor, a person who
spoke words others wrote, a racist, a bigot, a divorcée, a war monger and the man who would start the Third World War. My
favorite slur came from none other than the Democratic Party’s “éminence grise” Clark Clifford, 3 who referred to Ronald
Reagan as an “amiable dunce.” The torrent of anti-Reagan epithets never stopped.

As if receiving divine retribution for his nasty ways, Clark Clifford, who served as Secretary of Defense for President Johnson and as an advisor to
Presidents Truman, Kennedy and Carter, was indicted in the early 1990s on charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery surrounding the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International scandal.

In fact, the whole group of us received virtually no support from the Republican Party or the Party’s elders. It wasn’t until
Reagan had finally defeated George Bush, along with John Connally, Howard Baker, Phil Crane, Bob Dole and John Anderson
in the primary race, that there was any attempt to be conciliatory to Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign by the Republican
powers that were. Even Barry Goldwater, whose career owed so much to Ronald Reagan, was cool at best to a Reagan
presidency.
I remember one post-Bush-defeat meeting of our committee when we had already secured the nomination and George Herbert
Walker Bush sat next to me and lightly apologized for referring to me as the “Voo-Doo Economist.” In truth, I had sort of
enjoyed the handle, and told H.W. Bush that I was delighted he finally had come to join us because I needed some fellow
Yalies to up the quality of our group. He laughed.
Things had been so vitriolic and bad during the primary campaign that a number of Republicans couldn’t in clear conscience
support Ronald Reagan at all and others could only support him in name only. And one of the primary contestants, John
Anderson, Republican Congressman from Illinois, was so offended by Ronald Reagan’s nomination that he decided to run as
an independent in the general election, which he did. While, in hindsight, John Anderson’s decision may now seem like a nonevent,
it sure wasn’t seen as a frivolous gesture back then. Ronald Reagan looked like a sure loser with both a moderate
Republican opponent and a sitting Democratic President, with all the privilege, prestige and power that the Office of the
President holds.
At the convention in Detroit City, I testified before the platform committee on what I thought Reaganomics would be—which
was lots of fun. But, the real drama occurred when it came time to select Ronald Reagan’s running mate. Showing no signs
of remorse or respect for the primary voters, the Party’s establishment conspired to browbeat Ronald Reagan into accepting
Gerald Ford as Ronald Reagan’s co-president running mate. They—the establishment—were absolutely certain that Ronald
Reagan would be blown away by Carter in November of 1980 and that the down ticket Republican candidates would get their
lunch handed to them. So much for the wisdom of Republican elders and insiders.
In other words, just like today in re Donald Trump, the party’s cognoscenti were forecasting a huge Reagan defeat that would
carry with it large numbers of House members and Senators. Reagan, they thought, would prove to be more devastating to
Republicans than either the Goldwater defeat of 1964 or the Ford defeat of 1976.
As you all know, none of this happened. We handily defeated Carter, even though we were behind in the polls as recently as
1 week before the election. 4 Reagan took 44 states and 50.7% of the popular vote to Carter’s 41% of the vote and Anderson’s
6.6% of the vote. Whodathunkit? I’m naturally an optimist, but I’ve never been more optimistic than I am today or than I was
in 1980, and I’ve never had more fun than I had in the several years before Ronald Reagan’s election. The Reagan saga of
1980 seems a lot like the Trump story today.
II. “It’s the Economy Stupid” – James Carville 1992
In the 2016 primaries, each and every Republican candidate promised lower tax rates, restrained government spending, sound
money and greatly lessened regulations. The mantra was repeal “Obamacare,” eviscerate Dodd-Frank and cut taxes. There
couldn’t have been a more supply-side, pro-growth field of candidates assembled in the entire history of our nation—not one
outlier. It almost became a Republican feeding frenzy as to who could propose the lowest tax rate and create the most growth.
Debates on economic issues were super boring and hyperbole as to who could be the most pro-growth supply sider infused
the air we breathe. In truth, every Republican, from Jim Gilmore to Donald Trump, understood that America was in free fall
and needed a huge dose of incentive alignments. There was very little room for debate on the issues because the candidates
all agreed with each other.
The Democrats, once O’Malley, Webb and Chafee exited stage left, were pulling each other further and further to the “Free
Lunch Tax the Rich” ticket. Already way over-subsidized, students were promised free college by Sanders, and America would
have a $15 federal minimum wage everywhere. And then there was expanded free health care, huge tax increases on Wall
Street exploiters and on the rich in general. The Walton family was singled out as the perfect example of what’s wrong with
America: one family whose net worth was close to $150 billion and whose legacy company, Walmart, paid workers’ wages so
low that full-time employees qualified for welfare. The Democrats defined their enemies as the most successful innovators,
investors, job-creators and employers in America.
The Democrats also, in their never-ending debates, careened further and further toward “from each according to his ability and
to each according to his need” paradise. The most enthusiastic crowds were energized by the endearing, wild-eyed,
septuagenarian Socialist whose unkempt, long white hair became emblematic of “enough is enough already”: Uncle Bernie
Sanders. Who doesn’t love Bernie Sanders? Or, as his throngs of acolytes scream, who doesn’t “feel the Bern?”

Reagan’s surge in polls is generally attributed to the presidential debate held one week before the election took place, on October 28 th , immediately
after which Reagan appears to have moved into a 3 point lead. See: Lydia Saad, “Late Upsets Are Rare, but Have Happened,” Gallup, October 27,

Hillary’s and Bernie’s kabuki dance is far from over. The continued Sanders’ humiliation and exposé of Clinton is profoundly
damaging to the Democrats’ prospects, while the Republicans have just chosen their candidate. Someone ought to tell that
to Bill Kristol.
What is patently obvious from the rise of Bernie Sanders and the massive, hard fought battle in the Republican primary is that
economic discontent is at an all-time high. The electorate wants economic change NOW.
But, then there’s Hillary Clinton’s take on the economy and the Obama record. Like Pat Buchanan’s protectionist niche some
20 years ago, there is a segment of America that truly likes the Obama record. But, that segment is not even close to being
large enough to elect a winner.
Hillary Clinton’s political and academic credentials are second to none—Wellesley undergraduate, Yale Law School,
Watergate trial activist, Rose Law firm lawyer, First Lady, Senator from New York, and President Obama’s Secretary of State.
She has been indefatigably toiling her way through the political superstructure to be the next President of the United States:
the incarnation of an Obama third term and protector of the Obama legacy. This tack that she has taken is helpful in the
Democratic primary, especially among African Americans, but is a very large mistake in a general election and reflects poorly
on her political judgement.
Judging from the three most important metrics of the economy: i.) detrended real nondefense GDP per adult from 1950 to the
present, ii.) employment as a share of adult population during the post-World War II period, and iii.) new housing sales per
1,000 adults over the past 55 years, anyone who runs on the Obama record is at a great, great, great disadvantage.
Just look at each of these three measures of economic performance:

Even when a president’s term ends on a high note, as was the case with Presidents Kennedy, Reagan and Clinton, it is a
challenge for the incumbent party to maintain the White House. Thus, given that detrended real nondefense GDP per adult as
a measure of our country’s economic performance has ended on very low notes for Obama, “W” Bush and Bush Sr., it is clear

Note: the gray vertical lines in figures throughout this paper represent the election dates of these individual presidents. The reason for this (rather
than placing vertical lines on inauguration dates) is that we’re using economic metrics throughout this paper as indicators of votes rather than as
descriptors for the success or failure of presidential policies.

that the economy is shouting for a party change. This does not bode well for the Democratic Party, which continues to endorse
the current status quo.
And to confirm GDP growth’s implications, we also have the disappointing measure of employment to adult population. Again,
there is every reason on Earth to change parties now. There literally has been no Obama recovery, and Hillary Clinton
promises she’ll do more of the same. The U.S. has about 10 million fewer jobs per year than we would have had if the ratio
of employment to adult population were what it was in mid-2000.
Just compare the ascent of the employment to adult population ratio for the eight years of Obama to the Johnson years, or
even to the Nixon years, and especially to the Reagan and Clinton years. This Obama economy really isn’t a recovery, let
alone a strong recovery, as one would expect should have happened following the devastating collapse of the Great
Recession. Why would Hillary Clinton want to run on the Obama record? It’s beyond me.

Using detrended real GDP per adult and total employment per adult, there have been two elections since Truman was elected
in 1948 that appear to contradict my economic improvement hypothesis—the Nixon election in 1968 and the Obama reelection
in 2012. Both of these elections appear to have had very strong extraneous factors at work. For Nixon’s success, the huge
outrage against Johnson’s handling of the Vietnam War could well have overpowered the seemingly good economy and for
Obama in 2012 a high racial sensitivity quotient could also have tipped the scales. If anything, today the war and racial
sensitivity issues operate against the Democrats.
What I beg you to look at carefully are the virtually identical precipitous drops in the economy immediately preceding the
Presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama and the totally opposite results during their respective Presidencies. I just
can’t see how a pro-Obama candidate can win in 2016.

Far from being a change agent, once Obama took office, he doubled down on the Bush economic agenda, kept Bush’s key
economic advisors and thereby created further down-drafts for the economy.
The simple fact that absolutely leaps off these charts is the abysmal record attained by the 7+ years of the Obama
Administration. To be fair, the decline began when “W” took office and accelerated greatly when Bush, aided by Geithner and
Bernanke, bailed everyone out and spent huge sums of U.S. resources trying to stimulate the economy—all to no avail. To
me, the circumstances today are almost identical to those of 1980—16 years of bad economics about to be followed by a
political renaissance.
For Hillary Clinton, the Obama record on the economy will be her biggest negative come November. And the very fact that
she actually sought out and embraces this legacy speaks volumes about her judgement.
III. All Elections are Referenda on Incumbents
The Mood of the Country – The History of the Gallup Poll
Whether fair or not, Hillary Clinton is viewed as a Democratic insider and establishment regular. As such, she benefits greatly
in her ability to raise money and attract superdelegate support. But, there’s also a downside to being a Democratic insider
and establishment regular today. When the electorate is unhappy with the direction the country is heading, she’ll also be
blamed right along with the President and other members of his party. This is exactly what happened to the Presidencies of
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush Sr., Bush “W” and presumptively Obama.
If any one of you remembers the contested Democratic primary of 1980 when Senator Ted Kennedy challenged his party’s
sitting President, you will be reminded of the current Democratic primary where Bernie Sanders continues to humiliate Hillary
Clinton, primary after primary. While Senator Kennedy lost in his quest to secure the Democratic nomination, he clearly
exposed all the weaknesses of President Carter, just as Senator Bernie Sanders is exposing Hilary Clinton’s vulnerability.
This can’t be good news for Mrs. Clinton.
For quite some time now, I have been using the Gallup poll question, “Are you satisfied with the way things are going?” as my
measure of the electorate’s level of discontent. This question has been posed by Gallup for years and years and, thus, the

electorate’s response to this question reflects a consistent indicator over a long period of time: in fact, long enough for us to
get a sense of whether this measure is a reliable guide to help forecast election results (see Figure 4). It is:
In my paper “Senate Outlook” of October 2, 2014, I relied heavily on this Gallup question to arrive at my outlandish forecast of
a seven seat gain for the Republicans in that year’s Senate races. My forecast of a seven seat pickup was probably the most
optimistic forecast at the time for the Republicans. But, as it turned out, I was off by two! The Republicans actually picked up
nine seats—West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, Alaska, Louisiana, Iowa, North Carolina and Colorado—and
lost none.

The predictive power of this Gallup poll’s “are you better off?” question since the election of 1980 is pretty impressive. Both of
Reagan elections were right in sync with Gallup’s poll survey at November of 1980 and November of 1984. Likewise, Bush
Senior’s election in November of 1988 was seen as Reagan’s third term and was foreseen by the Gallup poll question.
And then both Clinton elections were right in line with the survey results from the Gallup poll questions in November of 1992
and November of 1996.
Bush the younger’s election in 2000 is anomalous, but his reelection in 2004 is consistent with the measure as was McCain’s
(really it was Bush’s) defeat in November 2008. The 2012 election also appears contrary to the survey response to the poll
question. If this poll reestablishes its predictive power in 2016, Trump wins in a Reagan-like landslide.
IV. Primary Colors
While perhaps subtle, what happens in contested presidential primaries is also a harbinger of general elections. And if the
current Democratic and Republican primaries are accurate measures of voter enthusiasm, the Democrats are facing a tough
up-hill fight against Republicans to say the least.
Using only states with party primaries, i.e. not state caucuses, and only party primaries up to the time when Donald Trump
became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, which was following the May 3 rd Indiana primary, there has been
a large increase in voter turnout for the Republicans in 2016 when compared to either 2008 or 2012. In fact, in the 28 state
primaries through May 3 rd , the total number of Republicans who actually voted in those primaries has increased by 57.2% over
2008 and 67.1% over 2012 (see Table 1 on page 8). And, using unweighted state numbers, the 2016 Republican primary
6
Laffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]
voter turnout is up 66.6% over 2008 and 103.0% over 2012. I use both total turnout as well as equal weighted state turnout
because our Electoral College system for selecting a president is a combination of both. These numbers are astounding and
by themselves speak volumes for Republican prospects in 2016. And it is not just the Trump phenomenon; it’s the Trump
phenomenon plus much more.
But, the situation is worse for Democrats. When juxtaposed to the Democratic turnout in 2008 and 2016, the 2016 Republican
turnout looks even stronger. Remember, the 2012 Democratic primary was a non-event because President Obama, then a
sitting President, was running for nomination essentially uncontested. We therefore focus exclusively on the change from the
2008 to the 2016 Democratic Party turnout, which, using the same states, is down in total by 20.1%. And, using equal-weighted
state numbers, it’s down by 16.2%. On a state-by-state comparison, Republican turnout is way up, and Democratic turnout is
way down. Someone should ring the Democratic alarm bell.
And, even head-to-head comparisons of absolute voter turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries in 2016
and 2008 give the Republicans a definite edge for the elections of 2016 and an enormous increase over 2008. So far in 2016,
there have been 3.5 million more Republicans voting in their party’s primaries than there have been Democrats. In 2008, the
Democrats had over 11.3 million additional primary voter advantage over their Republican counterparts. This enormous
increase in Republican voter turnout over Democrats in 2016 plus the fact that there are more Republican voters in 2016 than
Democratic voters should be perhaps the single most disturbing statistic if you are a Hillary supporter, especially given the
exceptional enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders in what has turned out to be a down primary turnout for Democrats.
Even on a state-by-state basis, the flip from Democrat to Republican has been pronounced. So far in this 2016 primary season,
there are 14 new states that had Republican turnout in excess of Democratic turnout, i.e. those states in 2008 had more
Democratic turnout than Republican turnout, while in 2016 Republican turnout exceeds Democratic turnout. These states are
not, as Bernie Sanders would say, “chopped liver.” They include Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. When it comes to
the electoral college, flipping a state is far more important than is increasing the margin of victory.
What should be even more alarming to the Democrats than the party flip against Democrats in the 14 states that have already
had primaries is the fact that so far in every state, save Michigan, Democratic voter advantage over Republican’s has declined.
And Michigan, without trying to reach too far for excuses, appears to hinge on the tragedy of the Flint water contamination and
Mitt Romney’s candidacy in 2008 and 2012. And so as not to take everything away from the unique Michigan phenomenon,
it still must be remembered that in both 2008 and 2016, Republican primary turnout in Michigan was greater than Democratic
turnout.

While caucus numbers are influenced by a number of factors other than voter turnout and electorate preferences, their
implications are little different from those of the primary states.
Again these results have to be concerning for Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

V. Politics Bubbles Up from the Bottom and Presidential Selection is the Final Coup de Grace of a Political Revolution
The proposition of this section of this paper is that elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, state
houses, state senates and governorships are accurate indicators of Presidential races. If these federal and state elections are
accurate forecasters in 2016, Hillary Clinton is toast.
a.) Politics in the U.S. Congress
In January 2009, there were 57 Democrats in the U.S. Senate, 2 Independents (Sanders VT and King ME) who always voted
with and caucused with the Democrats, and 41 Republicans. Today, there are 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats plus the same
2 Independents who are effectively Democrats (see Table 5 below).
Likewise, in January 2009, there were 257 Democrats in the U.S. House and 178 Republicans. Today, the tables have turned
and the Republicans have their largest majority in the House since 1928, 247, and the Democrats have 188 House members.
Not only have the numbers changed dramatically, but the ideologies have also become more concentrated. The changes in
the U.S. Congress over the past eight years are huge and reflect an enormous swing in U.S. political sentiments. But the
groundswell doesn’t stop there.

b.) Politics in the States
In the state legislatures, the changes in the Democrat/Republican split have been equally as radical as they are in the U.S.
Congress. Counting all senate members of the various state legislatures in 2009, there were 1,024 Democrats, 889
Republicans and 58 categorized as “other.” (See Table 6 below). But today, the Democrats have only 827 State Senators,
the Republicans 1,088, with 57 categorized as other—this is the very definition of a 180 degree turn around.
In the state houses of representatives in 2009, Democrats had 3,058 members to the Republicans’ tally of 2,334 with 19
“others.” And yet, today, the Republicans control the vast majority of state houses with a grand total of 3,037 house members
to the Democrats’ 2,342 members and 32 “others.” This switch in state legislatures all but assures the Republican control of
redistricting and control of the U.S. House for years to come.
As a final sort of “egg in your beer,” the Democrats had 28 governors to the Republicans’ 22 in 2009. Today there are 31
Republican governors, 18 Democrats and one “other” Bill Walker (I) in Alaska. With solid control of both houses and the
governorships of so many states, a united Republican Party could do almost anything it wants to do if it has the will to do it,
and, at the state level, the party is following through.

While by no means perfect, there is clearly a close correlation between a party’s success in state and local elections, and that
party’s success in the upcoming presidential election. If that close correlation holds in November of 2016, there will be a
Republican landslide.

In fact the entire political terrain of the U.S. has shifted 180 degrees in the past 8 years with one exception—the White House.
A betting person with any lick of sense would be loath to bet against a Republican presidency and a radical reversal of
economic policies.
VI. Issues and Political History
Another factor favoring Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton has to do with longevity and negative selection. The political
process, more than any system I’ve ever worked with, thrives on pointing out mistakes and overlooking successes. My advice
to many candidates has been to speak as little as possible and to describe policies in as general a manner as you can get
away with. People aren’t looking through your transcripts to find the next wonderful and positive thing you’ve done, but instead
they try to find your missteps, transgressions, faux pas and failures. Politics is a totally negative process. You live or die by
the sum total of what you’ve done wrong, not on the balance between what you’ve done right and what you’ve done wrong.
In the words of Shakespeare, “the good is oft interred with their bones.” 6
Trump has had very limited exposure as a practicing politician and, therefore, has only his own words and phrases to criticize.
While he may have a number of missteps in business or in his personal life, no one cares. And yet, he truly enjoys celebrity
status as no one in politics today does. Also, given how much Trump has said about any number of issues over the past couple
of years, there are probably quotes that can be used on any side of most any issue. But with Hillary, it’s different.
Hillary has done a lot. She’s been involved in politics at a visible level since the Watergate hearings and maybe even earlier.
Her past contains numerous misdeeds and failures as much because she’s done so much and perhaps not so much because
she has been a failure. Yet, a diligent, hard-driving researcher can find a laundry list of her significant misdeeds.
To wit,
� As events have unfolded, her vote in favor of the Iraq War is a clear sign of poor political judgment, especially in her party.
� Her behavior surrounding the attack on the consulate in Benghazi and the failure to respond to four American deaths sure
looks like a case of poor judgment.
� Her use of a private e-mail server while Secretary of State and thus the potential exposure of critical U.S. intelligence to
those who would do us harm again smacks of poor judgement.
� The Clinton Foundation along with its big gifts and extraordinarily large speaking fees surely creates an aura of impropriety,
favoritism and the absence of sound judgement.
� Her involvement in the cover-up of Fast and Furious is transparent bad judgment.
� Her disregard for coal miners and coal companies in her reckless quest to be seen as a defender of the environment is yet
another case of dangerous judgement.
� The IRS scandal: While not directly implicated as a participant in an administration cover-up of the Cincinnati IRS office
headed by Lois Lerner’s misuse of government power, there are definite indications of her gross negligence in the pursuit
of even-handed fairness of the power to tax.
� As I have predicted, 7 Obamacare has not only driven considerable premium increases for coverage since 2013, when the
marketplace first opened for enrollment, but has also added significant cost burdens onto health insurance companies,
many of whom are choosing to leave the Obamacare marketplace as costs continue to outpace profits. This has led to
entire states, such as Alaska and Alabama, being left with only one insurer on their respective Obamacare marketplaces,
with 650 counties total being left with just one insurer in 2017. 8
� Her personal investments in cattle futures. 9 In the late 1970s, she turned an initial investment of $1,000 into $100,000 in
just 10 months, despite having no previous investment experience. Her close friend, James Blair, an experienced
commodities trader, advised her to enter the commodities market, but Clinton claimed to have made her own investment
decisions. One academic study published in The Journal of Economics and Finance estimated the likelihood of achieving
a result such as Clinton’s as 1 in 31 trillion. 10
