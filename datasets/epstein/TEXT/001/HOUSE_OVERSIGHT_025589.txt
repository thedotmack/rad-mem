yes Alan i think you are 
; Ms. Yvette Robbins 
; Alex.Family Pines 
; Jim 
you are referring to duplication of a gene—there are many such genes including those produced by 
retrotransposons (as evidenced by lack of introns)—where a gene has two separate effects and there is an 
advantage to having a gene with each effect you will often prefer two genes to one, because of less interference 
in fitness effects 
Peter was talking about a gene with a single effect—sickling—and the other allele is the normal one—the 
heterozygote destroys malaria within red blood cells at trivial cost and there is no cost at all if malaria is not 
present—by contrast homozygous sickle individuals suffer lifetime effects 
Peter was trying to conjure up a heterozygote that propagated asexually but this requires a chiasma between 
neighbouring genes, a very rare event and hence it usually leads rapidly to mutational decay of one of the two 
copies, i.e. so-called pseudogenes, of which there are many in our genome

I haven't read whatever Pete wrote, but if I understand Bob correctly, 
Pete must be talking about subfunctionalization:

If so, it's not a radical suggestion. It's thought to be the process that 
gave rise to all multi-gene families. Michael Lynch discusses it in his 
book, The Origin of Genome Architecture. 
Am I missing something?

here is my latest and final comment on Peter Richerson's comments on Gordon's idea about Trump being a 
narcissistic psychopath—a view with which i firmly agree 
i have learned a lot by thinking through all of Peter's argumentation but i have not learned much that 
contradicts either my biases nor reality herself 
all best wishes

Friends and Family, 
Here's my latest on free growth theory. Tell me if I'm making any progress in my old intelligibility deficit. 
I'm also working on a new version without math.
