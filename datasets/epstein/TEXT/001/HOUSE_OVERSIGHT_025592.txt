Caroline Kennedy Selling 93 Acres on Martha's Vineyard 
Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of the late President John F. Kennedy, listed for sale about 90 acres 
of land in Martha's Vineyard, a resort island off the Massachusetts coast. 
Two waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property 
available for $20 million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the listings for 6 Red Gate Farm 
and 8 Red Gate Farm. 
"An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of Squibnocket Pond, with further views over 
towering sand dunes to the Atlantic Ocean," the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads. "Plenty of privacy with 
varied topography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate." 
The land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1978, 
said John O'Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in Edgartown, Massachusetts. 
The property is "a piece of the island that very few people have seen," said O'Connell, who isn't involved in 
the sale. 
Corporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person 
responsible for the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is expected to be Obama's choice as 
the next U.S. ambassador to Japan.
