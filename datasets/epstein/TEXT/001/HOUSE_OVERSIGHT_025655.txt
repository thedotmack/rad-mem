Search for next FBI director moves ahead quickly 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions interviewed eight candidates to replace fired FBI Director James 
Comey on Saturday, with President Donald Trump indicating that the nomination could be announced 
by Friday when he leaves for his first foreign trip. Potential replacements include FBI special agent 
Adam Lee, Judge Michael Garcia and former Justice Department employee Alice Fisher, who would 
be the first female director.

THE BUSINESS & POLITICS POLL 
What's your take on the Comey firing 
President Donald Trump's sudden firing of FBI Director James Comey has stirred a flurry of calls for 
an independent investigation of the event and the FBI's probe into possible collusion between Trump's 
campaign and Russian officials. Critics say the president's action was a deliberate attempt to derail in 
FBI investigation, while defenders say the president acted properly and Comey deserved to be 
fired.This week's question: What's your take on the Comey firing? Cast your vote below. We'll 
post the results Friday. 
The president acted properly and within his powers 
The firing was legal but badly handled 
The firing could be seen as obstructing justice 
The firing was definitely an obstruction of justice

Senators including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Sunday that if President 
Donald Trump recorded conversations with former FBI Director James Comey, 
he should provide those recordings to lawmakers. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-

special prosecutor is appointed to investigate potential connections between 
Trump and Russia.

Carl Bialik took $100 to a currency exchange to see how many transactions he 
could make between different currencies before running out of money. Most 
exchanges require you to convert back to US dollars before going into another 
foreign currency, which led to significant fees when buying dollars with less 
popular currencies.
