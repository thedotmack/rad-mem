What is Blockchain Technology?
Investment
Management
Division
Illustrative Schematic: Centralized Network versus Distributed Network
Centralized Network
Distributed Network
• Blockchain is the critical and differentiating infrastructure that underlies cryptocurrencies.
• Unlike most networks today, which rely on a centralized hub, a blockchain is a public distributed network whose
complete database can be accessed and maintained by each member of the network.
• The blockchain is a shared and continually reconciled database. As new transactions occur, data is quickly
disseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.
• Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.

Common Features of Cryptocurrencies
Common Features of
Cryptocurrencies
� Digital
Attributes
• Coin ownership is represented by entries on a digital
ledger, not by a physical token.
� Decentralization • No single entity controls the currency.
� Open Source • All source code is available freely online.
� Distributed
Consensus
� Pseudonymity
� Cryptography
(computerized encoding)
• Each cryptocurrency uses a method for obtaining
consensus on ownership without a central arbiter.
• Coin ownership is not linked to real-world identities
within the blockchain.
• Several cryptographic techniques are used to verify
transactions, protect identities, and limit supply.
• A cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital coin. It allows users to make transactions and store money in a secure and
pseudonymous manner.
• All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded chronologically on a blockchain, which acts as the critical infrastructure
underlying a cryptocurrency.
• The process of verifying transactions and ensuring the validity of the blockchain is called “mining.”
• Mining solves the “double-spending” problem that had plagued previous attempts to implement a digital currency.

1) Before sending any bitcoins, Bob must hold bitcoins
in his wallet from a previous transaction (or by
solving a block to earn the mining reward).
2) Bob creates a new transaction in which he pays 0.5
BTC (of his 1 BTC) to Alice.
3) Bob broadcasts this transaction to the network for
validation and inclusion in the blockchain.

1) Miner B happens to be the first to solve this block
and adds it to the blockchain. Miner B collects 12.5-
bitcoin reward.
2) If Bob’s transaction is included the block, Alice
becomes the owner of 0.5 BTC, which will register
in her wallet.
• Consensus transaction validation creates a book of record for all transactions that have ever occurred.
– Transactions may only occur if they are supported by evidence from previous transactions.
– To send bitcoins, an owner’s wallet uses its private key to prove ownership of the referenced bitcoins.
• Transaction processing typically take 10-20 minutes, but can take up to 18 hours if the network is congested.

What is Mining?

• Miners use highly specialized computers designed to run an algorithm that attempts to solve a cryptographic puzzle in order
to add a new block on the blockchain. By design, a bitcoin block is created once every ten minutes.
• The computing power required to solve the cryptographic puzzle is high and expensive; bitcoin mining consumes an
estimated $1.3bn worth of electricity annually 1 —equivalent to Ireland’s annual electricity consumption.
• In order to incentivize mining, the first miner to complete a block is rewarded 12.5 bitcoins. The global supply of bitcoins is
capped at 21mil (currently ~16.5m) and follows a predetermined growth rate—the miners’ rewards halve every four years.
• Given ~1-1.5m mining units globally, the likelihood of any one miner solving a block is low. Many miners join “mining
pools,” which are cooperatives which share block rewards proportionate to contributed mining power.
– Mining pools are highly concentrated; the top four pools represent over 50% of total mining power.

• New blockchain-related projects are funded via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This process raises capital through token sales.
• In an ICO, the object offered is either a new digital coin or a yet-undeveloped concept in search of funding. ICO investors
purchase an ownership percentage of a future money supply or functionality.
• While many ICOs support legitimate use cases, Autonomous Research asserts, “unfortunately, many ICOs are fraudulent.” 1
• Rather than raising fiat currency, ICOs primarily raise capital in the form of Bitcoin and Ether, driving additional demand for
the cryptocurrencies.

• In addition to speculation, which has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrency appreciation, other drivers include:
• Perceived Scarcity: Bitcoin’s 21 million token cap is expected to be reached in 2140 (16.5 million today). Many of the
over 2,000 other cryptocurrencies, however, do not have a capped supply. Further, while unlikely, bitcoin’s token cap
could be raised if a consensus of programmers decided so.
• Desired Safe-haven: Increased global participation reflects desire for an asset independent from governments or central
banks (“digital gold”). Many governments from which investors have sought diversification, however, have recently
banned domestic crypto-exchanges.

As Bitcoin Ownership is Not Anonymous, Illicit Use has Fallen
Investment
Management

Larry Fink on Bitcoin’s Illicit Use
"Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money
laundering there is in the world. That’s all it is. It’s an
index of money laundering.”
– BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, October 13, 2017
• Because bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, users’ real-world identities are ascertainable once the individual
converts bitcoin to fiat currency.
• Digital intelligence companies continually scan the blockchain to identify suspicious transaction activity.
• The Blockchain Intelligence Group estimates that illegal transactions in bitcoin fell from ~50% of total volume in 2015
to ~20% in 2016, and represent “significantly less than that” today.
• As law enforcement has become better able to track bitcoin ransom, cybercriminals have begun to favor currencies that
allow anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash, and even Ether.

Sovereign Currencies Meet Three Criteria
Investment
Management
Division
1) They are used as a medium of exchange.
– To represent a medium of exchange, an instrument must facilitate the transaction
of goods or services between parities (US$ are used to buy a barrel of oil).
2) They serve as unit of account.
– A unit of account is a measurement which allows value to be accounted and
compared (a barrel of WTI is worth ~$55).
3) They are a store of value.
– A store of value is an asset that can be saved, stored, and exchanged in the future
for a predictable stable value (with 2% annual inflation, a nominal dollar today
will be worth 82¢ in 10 years).

• Processing is expensive. The average transaction cost is ~$3.40, rendering transfer of small fund balances uneconomical.
• Processing is slow. Transaction processing typically takes a minimum of 10-20 minutes, but can take up to 18 hours if
the network is congested (Visa and Mastercard authorize transactions in ~20 milliseconds).
• Bitcoin is not broadly accepted. A mere 9k merchants accept bitcoin, compared to the 37mil that accept Visa and
MasterCard, and the billions of merchants and people globally that accept US dollars. 1
• Further, the IRS considers all cryptocurrency gains a taxable event (including for de minimis purchases).

• Bitcoin’s rapid appreciation makes it an unsatisfactory candidate as a unit of account.
• In January, one could have purchased a dishwasher for one bitcoin. Today, it would cost 1/6 th a bitcoin to buy the
unit, implying severe deflation over the past several months.
• In deflationary environments, people hoard their money in order to buy goods more cheaply at a later date, which has
prompted most people to hoard their bitcoin.

• Bitcoin’s annualized volatility of 95% dwarfs even the most volatile of EM currencies.
• Bitcoin’s volatility is 8x the volatility of US equities. In terms of both count and magnitude, Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple have all
experienced more severe drawdowns over their short histories than the S&P 500 has since 1945.
• Bitcoin exchanges have thin liquidity, which plays a role in driving enormous price movement—so far to the upside, but which
could cause a flash crash upon a large sell order. A ~$30 million sell order would likely move the market by 5%.
• A store of value should predictably preserve wealth. Bitcoin is unable to do so, as it neither generates income nor grows with
earnings.

– Bitcoin’s slow transaction time precipitated its recent “hard fork” in attempt to enhance processing capacity.
• Whereas traditional payment processors’ market cap represents ~3% of their transaction volume, Bitcoin’s represents
97%, suggesting its valuation is dislocated from its fundamental value and that speculation has driven its price.

• Although cryptocurrencies cannot be spent without control of the corresponding private keys, care must be taken to
protect those private keys. Many bitcoin owners allow exchanges to custody their private keys, which leaves them
vulnerable:
– If hackers are able to access owners’ private keys, they can deplete owners’ digital wallets.
– As of August 2016, Reuters reported that a third of bitcoin exchanges had been hacked. 1
– Ethereum’s recent Parity hack is the first time a coding error has resulted in a loss of funds.
• Estimates vary but suggest that hackers have stolen at least several hundred million dollars of cryptocurrencies.

Central Bank Cryptocurrencies Could Substantially Reduce Fraud

“Say there’s a grant to Nigeria for health stuff—if it’s digital money, they can track that it
was paid to a certain person and when it was paid out. Then you can audit later and say,
‘Did that really happen?’ You don’t want to tell donors that three percent went astray. Now
that there’s digital traceability in a place like Nigeria, where corruption is a huge problem,
we can bring that down. A lot of the optimism we have at the foundation about disease,
education and financial services is because we’re sitting on top of a digital miracle.”

• Blockchain technology, which underlies cryptocurrencies, is revolutionary, and likely
to have many applications.
• Cryptocurrencies are currently too volatile to be a medium of exchange, unit of
account, or store of value, and have many vulnerabilities.
• The cryptocurrency ecosystem will evolve substantially over time.
• The current incarnation of cryptocurrencies is unlikely to persist, but we expect
central bank digital currencies to prevail.

Investor for the purposes of section 708 of the Corporations Act of Australia; and the person is a wholesale client for the purpose of section 761G of the Corporations Act of

provide in Australia. GSCo is authorized and regulated by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission under US laws; GSALLC is regulated by the Hong Kong Securities
and Futures Commission under Hong Kong laws; and GSI is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority.
Investment Risks. Risks vary by the type of investment. For example, investments that involve futures, equity swaps, and other derivatives, as well as non-investment
grade securities, give rise to substantial risk and are not available to or suitable for all investors. We have described some of the risks associated with certain investments
below. Additional information regarding risks may be available in the materials provided in connection with specific investments. You should not enter into a transaction or
make an investment unless you understand the terms of the transaction or investment and the nature and extent of the associated risks. You should also be satisfied that
the investment is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial condition.
• Money Market Funds. Investments in money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
government agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by
investing in money market funds.
• U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / ETFs or Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs). A Prospectus and, if available, a summary prospectus for the applicable
mutual fund, ETF or ETN containing more information may be obtained from your Private Wealth Management team. Please consider a fund's
investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses, and read the summary prospectus or the Prospectus carefully before investing, as they contain
this and other information about the mutual fund.
31
Important Information
Investment
Management
Division
You may obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your Private Wealth Management
team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly
redeemable by the fund.
You should understand the risks associated with leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs or commodities futures-linked ETFs before investing. These types of securities may
experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver
multiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time
can vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may
be magnified in a volatile market. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into
and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future
prices for the underlying commodity. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.
• Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor’s capital and the use of leverage,
and therefore may not be appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments structured as private investment
funds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. Investors in private investment funds should review the Offering
Memorandum, the Subscription Agreement and any other applicable disclosures for risks and potential conflicts of interest. Terms and conditions governing private
investments are contained in the applicable offering documents, which also include information regarding the liquidity of such investments, which may be limited.
• Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. Investing in the securities of issuers in emerging markets and growth markets involves certain considerations, including:
political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in
such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility.
• Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk, which means that the value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects of
individual companies, particular industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risks than
those associated with larger, more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.
• Fixed Income. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and interest rate
risk. Any guarantee on an investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.
• Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involve the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information, less liquidity
and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in
securities such as ADRs/GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.
• Real Estate. Investments in real estate involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes, such as sensitivities to temporary or permanent
reductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented. Real estate investments (both through public and private markets) are also subject to changes in
broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates.
• Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk
of the issuer or guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often
perform differently from the asset(s) they reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the
structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you
may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference
asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.

Important Information

Options. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options
is potentially unlimited. Please ensure that you have read and understood the current options disclosure document before entering into any standardized options
transactions. The booklet entitled Characteristic and Risk of Standardized Options can be obtained from our sales representatives or at
http://www.theocc.com/components/docs/riskstoc.pdf. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such
as spreads. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other information will be supplied upon request.
• Buying Options - Investors who buy call (put) options risk loss of the entire premium paid if the underlying security finishes below (above) the strike price at
expiration.
• Selling Options - Investors who sell puts risk loss of the strike price less the premium received for selling the put.
OTC Derivatives. To understand clearly the terms and conditions of any OTC derivative transaction you may enter into, you should carefully review the Master Agreement,
including any related schedules, credit support documents, addenda and exhibits. You may be requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal
policies of Goldman Sachs to support written OTC derivatives.
Prior to entering into an OTC derivative transaction you should be aware of the below general risks associated with OTC derivative transactions:
– Liquidity Risk: There is no public market for OTC derivative transactions and, therefore, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position on
favorable terms.
– Risk of Inability to Assign: OTC derivative transactions entered into with one or more affiliates of Goldman Sachs cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred
without Goldman Sachs’ prior written consent and, therefore, it may be impossible for you to transfer any OTC derivative transaction to a third party.
– Counterparty Credit Risk: Because Goldman Sachs may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you
must evaluate the credit risk of doing business with Goldman Sachs. Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, a
registered U.S. broker-dealer, or other affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. As a broker dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is subject to net capital, financial responsibility rules, and other regulatory requirements designed to protect customer assets.
Other subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may not be registered as a U.S. broker dealer and therefore are not be subject to similar SEC regulation.
– Pricing and Valuation: The price of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between Goldman Sachs and each counterparty and Goldman Sachs
does not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available. You may therefore have trouble establishing
whether the price you have been offered for a particular OTC derivative transaction is fair. OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level
inferred from interest rates, dividends and the underlyer. The difference may be due to factors including, but not limited to, expectations of future levels of interest
rates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlyer prior to maturity. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable
factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.
– Early Termination Payments: The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or Goldman Sachs
may be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of
termination.
– Indexes: Goldman Sachs does not warrant, and takes no responsibility for, the structure, method of computation or publication of any currency exchange rates,
interest rates, indexes of such rates, or credit, equity or other indexes, unless Goldman Sachs specifically advises you otherwise.
