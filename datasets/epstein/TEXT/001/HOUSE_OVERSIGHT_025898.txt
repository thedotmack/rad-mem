Hi Jeff 
As of now we plan to be in NY around August 25. We plan to work on my biography with the editor. Probably 
starting Sept 1st. But it's all flexible till Sept 11 and on, when I have my speeches and other events.

Hi Jeff 
I really find it amusing. I don't agree with everything he says. But it is fascinating. BB is making "historic 
mistakes"(as he likes to blame others) both vis-a-vis Obama as well as in regard to the American Jewry. And 
causes a direct damage to IL. 
Noam is so sharp and focused. Really impressive. 
I did not fully understand how the fallacy he sees in the attitude to the Ants example is related to Big Data 
illusions. An area (deep learning) I spent some time recently trying to better penetrate. 
Btw, the series of cubic differences should look 7,19,37,61 (not 21). 
We greatly enjoyed staying in 62nd. 
We plan to be back in the last week of Aug. for several weeks (having some speeches to make) 
will you still be in NM? 
If positive we might come over for few days. 
PI let us know. 
Best 
From Nil as well.

Neat indeed. 
I'm writing about the Iran deal. So far have only sent a form paragraph in response to requests. Below. 
Noam 
On Iran, as usual, I'm a gloomy contrarian. I'm glad the treaty was signed, and it's kind of fun to watch the 
Republican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone 
well beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is "the 
greatest threat to world peace", intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such 
a thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to 
world peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The 
American population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an 
organization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all 
quite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a 
small fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If— a big If— it has plans for 
nuclear weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a 
deterrent strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don't want any 
impediment: the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of 
nuclear weapons would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere 
(over US objections). That's been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support, 
including Iran. It comes up regularly at the 5-year review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN, 
again a few months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge 
nuclear weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the Free 
Press (though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same 
with the rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I'm wondering 
whether to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It's like talking to a wall. Iran has an awful 
government, though by the standards of such US allies as Saudi Arabia, it's practically heaven. 
Nevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum. 
Noam

What you suggest is very much the model that has been current in the behavioral sciences for many years. It has a 
record of colossal failure, and for good reasons, I think. It's disproven, but keeps coming back, most recently with Big 
Data illusions. 
A child doesn't grow arms and legs rather than wings, or a mammalian vs insect visual system, the way an ant 
searches for food. Rather, the path of development is sharply restricted (and evolution follows constraints 
too). Acquisition of language (and other cognitive achievements) seems very much like physical growth. 
Highly contentious in the field, but in my opinion that's a comment on the failures of the field.

Appreciate the invitation, but leisure time? Is that an English phrase? 
OK for ants, but don't see how it helps us.

ants find the shortest route to food, by trying many and discarding what doesn't work, no algorithm. , no
