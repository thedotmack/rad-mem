Hi Steve, 
I am still intrigued and would like to meet Michael. I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more 
specific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, 
but as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition 
to being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. 
I hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump! 
Best, 
Kathy

I don't want to pester you, but in the hope that you are still intrigued, I wanted to suggest that we try to set up an 
opportunity for you to meet Michael Davison, our global head of litigation. MIchael is an International 
Arbitration specialist based in London and a key player. He is also a lot of fun, notwithstanding his Scottish 
upbringing. 
Let me know.
