We will of course do this in whatever sequence makes sense for you. It goes without saying that any move 
would need to make economic sense. My assumption has been that your comp would fall outside of our "bell 
curve", but that is not an issue for us as long as the potential contribution also falls outside. You would not be 
the only partner outside the curve, and I am comfortable with expanding that group for people who can 
genuinely move the needle while embracing the culture that makes us who we are. 
One benefit of having Michael in the mix is that he can provide a global perspective, and he would be important 
for explaining the case outside the US if we moved forward. 
Just let me know when and how you want to speak next. 
Best, 
Steve

Hi Steve, 
I am still intrigued and would like to meet Michael. I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more 
specific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, 
but as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition 
to being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. 
I hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump! 
Best, 
Kathy

I don't want to pester you, but in the hope that you are still intrigued, I wanted to suggest that we try to set up an 
opportunity for you to meet Michael Davison, our global head of litigation. MIchael is an International 
Arbitration specialist based in London and a key player. He is also a lot of fun, notwithstanding his Scottish 
upbringing. 
Let me know. 
Best, 
Steve
