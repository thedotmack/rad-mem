I openly and proudly support Trump. 
I've actually been able to pull people away from Hillary by saying I'd ONLY vote for Trump or Sanders. 
Citing they everyone else is establishment politics. I convinced a lesbian woman, older, to consider Trump 
after she went on a rampage about him. It just shows, people HAVE NO IDEA what they are talking about. 
Media holds the cards.... people are sheep.

SUBJECT; GINGRICH VIEW OF TRUMP 
Understanding Donald Trump The Washington Times January 8, 2016 by Newt Gingrich 
Donald Trump is a genuine phenomenon. He may or may not become the Republican nominee for 
president. He may or may not win the presidency even if he becomes the nominee. Yet it is clear that he is a 
phenomenon and that any history of the 2016 presidential race will have to spend a good bit of time 
analyzing Trump and his impact. 
» 
>> From the time he announced on June 16, Trump has dominated social and mainstream media. He 
dominates the conversation despite the lack of paid advertising. Trump says outrageous things and his 
supporters shrug it off. At every turn, his poll numbers continue to rise. 
» 
>> As a step toward understanding this amazing performance, I spent part of the Christmas break reading his 
first bestseller, 'The Art of the Deal'. Written in 1987, this book is a classic among American business 
books and has influenced a generation of entrepreneurs. Trump wrote 'The Art of the Deal' when he was 41 
years old and having a successful run. The book's popularity contributed to Time Magazine's decision to 
feature Donald Trump on its cover in January 1989. 
» 
>> The portrait that emerges from this easy-to-read and remarkably interesting book is of an aggressive, 
ambitious person who is constantly pushing, constantly learning, and always seeking the next 
challenge. Reporters and analysts who are trying to understand Trump would be well served by slowing 
down and reading this nearly three-decade-old bestseller. 
» 
>> They would discover that Donald Trump has developed a remarkable set of rules and principles that 
allow him to make decisions with incredible speed. Trump knows a lot, but what is amazing is how rapidly 
he figures out what he doesn't know. 
» 
>> My favorite story is of the Wollman Skating Rink in New York's Central Park. 
>> The Wollman Rink was a heavily used public skating rink which had fallen into disrepair in 1980. New 
York City tried for six years to fix it, spent $13 million, and the rink still was not ready to open. In June of 
1986 Trump, who could see the rink from his apartment, finally got tired of the embarrassment and offered 
to fix the rink at his own expense. At first the city turned him down because its bureaucracy did not want to 
be embarrassed by someone fixing something they couldn't fix. Trump kept pushing and finally out of 
embarrassment the city gave in. 
» 
>> The key part of the story is Trump's reaction to being put in charge. He promptly recognized that he 
didn't know anything about fixing a skating rink. He asked himself who built a lot of skating rinks. 
"Canadians!" he concluded. He found the best Canadian ice skating rink construction company. When the 
Canadians flew in to assess the situation, they were amazed at how bad the city had been at solving the 
problem. They assured Trump that this was an easy job. Trump fixed the six year embarrassment two 
months ahead of schedule and nearly $800,000 under-budget. (The city did end up paying for the work, and 
Trump donated the profits to charity.)

>> After reading this chapter you begin to think that maybe Donald Trump really could build a wall along 
our southern border for a lot less than our current government estimates. 
» 
>> 'The Art of the Deal' is filled with stories like this — stories of common sense stories of calculated risk 
taking, and stories of innovation and marketing. 
>> Anyone who would like to better understand Donald Trump would be helped by reading this remarkable 
book. 
» 
>> Another is his pledges and I have no way of knowing if he will make good on all of them but I do agree 
with all of them. Trump is the only candidate that is serious about building The Wall" ! Two other 
important pledges Trump has made that no other candidate of either party has matched! First deportation of 
millions of illegals that are demanding and costing American taxpayers billions of dollars and 
second Closing 34 Muslim traing Camps throughout our country! I WOULD LIKE TRUMP OR ANY 
OTHER CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO REINSTATE ANY AND ALL MILITARY OFFICERS 
DISCHARGED BECAUSE THEY DISAGREED WITH OBAMA OR HIS POLICIES!! 
» 
>> Here is another that kind of wraps up my feelings about Trump 
>> Raccoon's in your basement! An interesting analogy 
>> You've been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with 
raccoon's. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoon's have overtaken your basement. You want them gone 
immediately so you hire a guy. A pro. You don't care if the guy smells, you need those raccoon's gone 
pronto and he's the guy to do it! You don't care if the guy swears, you don't care if he's an alcoholic, you 
don't care how many times he's been married, you don't care if he voted for Obama, you don't care if he has 
plumber's crack...you simply want those raccoon's gone! 
» 
>> You want your problem fixed! He's the guy. He's the best. Period. That's why Trump. Yes he's a bit of 
an ass, yes he's an egomaniac, but you don't care. 
>> The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two-faced & gutless, illegal's are 
everywhere. You want it all fixed! You don't care that Trump is crude, you don't care that he insults people, 
you don't care that he had been friendly with Hillary, you don't care that he has changed positions, you don't 
care that he's been married 3 times, you don't care that he fights with Megyn Kelly and Rosie 
O'Donnell, you don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslin terrorist,...this country is weak, 
bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegal's, we are becoming a nation of 
victims where every Tom, Ricardo and Hamad is a special interest group with special rights 
>> to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in; "AND WE JUST 
WANT IT FIXED" and Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. 
» 
>> You're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and sick of illegal's. You just 
want this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but doesn't have any lobbyist money influencing him, he 
doesn't have political correctness restraining him, all you know is that he has been very successful, a good 
negotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he's also not a politician, so he's not a cowardly politician. And he 
says he'll fix it. You don't care if the guy has bad hair. You just want those raccoon's gone. Out of your 
house! 
» 
>> This one is more about why we don't want Hillary. 
>> I think this sums it up well ! 
>> Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a bar. Donald leans over, and with a smile on his face, says, 
"The media are really tearing you apart for That Scandal."
