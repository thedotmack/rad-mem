Biden? Thanks

Bruce — thought of you when watching the evening news yesterday. Joe Biden was being interviewed about his work on 
"Cancer Moonshot" or something like that. He said that they were working on or planned to work on a database/app 
that has never before been done, that would allow a patient or a physician to see who was doing research on a specific 
tumor anywhere in the world. 
You've already got it. You have connections everywhere, you should get to Biden on that work group.
