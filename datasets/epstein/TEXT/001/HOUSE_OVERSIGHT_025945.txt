This is Aaron's website not an app it allows anyone to type in any cancer term and find any clinical trial or 
researcher worldwide. It is updated every 24 hours and is in process of being updated with additional 
information for the benefit of patients and researchers. We allow it as a free open platform that can be 
expanded to specific interests. If for instance you type in glioblastoma and go out 10,000 miles from your 
location you can see researchers and clinical trials worldwide. Look at the map then press for example 
Germany and see what is available.
