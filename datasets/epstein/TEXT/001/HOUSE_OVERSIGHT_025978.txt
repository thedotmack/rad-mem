Quantifying the (bond-equity correlation) risks to risk parity
Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs renewed concerns of forced selling by risk parity
funds. While the drawdowns in US Treasuries, US equities, and ultimately risk parity
portfolios were small and short-lived, the latent risk remains worth monitoring, as (i)
leverage is still near max levels across a variety of risk parity parametrizations, (ii) bond
allocations are historically elevated, and (iii) markets continue to be sceptical of a 2016
Fed hike. Hence we provide a simple scenario tool to help investors assess what relative
moves in bonds and equities could catalyse significant deleveraging by rules-based risk
parity funds running vol target overlays. For example, a -2% daily decline in the S&P
500 coupled with a -0.6% fall in 10y Treasury prices (poor diversification) could trigger a
25% deleveraging (of unlevered notional) today, whereas a -4% SPX drop and +1% bond
rally (good diversification) would generate no selling pressure, underscoring the critical
role played by bond-equity correlation in governing the severity of risk parity unwinds.
Europe
Buy the seasonal oil dip via bullish X-market risk reversals
Selling rich USO (WTI tracker) 3M 25d puts to fund cheaper SXEP (European Oil & Gas
equity) calls is historically attractive. Indeed the number (>2) of long SXEP calls per short
USO put is in the 90 th %-ile since 2008. The trade leverages both our commodity
strategists’ ‘buy the dip’ view and our equity strategists’ bullish outlook on the Oil & Gas
sector, which has been the worst performing over the last 1M. Moreover, the average
payoff of being long SXEP 3M 25d calls would have been >2x greater than USO 3M 25d
calls (owing to more frequent positive returns), when sized for the same upfront cost.
Asia
Own NKY Sep/Oct calendar call at vol hit YTD low level going into the Sep BOJ
Post the Jul-16 BoJ and the announcement of a ¥28.1tn fiscal stimulus package, NKY and
USDJPY 1M vols have dropped to near YTD low levels, both USDJPY and NKY 2M-1M
term structures are historically steep, pricing in a slow summer. Our strategists believe
Sep-16 BoJ’s will likely create uncertainty, however, NKY Sep-Oct ATM fwd vol currently
trades at the low end of its trading range going into BoJ’s YTD. Plus, our analysis
suggests a further squeeze in yield will likely be positive for the NKY. We recommend
buying 1x NKY Oct 17500 call vs. selling 0.65x Sep 17250 call.
Trade update: Closing the NKY Aug/Sep put calendar trade at 0.28% premium
Korean auto-callable issuance slightly rose while NKY Uridashi issuance fell in July

BofAML GFSI TM X-Asset Risk Landscape
GFSI makes new YTD lows as BoE & NFP boost risk assets
The GFSI declined to a new YTD low of 0.18 as of 5-Aug, a level not seen since Nov-15.
With the BoE surprising to the upside in terms of cutting rates, re-starting QE and
guiding towards more accommodative policy down the line, as well as better than
expected US non-farm payrolls, risk assets globally got a boost.
• Credit experienced the biggest decline in stress across assets: Chart 3
shows that credit (followed by equities) experienced the biggest weekly stress
decline. Indeed, Chart 5 and Chart 6 show that sovereign risk as measured by IG
& sub-IG foreign sovereign bond spreads experienced the most significant
weekly declines in stress versus their history in the GFSI.
• Europe continues to be most stressed region: Chart 4 shows that Europe is
the most stressed region in the GFSI, despite the stress declines last week. USrelated
stresses which were already relatively lower vs the other regions, were
more resilient. Indeed the only significant move higher in regional stress was in
USD Libor-OIS spreads (Chart 5), which our Rates strategists view as driven by
the anticipation of US money market mutual fund reform in October.

The GFSI Risk Allocator favours being underweight risk assets given the distribution of
stresses within the GFSI. The percentages of Bullish, Bearish and Neutral GFSI
components (as used in the Risk Allocator) were 8.7%, 13.0% & 78.3%, respectively as
of 5-Aug. The Risk Allocator (using Bull, Bear & Neutral weights of 2, 0, 1) suggests
reducing the underweight position to 4.3% UW from last week’s 17.4% UW.

Volatility in the US
Quantifying the (bond-equity correl) risks to risk parity
Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs (Chart 7) following the BoJ’s decision not to cut rates
renewed investor fears of forced selling by risk parity funds. However, the spill-over
into US Treasuries was relatively muted (Chart 7), and coupled with a small and fleeting
drawdown in US equities, risk parity portfolio volatility failed to rise materially (Chart 8).
Consequently, risk parity funds were likely forced to unwind little to none of their
leverage last week and remain near max leverage levels (Chart 9).
For this very reason, the latent risk in this corner of the quant fund space remains worth
monitoring. Furthermore, as we noted post-Brexit, fixed income allocations within risk
parity funds are historically elevated today. And with federal-funds futures markets
implying a ~25% chance of a Sep rate hike and less than a 50% probability of a Dec
hike, bond markets may be surprised by a 2016 Fed hike.

Monitoring relative equity/bond moves for potential risk parity deleveraging
It is intuitive to think that rising volatility corresponds to an increase in model-driven
selling pressure from risk parity strategies. However, what’s less appreciated in our
view is the impact on risk parity allocations as a result of the relative dynamics
between component volatilities and correlation. For example, through the close on the
Monday post-Brexit (27-Jun-16), S&P 500 volatility rose from 9.6% two days prior to
17.9% (increase of 1.9x) while 10-Year US Treasury Futures return volatility rose 4.3%
to 6.6% (increase of 1.5x). Despite these outsized vol moves, in a recent report we
showed that owing to the diversification (increasingly negative correlation) between
equities and bonds, unlevered risk parity portfolio volatility remained stable and hence,
target vol overlays were less likely to be subject to model-driven selling.
Given low levels of realized volatility across asset classes, it’s also intuitive to expect
continued elevated levels of leverage in risk parity products. To the extent that the
leverage is via vol control overlays, there are reasonable concerns on the potential
market impact should these model-driven investments be forced to simultaneously
deleverage. To that end, we provide a simple scenario tool (Chart 10) to help investors
assess what relative moves in the S&P 500 and 10-year US Treasury futures could
catalyze significant deleveraging by rules-based, vol-controlled risk parity funds.
4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016
Importantly, this scenario tool is a function of (1) current unlevered risk parity volatility,
(2) current risk parity component weights, and (3) the maximum leverage of the target
volatility overlay. For simplicity, we used only a two asset risk parity portfolio of equity
and fixed income applied to the S&P 500 and 10-Year US Treasury Futures.

income risk parity portfolio with an 8% target volatility overlay and 2x max leverage cap

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Data as of 5-Aug-16. Equity and fixed income components within the theoretical risk parity
investment are represented by S&P 500 total return and 10-Year US Treasury Futures total return. Risk parity allocations are determined
monthly and rebalanced using prior 12-month realized volatility. Unlevered portfolio volatility for determining target volatility leverage
measured using EWMA with lambda equal to 0.94.
For example, last Friday 10-Year US Treasury futures declined about 60bps. Had the
S&P 500 declined 2.0%, we would have expected about 25% of the unlevered notional
of a model 8% vol-targeted, 2.0x max leverage risk parity portfolio to deleverage. The
S&P 500 was in fact up 86bps on a total return basis which according to the tool falls in
the region of no deleveraging.
Also, to put recent events in perspective, we plotted on the scenario tool the respective
moves in the S&P 500 and 10-Year US Treasury futures during the Taper Tantrum (19-
Jun-2013), the Aug-15 risk flare (24-Aug-15), and post-Brexit (24-Jun-2016). Note, for
an accurate assessment through those events, we would also need to reconfigure the
scenario tool for the respective unlevered risk parity volatility and risk parity component
weights on those dates. However, with current measures for both, the tool does
estimate current deleveraging flows should we see similar equity and bond moves today.
Interestingly, equity/bond moves through the Aug-15 risk flare would not cause a
deleveraging today. The reason is bonds have increased in allocation since last August
(78% vs. 66%), and hence the portfolio is more resilient towards equity market declines
(but consequently also more sensitive to fixed income declines).
The scenario tool also underscores impact on risk parity leverage as a result of the
relative dynamics between component volatility and correlation. For example, the first
and third quadrants (upper right and lower left sections) are dominated by scenarios of
greater than 50% deleveraging. On the other hand, the second and fourth quadrants
Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016 5
have episodes of more benign model-driven deleveraging. In each quadrant exists
examples of simultaneously increasing equity and bond volatility (that is, high absolute
equity and bond daily returns). However, in the first and third quadrant, equity and bond
moves are in the same direction, which would likely be an example of increasing
correlation. On the other hand, in the second and fourth quadrant equity and bond
moves are in opposite directions and hence correlation is subject to a decrease. The
main takeaway here is the most risk of model driven deleveraging from vol controlled
risk parity funds comes when both volatility and correlation of the underlying
components rise together.

Week in review & notable trends (US)
US equities at new all-time highs on upbeat employment report
Both the S&P500 and NASDAQ finished the week higher marking fresh all-time highs as
the July nonfarm payrolls and average hourly earnings came in better-than-expected. As
a result, VIX fell to its lowest levels since Jul-14 and the SPX 1y vs. 1m ATMf implied vol
spread rose to its highest level in almost four years on lower short dated vol.
Across other asset classes, the USD finished with gains against other major currencies,
while Treasury yields rose across the curve, which partly explained the outperformance
(underperformance) in Financials (Utilities) (i.e., +1.7% and -2.7%, respectively).
Most companies (86% as of 5-Aug) in the SPX have reported Q2 results and the blended
(actual + estimated) yoy earnings decline for Q2-2016 now stands at -3.5%, less than
the expected decline of -5.5% as of 30-Jun. Analysts expect CY16 earnings decline of -
0.3% which would mark the first time SPX has reported two consecutive years of
earnings decline since 2008. Earnings growth is now expected to resume in Q4-16.

With SPX rallying on a stronger-than-expected July jobs report,
SPX implied vol took a further leg down, especially in the
shorter end of the vol curve. Indeed, SPX 1m ATMf implied vol
ended the week at 9.1 vol pts, within striking distance of its 2-
year lows.
On the other hand, longer dated ATMf implied vols did not fall
nearly as much causing a material steepening in the vol term
structure. For instance, the 1yr-1m implied vol spread reached
its highest level since 27-Sep-12 (6.4 vol pts).

Since its peak in Jul-15, the Biotech sector (NBI Index) has been
on one of its worst runs in decades, underperforming the broad
market benchmark (SPX) by a whopping ~30% on a total return
basis. However, more recently the sector has regained some
lost ground on solid large-cap earnings reports (i.e., +13.2%
since 1-Jul, 9.3% above the SPX).
While short-dated implied vol has dropped considerably as a
consequence of the recent rally, it still remains supported on a
5-yr basis. Also, upside vol has been richening vs. ATM vol, with
the 1m IBB ATM-110 implied vol spread reaching its lowest
level in five years on 4-Aug and finishing the week at 1.2 vol pts
(3 rd 5-yr %-ile).
Investors with a constructive view on the sector who are
concerned about a reversal of the recent gains should consider
replacing or initiating long position via short dated ATM calls
partially financed by expensive OTM calls.

adjustment = we adjust the VIX futures curve to reflect the Trade-Day/252 day-count convention and
use SQRT ((30/365*252/T)) as the adjustment factor to convert to the common day-count
convention used in variance swaps. Term-structure adjustment = we add the median level of the daycount
adjusted generic 1m/2m/3m fly (i.e. -0.5x Sep fut. +1xOct fut. -0.5x Nov fut.) to take into
account the usual VIX term structure.
Using the VIX term structure in the Sep/Oct/Nov buckets and
adjusting for term structure/day convention (see footnote to
Chart 13), we estimate the option markets’ implied move over a
single day in the Oct-Nov period (which encompasses the US
election on 8-Nov).
Our estimated implied move is 1.4% which is notably very close
to the typical 1-day post-election day SPX realized move over
past election cycles (1.5% since 1928) (see Chart 14).
Importantly, there is a larger-than-typical variation in the
distribution of all daily post-election SPX returns (34.0 vol pts
vs. 18.4 vol pts for daily SPX returns since Jan-1928), with the
largest and the fourth largest daily post-election SPX returns
since 1928 occurring in the last two election cycles alone (see
Chart 14).

However, as we have recently argued the debate about whether
a Trump win would be good or bad for markets coupled with the
inability to exactly pinpoint real risks are likely headwinds to a
sizeable market shock.

Volatility in Europe
Buy the seasonal oil dip via bullish X-market risk reversals
Levered X-market risk reversal: Sell 1x USO 3M 25d (~88% strike) puts
to fully fund 2.1x SXEP (Oil & Gas equity) 25d (~106% strike) calls (indic.)
Alternative (unlevered) implementation: Sell USO 25d puts to fund fully
fund closer to the money SXEP calls
The seasonal sell-off in oil presents a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity according to our
commodity strategists, who expect prices to rebound to $55/bbl by year end. In fact
current levels of ~$40 are close to the summer floor ($39) they had previously
suggested.
BofAML strategists have turned bullish Oil & Gas equities given more CB (BoE)
easing, attractive div yields and exposure to the EM recovery narrative. Moreover, Oil &
Gas has been the worst performing Stoxx 600 sector over the last 1M, suggesting it has
ample scope to rally if it is to catch up to the broader equity market (Chart 15).
USO (Oil ETF) puts are rich vs. SXEP (European Oil & Gas equity) calls: The number
of long SXEP 25d calls that can be fully funded by selling 1 short USO 25d put is near
historical highs (90 th percentile since ’08, Chart 16). In contrast, both SXEP and USO risk
reversals are only modestly more attractive than their historical medians.
SXEP calls would have offered better value than USO calls at current levels in terms
of average historical payoffs as well as the frequency of positive returns (when sized for
the same upfront cost, Chart 17). Note that an unlevered implementation of the trade
allows for early participation in any potential SXEP rally (as the SXEP call strike is near
the money) while providing a ~12% buffer before incurring losses (at expiry) on the
short USO leg (Chart 18).
CSPP has purchased an outsized proportion of Energy corporate bonds and this has
yet to feed through to equities according to our credit strategists (Chart 19): The
number of Energy corporate bonds bought by the ECB is approx. 45% of the total
eligible amount – the 3 rd highest proportion across all European sectors.
Potential USO losses may be dampened if the recent $/Oil correlation persists:
Since mid-2015 oil drawdowns have largely coincided with USD weakening (Chart 20).

Week in review (Europe)
The FTSE100 reached 13 months highs last week as the BOE exceeded market
expectations by announcing a 25 bp rate cut (its first rate cut in 7yrs), a further £60bn
of QE purchases (vs forecasted £50 bn) while also hinting at more potential stimulus in
the autumn. Unsurprisingly, GBPUSD fell further on the back of this. The better-thanexpected
US nonfarm payrolls that beat all surveyed forecasts helped drive US markets
to new all-time closing highs also helped European equities rebound from a mid-week
trough. As a result, the V2X has retraced close to its 11 month lows as foreseeable
catalysts are behind us for a potentially quieter end to the summer.
• Long dated ESTX50 var term structure is historically elevated; vol term
structure is not: The dislocation of 3y var convexity (var strike/ATMf volatility)
vs that of 1y, which in itself is near extremes, is particularly striking
• European issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products picked up in July:
We estimate issuance of ~€120Mn/day in July, which compares to €5Mn daily
issuance in June and €55Mn daily issuance in 1H16 (excluding June).
• The current vega outstanding in SX5E-linked products is €143Mn, which is in
its 97 th percentile since Jan-14 (when our records begin). Moreover, this could
rise to as much as €169Mn if the SX5E rallied to 3280.
Long-dated ESTX50 var term structure is steep; vol term structure is not
Despite a significantly steep longer dated ESTX50 variance term structure (vs its
average since 2008), the volatility term structure is nearly flat. As a result, the level of
ESTX50 long dated variance is historically elevated vs the level of long dated vol. The
dislocation of 3y var convexity (varswap strike/ATMf vol ratio) vs 1y var convexity (which
in itself is near its historic highs) is particularly striking.

Structured product Jul update: EU issuance picked up; Korean issuance lagged
We estimate issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products in Europe was
~€120Mn/day in July, much higher than the €5Mn daily issuance in June and €55Mn daily
issuance in 1H16 (excluding June). This compares to ~€20Mn daily issuance in July out of

Own NKY calendar call going into the uncertainty Sep BOJ
Trade update: Closing the NKY Aug/Sep put calendar trade opened on 25-Jul
The short NKY Aug16 15500 put vs. long NKY Sep16 15500-14500 put spread trade
was opened on 25-Jul at 0.24% premium and was closed at 0.28% premium on 8-Aug as
we are approaching the Aug16 expiry. In addition, the Sep-16 NKY put spread has
already carried well by selling the inflated BOJ risk premium even with the spot being
largely unchanged.
NKY & USDJPY 1Mth vols are down to YTD low: Pricing in a slow summer
With the Japanese government announcing a ¥28.1tn fiscal stimulus package last week,
the Abe administration has laid out both its new monetary and fiscal policies. In the
short-term, there are few catalysts and both NKY and USDJPY 1Mth implied volatilities
have retraced materially. VNKY is at 21.5 and USDJPY 1M ATM vol is at 9.8%, near their
YTD low levels.
USDJPY 2M-1M term structure at its steepest & NKY’s in its 98 th %-ile since ‘11
FX has been the main driver in the current Macro world. Chart 29 shows that the
USDJPY 2-month minus 1-month term structure is at its highs since 2011. The Sep BOJ
meeting is expected to be held on 21-Sep so USDJPY 1-month options do not cover the
event. Notably, the NKY term structure is also very steep at 1.5%, which is in its 98 th
percentile since 2011. The NKY term structure was at its steep at 2.5% in Dec-13.

BofAML: BoJ plans for Sep16 'comprehensive assessment' create uncertainty
The BOJ’s decision in keeping “QE” or interest rate unchanged in July highlighted the
BOJ’s limits in expanding JGB purchases and digging deeper into negative interest rate
territory. More importantly, the central bank announced it will conduct a comprehensive
assessment of its policy at its Sep meeting. By giving guidance for the next meeting,
the BoJ has inevitably focused market attention on possible changes to the monetary
policy framework. Significant monetary easing, including helicopter money, cannot be
ruled out, but the more likely scenario is that the BoJ makes current monetary policy,
which is fixed on achieving 2% inflation target in a short period of time, more 'flexible'.
Market expectation for the Sep BOJ in terms of fwd vol is the near its lows YTD
With NKY Sep ATM vol at 17.8% and Oct ATM at 20%, the NKY Sep-Oct ATM forward
vol is at 21.8%, which is at the low end of the trading range going into BOJ events this
year (Chart 30). We think there is value in owning forward vol via calendar options.
Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016 15
A further squeeze in US and Japanese yields is most positive Japan in Asia
The strong US NFP print and the large Japan fiscal plan catalysed a global selloff in
bonds. Chart 31 shows that NKY is the most sensitive Asian market to rising USD & JPY
yield since 2010 with a correlation of 31%.
Buy 1x NKY Oct 17500 call, short 0.65x Sep 17250 call: Gamma neutral, long vol
Given the low market expectation in the BOJ and a potential rally in Japanese equities on
the back of further yield squeeze and rising BOJ expectation next month, we like owning
1x NKY Oct 17500 call vs. selling 0.65x of Sep 17250 call for 0.7% (¥116). The trade will
have a positive 9% delta, 8bps of vega and flat gamma & theta initially.
Indicative pricing (As of 8-Aug-16, Ref: 16650)
Buy 1x NKY Oct 17500 call: 1.13% (¥187) (iv: 19.2, delta: 24%, gamma: 3.8%)
Sell 0.65x NKY Sep 17250 call: 0.66% (¥110) (iv: 16.9, delta: 23%, gamma: 5.9%)
Net: 0.70% (¥116) (delta: +9, vega: 0.08%)

16 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016
Week in review & notable trends (Asia)
The MSCI Asia-Pac USD Index inched down 48bps in an eventful week in terms of macro
news, with equities gains offset by USD strength. Following the monetary policy
changes announced during the BoJ, the Abe Cabinet approved a fiscal stimulus package
totalling ¥28.1tn last week. However, the Nikkei fell 190bps and the yen advanced
another 32bps over the week. The Korean government submitted a KRW28tn fiscal
package proposal to the Congress, which our economists believe should sustain growth
near term; the KOSPI2 was little changed (adding 35bps). The RBA cut rates by 25bps
as our economists expected, but Australian stocks declined with the ASX 200 dropping
117bps. Elsewhere in Asia, the HSI, HSCEI, TWSE and Nifty rallied 1.2%, 1.9% 1.2% and
0.5%, respectively.
Japanese equity implied volatility dropped to YTD lows
• Last week, most major Asian implied vols edged down as underlying indices rallied;
ASX 200 vol increased slightly despite the rate cut
• NKY vol saw a larger decline, with 3M ATM vol dropping 1.1 vol pts to 21.7% mainly
due to diminished uncertainty as the fiscal package rolled out
• Most Asian skews flattened and term structures steepened, especially the Nikkei
term structure (spread between 1yr and 1M ATM vols), which increased 3.0 vol pts
and turned positive
NKY Uridashi issuance continues to fall as existing ones haven’t knocked-out
Despite the falling NKY and relatively high implied volatility, Japanese Uridashi issuance
has further retraced as most existing products have not knocked-out. In Jul-16, there
was $450mn Uridashi products issued which are NKY linked. We estimate that the peak
of vega profile is around the current spot.

Korean structured product issuance increased to US$1.9bn
in July; KOSPI2-linked products dominated
Korean auto-callable product issuance ticked up last month,
with a total of US$ 1.9bn notional issued, vs. US$ 1.6bn total
issuance in June.
Looking at individual underlyings, KOSPI2-linked products
(currently US$578mn) saw the largest increase. KOSPI2-linked
issuance hence took over SX5E-linked issuance (currently
US$436mn), which was relatively unchanged compared to June.
HSCEI-linked issuance (currently US$ 69mn) further declined
whereas HSI-linked issuance (currently US$ 262mn) increased
again. SPX-linked issuance grew to US$ 281mn.

Options Risk Statement
Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk
Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.
Investor suitability
The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options" (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks
involved with investing in listed options:

Disclosures
Important Disclosures
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.
