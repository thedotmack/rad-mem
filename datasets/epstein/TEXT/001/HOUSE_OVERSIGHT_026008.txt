I agree 
Maybe then just stick to Sept 18th meeting - polite and courteous - 
I will be respectful and deferential. 
On the advice of Leonard I'm removing all criticism of scientists from the book 
A production company in LA - connected to my son - is doing a documentary film on the new book. 
They are looking for critics 
I will film part of it as a lecture Al Gore * Inconvenient Truth" style in Nantucket. 
I sent you the poster. 
Can send it again by text 
They would welcome his criticism 
I think we should wait to discuss until Sept 18th unless you suggest we invite him on Sept 23 to Nantucket ? 
I'm thinking what I should do with the Autumn of my life. 
Will get clarity during silence . 
The energy of pleasure has exhausted itself in me as also the energy that goes into " being right" 
I'm ready to serve In a meaningful way 
Love

I just landed in NY 
I'm staring a new phase in my life visa vis my relationship with my critics 
2 scientific papers on my work will be out soon 
Leonard read the new book and made some corrections so now 3 physicists have made sure that the science is 
accurate 
If you haven't sent the book to him please hold off so he gets a corrected copy. 
I'm going to get off my high horse ( the tiger I can't ) and try and start a dialogue with anyone who is willing. 
I will do as you guide me
