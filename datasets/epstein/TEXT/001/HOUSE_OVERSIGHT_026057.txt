Importance: High 
On point! First serious, independent confirmation of Giulio Tononi's theory. This constitutes the primary part of 
our Episode 6 (working outline). Giulio is a Closer To Truth contributor (primarily his theory of consciousness) 
and a friend; he has invited me/CTT to spend 1-2 days in his lab (Madison).
