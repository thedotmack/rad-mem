Hi Jeff 
About time for our actions to turn into theatre and movie pieces. 
Shall we talk? Any news from BC/AdR?

No real communication. Cannot open the NYT article. But to judge from the article's title they are at least 
exaggerating if not totally wrong. This attack will not change strategy in a major way on either side. It will 
however raise respect for DJT in Moscow and few other capitals. That's not necessarily bad, if the WH won't 
read this change as a precedent which calls to be repeated too often.
