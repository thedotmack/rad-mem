Importance: High 
On our to-do list, but back of the envelope, we satisfied ourselves that after depreciation, we would show a profit. (In 
part because Apollo charter payments factor in depreciation.)

Adding Internet and possibly changing cushions. I recommended we do it with the 4 year inspection in the spring, but 
haven't heard back from him. I think I talked him out of automating the divans. I agreed with what you said about

GV is in inspection and going well. Not sure what renovations you mean? 
On depreciation, we think we cannot use accelerated due to foreign travel preponderance, and obviously can't use
