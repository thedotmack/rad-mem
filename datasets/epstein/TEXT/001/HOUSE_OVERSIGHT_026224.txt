It won't take long to do. We're just swamped. I'll get something to you when I can. 
My biggest fear about taking this job is that there wouldn't be enough to do. You told me that concern was crazy. You 
were right.

On our to-do list, but back of the envelope, we satisfied ourselves that after depreciation, we would show a profit. (In

Adding Internet and possibly changing cushions. I recommended we do it with the 4 year inspection in the spring, but
