Steve Bannon trying to get on disgraced 
Jeffrey Epstein's good side 
By Emily Smith 
Steve Bannon shared a secret meeting with reviled billionaire pedophile Jeffrey -Epstein at the 
financier's notorious Upper East Side mansion. 
Former White House chief strategist Bannon was spotted stepping out of his SUV and entering 
the registered sex offender's sprawling 21,000-square-foot mansion at 9 E. 71st St. shortly 
before 7 a.m. Wednesday. 
Epstein's -palatial pad is one of his homes where young_girls were allegedly brought in to 
perform massages and used as "sex slaves." 
We assume Bannon wasn't there for a massage. 
Sources speculate that the disgraced -Epstein wants to use his millions to work his way close to 
political power again. 
One told us, "Bannon needs money to bankroll his political agenda. Epstein has plenty of 
money, and craves power and access." 
Bannon made an early-morning beeline to Epstein, even though Bannon may have burned 
bridges when he savaged Ivanka Trump over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom Bannon 
backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an allegation in -legal

papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald Trump and Epstein had 
raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka, "What about the allegations 
about her dad and that 13-year-old?" 
Epstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world's most powerful___but has 
mostly given money to Democrats. 
From 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, dubbed "The Lolita Express," 
26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at Trump's Mar-a-Lago. 
Trump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. 
It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the 
younger side." 
Epstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13 months 
in jail. 
Last year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens. 
Bannon's rep didn't comment. A lawyer for Epstein said, "Let me ask him," but didn't respond 
by deadline.
