Hi Jeffrey, 
Sorry for the phone tag. In case it's easier to respond by email, I have put my questions below. I'm at my desk and should be 
here until 5, and should be free on my cell phone after 6:30. 
Best, 
Alex

hand? Is the dining room windowless?

-did you tell Michael about a dinner you'd hosted for six tech entrepreneurs who had a combined worth of several hundred 
billion dollars? When was this meal? 
-Do you believe that there are now more people who possess Roosevelt or Carnegie-levels of wealth, the sort that can rival 
governments in influence? That these people face unusual challenges when entering philanthropy due to the sheer size of 
their fortunes? That the rich may know the business that made them rich, but not money itself? 
-are you interested in what will happen to the $4.2 trillion possessed by the super-rich in 40-odd years once they have mostly 
died?

their own marriages and as they raise families? Have any of these employees been romantically involved with you? When 
Michael came to your home, had one of these women recently gone on an around the world honeymoon, which you 
arranged? Do they often travel with you to your other homes — in New Mexico, Paris, Palm Beach, and in the Caribbean? Do 
you maintain there is no quid-pro-quo in the relationships with these women? Do these women often socialize with the policy 
makers and businessmen with whom you often meet? 
-Is your current girlfriend a dental student you met four years ago at a dinner party in New York? 
-Did you date Eva Andersson Dubin? Have you known her for 30 years? Did you pay for her to go to medical school?
