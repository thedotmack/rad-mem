contributors to the core code. The five core developers are like Linus Torvalds of Linux. They decide what 
changes are made to the core code. One of the five is the lead developer, Wladimir, and one is the Chief 
Scientist, Gavin. 
> Gavin, Wladimir and Cory (an important contributing developer) were being paid out of a non-profit 
organization called the Bitcoin Foundation. A few weeks ago, it "blew up" when one of the board members 
declared the foundation "bankrupt". ( https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-
about-the-bitcoin-foundation/ ) Many organizations scrambled to step into the vacuum created by the 
foundation and "take control" of the developers. We moved quickly talking to all of the various stakeholders 
and the three developers decided to join the Media Lab. This is a big win for us.

the small team of developers responsible for maintaining and improving bitcoin's core software.

>> Gavin Andresen, who bears the title of Chief Scientist for the six-person core development team, 
announced on his blog Wednesday that he and two other core developers, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory 
Fields, had moved to the MIT Media Lab's new Digital Currency Initiative, ending their previous status as

employees of the Bitcoin Foundation. The three other core developers, who draw salaries from different 
employers, will continue in that status.
