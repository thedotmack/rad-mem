More fun (enduring) with Closer To Truth; working new episodes from FQXi conference (e.g., "Physics of the 
Observer", "Physics of Consciousness", "Quantum Cosmology of the Beginning?", Philosophy of 
Cosmology"); progressing on "Sleep & Dreams". 
In LA for 2 weeks, then back to China; NY in January. You there then? 
Love to get your sense of Trump's administration, policies.

Mahler's 5th opens with the same rhythmic motif (but 4th note is the same as the first three, not lower as in 
Beethoven's) - Mahler's 5th is my favorite symphony.

for me it is tied to music. beethovens fifth, is 555-3 . though unbeknownst to most people the first 
note ( you can verify, bu looking at the score ) , is a rest note ( silent ) so 0-555-3
