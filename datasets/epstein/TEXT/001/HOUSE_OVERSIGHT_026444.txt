Weingarten, a high-powered attorney at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington known for his folksy style, is a 
somewhat unlikely choice because he has represented Democratic clients and is close friends with Eric H. 
Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama. Holder and Weingarten met during 
their early years at the Justice Department. 
The four finalists did not respond to requests for comment. A White House official said the administration had
