after DJT actually signs it. I'll point out the location of the other eggs much more creative - overall though, 
the writers were very sophisticated. they closed many many loopholes, and did it elegantly. example closing 
all the 1031 crazy transactions by merely inserting the word" real" in from of the word property very 
clever, or not redoing the paragraph but merely changing the penalty to zero. . or detailing related party 
definitions that had teeth. . they cant be faulted for not getting it right -100 percent :)
