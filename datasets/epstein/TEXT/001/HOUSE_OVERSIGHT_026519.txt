Importance: High 
Hi Jeffrey, 
Attached please find the Sept 2 position. The realized gain 
increased by the $28 k option premium that resulted from the 
barrier level trading in USD JPY. The USD sold off vs the AUD, 
GBP and the NZD today. The USD rallied against the CAD and the 
JPY. 
I have separated y t d p/lfrom Sept p/1 so that the numbers mean 
more. 
Hopefully the AUD will stay above .88 going into next Monday. As 
I write this it is approx .9o, which is good. I know it's not BRL, but 
I think that we are realizing some good gains. In the weeks ahead 
volatility will likely increase as Congress considers standing behind 
Obama and attacking Syria. Liquidity in restricted currencies can 
disappear at the trader's will. I prefer that we trade liquid easily 
currencies at a time like this.
