On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito and we go to that.

Hallo everybody! 
Attached (sorry in Germain) the Programm fort he lifeball on the 19th. 
Actually there will be a Galadinner with our prime minister and Bill Clinton and all kinds of stars in 
the Hofburg (former Imerial estate - very impressive to see from inside)) It is only 250 people,. A 
seated dinner and more upscale than the rest oft he evening. It start's at 5pm with a Champagne cocktail 
and from there we go directly to the opening oft he ball where we'll have a really cool Box first row!! 
Dresscode: actually the lifeball is really crazy and 'half naked' We always do a intermediare because 
otherwise you feel like an idiot at the Amfar Gala dinner before. People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. 
Christoph wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be 
in any crazy stuff on all the pics. Half oft he people oft he gala dinenr also waer some 'little' crazy 
stuff like pink velvet sakkos (and a mask for later) or so. girls: Crazy as you like. There are a lot of 
atrists that are really dressed up. I will wear a quiet see-through short dress with high high heels+ a 
chanel Tatoo and will take a face mask fort he ball later. 
So I hope this helped at least a little bit. For pics got to: lifeball.org 
Friday night: We would like to invite you all for dinner and will organize a nice place with a cool bar. 
Aress follows. Pls let me know who wants to join!! 
Sunday: I'm very sure we'll be dead :-) BUT we would like to invite you to our house/garden/pool 
(swimmwear) for brunch starting at 11. Furfanggasse 4, 1190 Wien. From hotel Sachen max. 15 min with 
Taxi. If you fly late we can walk from our house to one oft he famous Austrian heurigen ...and get some 
more alcholic to drink :-) :-) 
On Thursday there is a big Premiere of Mozart La Clemenza de Tito. Very hard to get tickets but for 2 of 
you I could still organize (hopefully9 if some of you already arrive on Thursday. 
Big kiss to everbody...I promise you...not often you will have seen something that crazy :-)
