Perfect, my father is in Florence now ; we all fly on Sunday to Tanzania for 6 days with my 
daughters. 
I believe that the American Ambassador will go back to the US in a few months after the 
elections , even if President Obama wins. Maybe you want to ask him about the letter for the 
Interallie before his departure?
