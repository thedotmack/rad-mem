Global Asset Allocation
09 November 2012
The J.P. Morgan View
Do US elections change anything?
� Asset allocation –– The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario,
but from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks are
unchanged. These keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite
the likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay
underweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have
moved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe.
� Economics –– The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the
bottom in global activity growth, and that we are gently lifting from those
levels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend.
� Fixed Income –– Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread
compression trades.
� Equities –– We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders.
� Credit –– We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk.
� Currencies –– Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations.
� Commodities –– A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long
base metals.
� Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly, with US stocks
down some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond
markets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this
turmoil. We don’t think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook,
or risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in
market pricing.
� By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US
elections confirm the status quo in Washington, and to us, they do so also for
the broad economic and market outlook, from current levels. Hence, we do not
see much reason to change our investment allocations, and remain medium-term
overweight both credit and equities against cash, government debt, and
commodities. We do so on the basis of value – still high risk premia – fading
risks on fiscal policy in the US into next year; an expected rebound in global
growth; and super easy monetary policy, with more QE coming if growth were
to disappoint.
� In recent weeks, we have switched out of our long-standing US risk overweight,
into an underweight, on the argument that the US had the most committed
central banker, its growth has been least disappointing, and its fiscal risks were
further into the future. This relative risk has changed, with Chinese economic
data confirming that its economy is rebounding, while the ECB now creating a
period a relative financial “peace”. The US, in contrast, is at the start of intense
negotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither
side of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will
still be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side’s
position.

As a result, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our
US credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against
Europe and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q1 growth in the Euro area
and better activity data in China made us move the lion’s share of the
overweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday’s Global Market
Outlook and Strategy).
Chinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for
IP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This
creates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a
gentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% early this year to just
above 8% in Q1. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary
stimulus. The 18th Party Congress started yesterday, will last a week, and will
be followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for
the economic outlook will be the Annual Central Economic Working
Conference that will be held in December. We expect it to support continued
moderate fiscal policy, a neutral monetary policy, and further economic
rebalancing towards domestic consumption. It may also lower the 2013
growth target to 7%. For more details, see Haibin Zhu in today’s GDW.
Fixed Income
�

Bonds rallied strongly, in the slipstream of the tumbling equity market.
President Obama’s re-election perhaps also diminishes expectations of a
change in course at the Fed.
The ECB and the Bank of England stood pat at their policy meetings this
week, but the latter delivered a curveball today, announcing that its net
coupon income from QE would be transferred to the UK Treasury from next
year on. The near-term effect is a slight monetary easing, as the money will
be used to reduce the amount of gilts in issue, similar to QE itself.
Beyond that, this is another small step towards perceptions that monetary
policy is no longer independent from fiscal policy, like the Bank of Japan’s
joint statement with two government ministers last month. Nobody knows the
tipping point at which these perceptions feed into much higher inflation
expectations, just that we’ll know it when we see it.
Core euro bond yields are towards the low end of the range, and we expect
them to head higher. But we focus more risk on spread compression trades,
via overweights in Euro area peripherals, US MBS, and EM local bonds vs
DM.
Equities
�
�
�
Equity markets fell sharply post US elections, but we are not changing our
strategy.
From a month ago, we avoided directional longs in our GMOS model equity
portfolio due to elevated positions by spec investors (see Charts A10 and A12
in today’s Flows & Liquidity). We preferred to focus instead on regional and
sectoral trades. We stay with the same strategy focusing our
recommendations on EM Asia across regions, and Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders across sectors.
The rebound in the October global manufacturing PMI is what keeps us long
Cyclical vs. Defensive equity sectors. Is this a high-beta trade? Not

necessarily. Last summer, as equity markets rebounded in June and July,
Cyclical sectors actually underperformed. The thin grey line in the top chart
shows that Cyclical sectors have recaptured only a quarter of the
underperformance seen between March and August and thus provide a better
entry point. Position indicators suggest that investors are underweight
Cyclicals and overweight Defensives which is turn means that Defensive
sectors are more vulnerable to position unwinding.
�
We introduced an underweight in US equities in mid October to position for
the US fiscal cliff risk. Obama’s win makes it more likely that this risk will
intensify into year-end. Across regions we favor EM Asia and Europe vs. the
US. While the US is facing fiscal cliff risks, Asian equities are benefiting
from concrete signs that economic activity is rebounding in China. European
equities are benefiting from greater improvement in financial conditions,
although they are more vulnerable to noise around the Greek and Spanish
issues.
Credit
�
�
�
US credit spreads edged wider in response to the fall in equity markets
following the US elections. US HG widened 7bp to 160bp, undoing around
half of October’s peak-to-trough moves. Similar moves registered in other
USD credit markets. At 107bp, the CDX.IG is now back to early-August
levels, even as the CDS-Bond basis moved back into negative territory with
corporate bond spreads again moving above CDS.
Credit spreads may be repricing the risk of a fiscal-cliff induced recession in
2013. For context, we expect the eventual outcome of the negotiations to lead
to about 2% of GDP in fiscal contraction, not enough to tip the economy back
into recession in itself, and considerably lower than the 4% drag under the full
enactment of all revenue raising measures and spending cuts currently set to
become law on Jan 1.
From our point of view, the elections confirm the status quo both in
Washington and in market conditions – i.e. we should expect more of the
same and it has been a great year for credit. Therefore, we see the current
dip as an opportunity to add risk, and expect spreads to continue to tighten
into year end, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months. We stay down in
quality and outline in GMOS this week some relative value arguments for
Euro HY vs US HY. On that front, European credit shrugged off the election
outcome, tightening marginally in the HG space and widening very slightly in
the HY space.
Foreign Exchange

The post-US election drama is unfolding as expected. Four more years with
the same cast is delivering a higher USD versus most currencies but JPY due
to deleveraging ahead of the fiscal cliff, and lower USD/CNY forwards due to
avoidance of US-China trade conflict (see An FX guide to America’s toss-up
election, FX Markets Weekly, Nov 2). The only surprise has been that FX
volatility remains so subdued (VXY unchanged at 7.4%) in a week when the
trade-weighted dollar and equity volatility have rallied. Chalk it up to
positioning, as most indicators suggest that institutions investors entered the
US polls with aggregate USD positions close to flat.
Now, sausage-making season begins. US recession is guaranteed if the fiscal
cliff is enacted on schedule, and neither Congress nor the President welcomes

that outcome. But avoiding the worst case requires a short-term bargain plus a
long-term compromise on a scale not seen in Washington since the Clinton-
Congressional budget showdown of 1995/96. As with sausage making, this
process won’t be pleasant to watch. It would be easier to return in several
weeks when the final product is ready, but for those who cannot avoid, ignore
the likely volatility, and add to defensive trades.
Washington needs at least a month to broker deferral of a decent part of the
fiscal cliff before it can assume the monumental task of comprehensive fiscal
reform next year, and the currencies most vulnerable to an impasse are
expensive. If no grand bargain is reached before the end of the year, full
implementation of the cliff implies enough fiscal tightening to drive the dollar
up 3%-5% versus commodity currencies, given typical patterns during global
growth shocks. Even if these tax increases are reversed later in the year, the
first response would be a higher USD versus all currencies but the yen, given
how long that investors are of cyclical currencies and how short they are the
yen.
Stay short USD/JPY and buy USD vs high-beta (AUD, NZD, SEK and GBP)
in cash and options for a move of a few percent in coming weeks. In options,
sell a 1-mo NZD/USD call (0.8250 strike, 0.83 RKI), buy a bearish 2-mo
AUD/USD seagull (buy 1.03-1.01 put spread, sell 1.05 call) and buy a bearish
2-mo GBP/USD seagull (buy 1.57-1.55 put spread, sell 1.6250 call). Buy
USD/SEK in cash.
Commodities
�
�
�
Commodities are up some 1% this week, led by precious metals, which
rallied almost 4%. The strong gains in gold are probably due to the US
election result as Obama’s victory means no change to Fed policy and so
continued QE and negative real yields. Gold also tends to gain when there is
high fiscal uncertainty, just as it did last year during the acrimonious debt
ceiling debate which cost the US its AAA rating. We stay long gold.
Chinese economic data came out stronger than expected this week, providing
support for our view that Chinese economic growth has bottomed and will
rebound through next year. China’s slowing activity growth has been a major
drag on commodities over the last few years and the improving economy is
what makes us long base metals.
The expected rebound in Chinese growth does not imply that we will go back
to the double-digit growth rates that we saw before the crisis, and immediately
after. The periods when China’s economy grew at a pace above 8% coincided
with very strong price gains on commodities, as it boosted global demand.
China’s leadership is in the process of reorienting its economy towards
domestic consumption and to reduce reliance on exports and capital
investments. As a result, Chinese growth will likely settle in a 7%-8% range
over the medium term, a growth pace that in the past has not put upwards
pressure on commodity prices.
