Dear Mr Epstein, 
> 
Further to emails ofJanuary 21, I crossed an image of a rare 17th Century Marble Bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius 
you purchased from me during the second half of the 90's. 
I recalled upon many occasions you visiting Bennison, Pimlico Road and being extremely respectful and courteous, 
as Miss Maxwell was on each occasion. 
From recent media reports about you and our Prince Andrew, I do not believe you, Miss Maxwell and Prince Andrew 
would undermine your conduct the way reports are suggesting. 
I feel for you all and hope this episode clears so you can concentrate on your professional activities that do positive 
things for our countries. 
You may have heard a report an interesting report conducted by a genius Lawyer Michael Shrimpton - Michael 
Shrimpton youtube - Exposes Ted Heath (and others) 
The report is shocking and is not a hair-line what you are wrongly accused of (based upon our many meetings). 
Further David Dicke reports on the USA former President George W. Bush Senior which again is shocking, 
unbelievable, unacceptable... 
Mr Michael Shrimpton & Mr David Dicke are worth watching if you haven't yet crossed their researching of public 
figures that have (literally by reports) got away with murder. 
Please find attached an image of Vitellius, pair of 19th Century Medici Lions (that are perfect for one of your estates), 
emperor Vespasian and a pair of Piranesi Engravings for your consideration. 
Do not hesitate to contact me should you require more details. 
Warm regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
Mark Green. 
Cel. 
BEST WISHES TO THE THREE OF YOU!!!

Subject: January 21: A Pair of 19th Century Carved Sicilian Marble Figures of the Medici Style Lions-
Dear Mr Epstein, 
Hope you are well! 
Please find attached images of: 
A POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT PAIR OF 19TH CENTURY FINELY CARVED SICILIAN MARBLE FIGURES OF LIONS 
IN THE MANNER OF THE MEDICI LIONS 
DIMENSIONS: HEIGHT 77" - 196 CMS (INCLUDING PLINTH BASES) x LENGTH 39" - 99 CMS x WIDTH 16" - 41 CMS 
£160,000= RETAIL 
£120,000= TRADE Plus 5% Commission 
THE LIONS REPRESENT 'GRAND TOUR SOUVENIR' WORKS OF ART AND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO 
DECORATE THE GROUNDS OF AN HISTORICAL HOUSE 
The original figures were commissioned by 'Ferdinando I de'Medici' and were excuted by Giovanni di Scherano 
Fancelli in c.1598, and accompanied by a mirror-image version by contemporary sculptor Flaminio Vacca (1538-
1605). 
The original pair remained in Rome until 1789, before being moved to Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, where they can 
still be seen today. The two sculptures were hugely influential in eighteenth-century Europe: copies and versions can 
be found from landscape gardens to mantlepieces 
The figures are museum quality. 
The lots are currently located in Barnwell Manor, Barnwell, near Oundle, Peterborough, PE8 5PJ. 
They are the finest examples of 19th Century 'Grand Tour Souvenir' works of art of 16th Century sculpture outside of 
a museum. 
Should you require more details please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Yours sincerely, 
Mark Green. 
Cel.
