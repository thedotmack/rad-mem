Do You Know This Guy? 
He is Edward "Ed" Mezvinsky, born January 17, 1937. And so who is 
Ed Mezvinsky? 
Well, he is a former Democrat congressman who represented Iowa's 
1st congressional district in the United States House of 
Representatives for two terms, from 1973 to 1977. 
He sat on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of 
Richard Nixon. 
He was outspoken saying that Nixon was a crook and a disgrace to 
politics and the nation and should be impeached. 
He and the Clintons were friends and very politically intertwined for 
many years. 
Ed Mezvinsky had an affair with NBC News reporter Marjorie Sue 
Margolies and later married her after his wife divorced him. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026613 
In 1993, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat in 
Congress, cast the deciding vote that got President Bill Clinton's 
controversial tax package through the House of Representatives. 
In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 
of 69 counts of federal criminal bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. 
Ed Mezvinsky embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people 
via both a Ponzi scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams. 
He was found guilty and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison. 
After serving less than five years in federal prison, he was released in 
April 2008 and remains on federal probation. 
To this day, he still owes $9.4 million in restitution to his many 
victims. 
About now you are saying, "So what!" 
Well, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky. 
That's right; Ed Mezvinsky is Chelsea Clinton's father-in law. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026614 
Now Marc and Chelsea are in their early thirties and purchased a $10.5 
million NYC apartment. 
Has anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media? 
If this guy was Jenna or Barbara Bush's, or better yet, Sarah Palin's 
daughter's father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and 
every detail would be reported over and over and over. 
And yet liberals say there are no double standards in political 
reporting. 
And people are already talking about Hillary as our next 
President! 
And then there is possibly Chelsea for president in our 
future! 
The cycle never ends! 
Lying and corruption seem to make Democrat 
candidates more popular.
