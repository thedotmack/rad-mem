Subject: Tax Planning Under Trump 
Importance: High 
not sure your thoughts on likelihood of his plan (with very little details) passing 
my concern and thoughts are that if itemized deductions are capped at 200,000 you will be impacted by Trump 
plan 
your itemized deductions on the last 2 years returns were as follows: 
2015 1,721,474 
2014 739,139 
the two biggest items on your itemized are RE Taxes of approximately 600,000 per year and investment interest 
expense from STC K-1 with the majority coming from boothbay 
i thought that 2016 may be a good year to contribute appreciated stock to gratitude or enhanced for three 
reasons: 
a) potential cap on itemized per trump 
b) very low EDC income this year so your effective tax rate is higher 
c) if itemized stays however tax rates go down charitable deduction is worth more in 2016 
Gratitude & Enhanced Summary 
Cash 4,738,854 
Equities 3,792,177 
Fixed Income 2,199,792  
Total Value as of 10-31-2016 10,730,823 
Although calculation below does not factor in growth i ran summaries how long foundations can continue to 
make annual contributions at the following levels: 
600,000 17.88 years 
700,000 15.33 years 
800,000 13.41 years 
900,000 11.92 years 
1,000,000 10.73 years
