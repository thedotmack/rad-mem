'Shady' Israeli Mogul Hires Ex-White House Counsel To Represent Employee Arrested in Inauguration Day 
Riot, Raising Questions<http://heatst.com/politics/shady-israeli-mogul-hires-ex-white-house-counsel-to-
represent-employee-arrested-in-inauguration-day-riot-raising-questions/> 
By Heat Street Staffl 6:36 pm, January 23, 2017 
The mystery surrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and security firms working for 
repressive regimes — is growing. 
The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked again this weekend when Kathryn Ruemmler, who 
until recently was President Obama's White House Counsel, showed up on Saturday morning in local 
Washington DC court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting on Inauguration Day. 
[http://heatst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obamajpg?w=300]Kathryn Ruemmler and client. 
Ms. Ruemmler said she was there to represent a journalist, on assignment for the media company 
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.com/>, who'd gotten swept up with the protesters in the arrests. 
Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a big gun like Ruemmler, who has long 
been a specialist in corporate crime, would show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a 
journalist doing his job. 
Ms. Ruemmler told Buzzfeed that Vocativ is a client of her 
firm,<http s ://www.buzz feed. co m/zo etillman/pro s ecutors-pursue-rioting- charges- over-inauguration- day-
pro?utm term=.gtPej4zonti.cgyzaBvG2> Latham & Watkins. The firm is one of the most prestigious law shops 
in New York and Washington with partners such as Ruemmler<https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler> 
charging thousands of dollars an hour. 
She did look somewhat out of place among the lawyers there to defend anarchists and other alleged 
troublemakers who are charged with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the capital. 
"The individuals charged were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a 
cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers," according to Buzzfeed. That was not the case 
when it came to Vocativ. 
Based in New York and Tel Aviv, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health studies, aggregated videos for 
Facebook, and female focused feature pieces. The company which employs a large team of US journalists and 
ex-Israeli intelligence operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to source its stories. 
Indeed its founder, Kochavi, has a background in Israeli intelligence, having made his fortune providing 
security and military grade public safety solutions to the superrich Emirate of Abu Dhabi through an entity 
called AGT. 
[http ://heatst. com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/abu-dhabi-mosque.jp g?w=300] The Grand Mosque of Abu 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026653 
Dhabi 
AGT was responsible for installing a "unique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means 'every person 
is monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment they return to it,' according to the noted 
security publication MiddleEastEye.<http ://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surveillance-2104952769> 
The invasive system is dubbed "Falcon Eye". 
Kochavi also owns Israeli security and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ, 
3iMind claims to use "the deep web" to mine information, though in 3iMind's case it provides spy services, not 
journalistic ones. 3iMind even advertises online that it will spy on "the planning and execution of violent civil 
unrest" for clients.<https://www.3i-mind.com/use cases/political-social-unrest/> 
The website for Kochavi's mother company<https://www.agtinternational.com/about/>, AGT, claims its current 
business is using "Internet of Things" technology for entertainment and "fashion" applications in partnership 
with the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though it's unclear what any of these applications really 
are<http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/berlin-2016/news/i/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-
joint-venture-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-makes-first-official-foray-into-sports>, and certainly 
what value they provide for entertainment. Security experts say Internet of Things type sensors could be tied 
together to monitor crowds for security purposes. 
According to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi's companies can blur, with Vocativ 
employees doing work for 3iMind and Logic, and vice versa. So who was this "journalist" arrested amid the 
unrest on Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as some journalists around town have been 
asking, could he also have been doing surveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli 
client, possibly a foreign government?

=300]Kochavi employee Evan Engel (LinkedIn) 
A call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifying himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat 
Street that the arrested employee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was detained. 
"The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for 
Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom," the spokesperson said. "Vocativ will 
vigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge." 
Kochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying and surveillance, on his American activities. 
Vocativ acts like a news organization, though it's made little splash (and gets remarkably little web 
traffic<http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com>) for an operation so large and expensive. 
Kochavi has also shown little hesitation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America to 
provide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall's Wikipedia data dump revealed that he and his 
longtime business partner, New York rainmaking lawyer Mary Edelman, offered Bill Clinton millions of dollars 
to serve as honorary chairman of the company that would become Vocativ. <http://heatst.com/biz/wikileaks-
bill-clinton-turned-down-8-million-to-be-honorary-chairman-of-news-site-vocativ/> Clinton turned them down, 
perhaps nervous about Kochavi who's been described as "a mysterious even somewhat shady character" and the 
Israeli "version of the old-fashioned arms dealer with a suit and an MBA" by the progressive Jewish blog 
Tikkun Olam.<https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2014/12/04/israeli-cyber-security-merchant-peddles-wares-

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026654 
And now Kochavi has purchased the services of President Obama's former White House counsel, Ruemmler, 
whose name was once on the shortlist<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ruemmler-attorney-general-nixed-
20141024-story.html> for US attorney general. It's a fair question to ask: why was Ruemmler really down in 
local DC court on a Saturday morning? Why was getting this Vocativ employee off the hook such a high 
priority? And what, if any, other services has Ruemmler, the corporate crime expert, been providing to Kochavi 
and his various intelligence operations around the world? 
Ruemmler herself has not returned requests for comment.

More than 200 people are being charged with felony rioting — a charge that carries a maximum sentence of 10 
years in jail — after they were arrested during anti-Trump demonstrations on Inauguration Day in DC.

WASHINGTON — As hundreds of thousands of demonstrators 
gathered<https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/womens-
march?utm term=.wra9MGEmBAgtOrQXPW34> on the National Mall to protest President Trump on 
Saturday, people arrested<https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/rioters-and-police-are-clash-during-trumps-
inauguration> the day before during anti-Trump protests in downtown Washington, DC, made their first 
appearance in court. 
Prosecutors are pursuing charges against all of the 230 people arrested on Friday for rioting, according to the 
US attorney's office in DC. Although anti-Trump demonstrations on inauguration day were largely peaceful, 
some turned violent, with participants breaking storefront windows, throwing bricks at police, and running 
through streets and parks downtown as they were chased by police. 
The arraignment hearing at DC Superior Court began on Saturday around 1 p.m. and was still going six hours 
later. As of 7 p.m., 80 people arrested and charged with felony rioting had come before a judge. The court was 
expected to continue the hearing through the night until everyone arrested on Friday came through. 
The defendants processed so far were released until their next court dates, with the condition that they not be 
arrested again in DC in the meantime. 
Felony rioting is a crime under DC law that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to 
$25,000. According to police, six officers were injured in confrontations with demonstrators on Jan. 20, and 
three of those officers sustained minor head injuries after objects were thrown at them. The DC law defines 
felony rioting as a group of at least five people who, "by tumultuous and violent conduct and the threat thereof," 
cause "serious bodily harm" or property damage valued at more than $5,000. 
A 21-year-old Texas man was also charged with pointing a laser at at US Park Police helicopter during the 
protests on Friday. He was arraigned in Superior Court but the case is being moved to federal court. 
The individuals charged with rioting were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were 
represented by a cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers. One exception came early in the 
hearing, when former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler entered an appearance for one of the 
defendants. Ruemmler said her client was a journalist on assignment filming the demonstrations who was swept 
up in the arrests. 
Ruemmler served as President Obama's White House counsel for three years before going to the law firm 
Latham & Watkins. Ruemmler told reporters outside of the courtroom that her firm represents Vocativ, the 
media company that employed her client, which is how she got involved. 
Dozens of people came to the courthouse on Saturday to support the arrestees. They cheered as defendants left 
the courtroom; some of the defendants were walking slowly to keep their shoes on because they had to remove 
their shoelaces after being arrested. The defendants were held by police overnight.

Zoe Tillman / BuzzFeed News 
By Saturday night, a crowd had gathered outside the courthouse to greet the arrestees, cheering and applauding 
as they came out. A line of police formed in between the group and the courthouse entrance, and police were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026656 
screening people trying to go inside. 
Several lawyers offered a preview of their defense strategy during the hearing, arguing that the rioting charge 
should be dismissed because prosecutors hadn't shown that each defendant was specifically involved in the 
rioting described in charging documents. Although the defendants were brought out in groups before the judge, 
they're individually charged. 
One lawyer argued that the US attorney's office should recuse from prosecuting the cases because the 
defendants were charged with participating in anti-Trump riots and Trump was now in charge of the US 
Department of Justice. 
"I appreciate all the creative arguments," Magistrate Judge Rainey Brandt said in response, but she said that at 
this early stage of the case she only had to find that the government had shown probable cause to move the 
cases forward. 
The defendants are due back in court on various dates in February and March.

Officials in the nation's capital are throwing the book at anti-Trump protesters —threatening the people who 
were arrested <http ://nyp o st. com/2017/01/20/dozens-arrested-as-anti-trump-protesters-clash-with-p o lice> with 
massive fines and up to 10 years in jail. 
The U.S. attorney's office will seek to charge all 230 of the protesters who took to the streets on Inauguration 
Day — some damaging storefronts and clashing with police — with felony rioting. 
As of Saturday evening, 80 people had already been slapped with the heavy charges, which include fines of up 
to $25,000 and up to 10 years in jail, according to

Felony rioting is defined in D.C. law by at least five people who use "tumultuous and violent conduct of the 
threat thereof' to cause "serious bodily harm" and instigate more than $5,000 in property damage. 
Six local officers were injured by protesters during Trump's big day. The glass windows of several businesses 
were shattered in downtown D.C. including Bank of America, McDonald's and Starbucks. 
All of the people who have already been charged were released on their own recognizance and given their next 
court appearance dates. 
At least one of those arrested was a Vocativ journalist covering the protests, and he was defended by heavy-
hitter and former White House attorney Kathryn Ruemmler, Buzzfeed reported.
