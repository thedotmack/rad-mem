Here's something simple we all can do today... 
Diana Chapman Walsh was president of Wellesley College 8 years ago. She recently emailed her former colleagues the 
following idea: 
Listen Up! The Republicans need to get the message from the majority of Americans that we value and need the benefits 
of Obamacare. Here's how we do that. 
On January 23rd, everyone who feels that way (our numbers are legion) sends a note to Donald Trump with a simple 
message: 
"Don't make America sick again. Improve Obamacare. Don't repeal it." 
One envelope for every ACA supporter in your household...even if they are under 18 years old. 
Just that simple message. Put it in an envelope, and put a stamp on it. 
On January 23rd, mail it to: 
Pres. Donald Trump 
1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, 
Washington, DC 20500 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026659 
Can you imagine the picture of 53 MILLION letters arriving at the White House by January 26th? It will be a mountain. 
That image might help deter the Republicans from killing the most substantial improvement to American healthcare since 
the discovery of Penicillin. 
Do it today! Drop it into a mailbox near you on Monday, January 23rd. 
Please send this email to 20 (or more) of your friends, neighbors ann fellow Americans. Ask them to do the same. 
This also helps out the US Postal Service, with about $20 Million of stamp sales. 
Don't send emails to Trump...they don't photograph well. 
I attached a document with the text so you can just print it and put it in the envelope
