REGULATORY & COMPLIANCE ALERT 
FEBRUARY 15, 2017 
TIC Form SHC Deadline Approaching - Form Deadline is 
March 3, 2017 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury recently released a revised Form SHC. Form SHC, which is part of 
the Treasury International Capital ("TIC") data reporting system, is the mandatory five-year benchmark 
survey of the ownership of foreign securities by U.S. residents. Absent an announcement of a delay 
from the Trump administration, the report is due to the Federal Reserve Board of NY ("FRBNY") by March 
3, 2017 for data reportable as of December 31, 2016. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026664 
All U.S. resident custodians and end-investors with holdings of foreign portfolio securities above the 
reporting thresholds must report. In addition, all U.S.-resident custodians and end-investors that are 
notified by the FRBNY are required to file a report. 
The reporting threshold for Schedule 2 is $200 million in total fair value of all foreign securities owned 
by the SHC Reporter and not held with a U.S.-resident custodian. The reporting threshold for Schedule 
3 is $200 million in total fair value of foreign securities held with any one unaffiliated U.S.-resident 
custodian that is not a central securities depository. 
Custodians are all organizations that hold securities in safekeeping for other organizations. Most U.S.-
resident custodians also invest in foreign securities for their own account. U.S.-resident custodians 
should report both the foreign portfolio securities held in safekeeping for other U.S. residents and their 
own foreign portfolio securities. 
End-investors are U.S.-resident organizations that invest in foreign securities for their own portfolios or 
invest on behalf of others, such as investment managers/fund sponsors. This includes securities that are 
held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. U.S.-resident end-investors include, but are not 
limited to: 
• Financial and non-financial organizations 
• Managers of private and public pension funds 
• Managers/sponsors of funds, country funds, unit-investment funds, exchange-traded funds, 
collective-investment trusts, hedge funds or any other similarly pooled, commingled funds. Also 
managers/sponsors of private equity companies, venture capital companies, hedge funds and other 
private investment vehicles 
• Insurance companies 
• Foundations 
• Institutions of higher learning 
• Trusts and estates 
• Funds and similar entities that own shares or units of, or other portfolio equity interests in, 
a foreign related or non-related entity 
Form SHC is comprised of three schedules: 
Schedule 1 - Must be filed by all entities thati) receive a copy of the SHC forms and instructions 
from the FRBNY, or 2) are notified by the FRBNY that they are required to file the SHC report. 
Schedule 1 requests information that identifies the reporter. It also provides contact 
information, indicates the reporting status, and summarizes the data, if any, reported on 
Schedule 2 and/or Schedule 3. 
Schedule 2 - Used to report detailed information on foreign securities owned by U.S.-resident 
investors (1) that the reporter safe-keeps for itself or for its U.S.-resident clients or (2) for which 
the reporter directly employs foreign-resident sub-custodians or U.S.-resident or foreign-
resident central securities depositories (CSDs) to manage the safekeeping of those securities 
(Foreign securities in safekeeping with U.S.-resident CSDs are reportable on Schedule 2.) or (3) 
that are instruments of the type that there is no U.S. custodian to manage the safekeeping of 
those securities. 
Schedule 3 - Used to report summary amounts for all foreign securities entrusted to the 
safekeeping of a U.S.-resident custodian, excluding those entrusted to a U.S. - resident CSD.

Completed reports may be submitted to the FRBNY on paper or electronically through the Federal 
Reserve Reporting Central System. Additional information and a copy of the Form SCH are available
