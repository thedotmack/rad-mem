We ended 2016 with a slightly positive quarter, bringing net performance for the year to +3.84%. Consistent
with the trend seen earlier in the year, 2016 has been described by investors and financial media as among
the worst years for multi-manager multi-strategy firms, on both an absolute and risk-adjusted return basis.
While we consider earning +3.84% to be disappointing for our strategy on an absolute return basis, doing so
with a maximum drawdown of 1.4%, and in what was a challenging environment for low-net exposure
relative value strategies, leaves us viewing 2016 as a “good” bad year.
For a second consecutive year, the Fund generated positive net returns overall on the days when the S&P
500 Index was negative. The S&P had 121 losing days in 2016 (producing losses of over -66% in total) 3 and
on those days, we were positive approximately 55% of the time, and generated almost half of our total net
returns for the year. Given that we aim to be a protector of capital in markets that most managers will lose
capital, this sampling is especially gratifying. As we look forward, we remain as encouraged as ever that our
combination of unique “niche” strategies and strategies with structural edge, alongside our allocations to
low-beta alpha-generating stock pickers and quantitative portfolio managers, will deliver strong riskadjusted
returns over various market cycles.
Before going into the performance attribution for Q4 and 2016 overall, we want to re-visit a topic discussed
in our Q1 2016 letter related to hedge fund crowding, which investors have continued to ask us about the
past several months. The question raised is typically some variation of the following: Given that Boothbay
allocates to low-net equity focused managers, who may have similar strategies to those that comprise other
multi-manager platforms, why has Boothbay been less-exposed to deleveraging and hedge fund crowding

effects, which seem to impact other multi-manager funds in a greater way?
Platform Beta
Equity market performance is a large predictor of returns for many long/short equity hedge funds, due to the
large equity beta exposure with which many funds run. 4 At Boothbay, we generally run with limited net
equity market exposure (on average 6-8% historically) and have maintained low correlation to market
indices. While the sources of our returns will generally be idiosyncratic, there is no question that the
tremendous amount of capital that has flown into the low-net multi-manager, i.e. “platform”, category, has
created an even greater risk of exposure to “Platform Beta” for some of our managers, even while avoiding
broader equity market beta.
Platform Beta is a term we have heard used to describe the overlap of long and short positions, across some
of the largest market-neutral, multi-manager hedge fund managers. While these overlapping names may be
viewed as “smart money” positioning in some sense, there is also meaningful risk associated with being in
crowded longs and shorts due to the viciousness of the cascading effects when these portfolios are being
liquidated, or re-sized quickly, as we observed in Q1 2016. For a variety of reasons, we believe that
Platform Beta has a true positive expectancy over time and with much less risk than other traditional factor
risks, especially ones taken on by long-only or long-biased investors. While we consider it to be an obvious
goal to avoid material exposure to all known market risk factors, we also attempt to reduce our more
difficult to measure Platform Beta exposure when possible. Despite the positive return expectation of
Platform Beta, we do not think a large or concentrated exposure to this factor is beneficial. Perhaps even
more importantly, we do not believe that all alpha is created equally, and we are trying to provide the most
uncorrelated alpha as possible to our investors.
So how do we minimize overexposure to Platform Beta? We can monitor data that imperfectly points to
crowded names or themes, but the most direct way we seek to avoid crowded names is through our overall
portfolio construction and manager-selection process. This is demonstrated in our continued focus on “First
Loss” allocations as well as investments in the strategy category we call “Other”, which is comprised of
niche strategies outside our more traditional long/short fundamental and quantitative strategies. These
alternative categories have served as a valuable source of alpha as well as diversification away from
Platform Beta. Additionally, even in our more traditional strategies, we focus on allocating to smaller
managers who can have larger parts of their portfolios in smaller capitalization companies, which tend to be
less trafficked by the larger funds, and therefore are also less subject to the effects of large industry
deleveraging. We cannot avoid all of the dangers of hedge fund deleveraging but our conscious attempts to
target differentiated strategies, and to limit concentration, has allowed us to be less impacted by these flows
than several other multi-manager platforms.
Portfolio Attribution and Risk
Within our Multi-Strategy platform, the “Other” category was the largest contributor for both Q4 and 2016
overall, contributing gross returns of +0.82% in Q4 and +2.19% YTD. The remaining quarterly and full-year
gross return attribution within the Multi-Strategy platform were: “Fundamental L/S” at -0.86% in Q4 and
+1.16% YTD, and “Quantitative” at 0.29% in Q4 and -1.53% YTD. Our First Loss platform allocations
contributed gross-returns of +0.72% in Q4 and +6.60% YTD. 5
The Fund averaged approximately 0.39% daily Value at Risk during Q4 vs. 0.41% in Q3 (95% Confidence
Interval, excluding First-Loss allocations). As stated in last quarter’s letter, we expect to see an increase in
our VaR during Q1 2017 primarily through a combination of new manager allocations and a pick-up in
overall market volatility due to macro events on the horizon. We expect the Trump Presidency, additional

interest rate hikes by the Fed, and global geopolitical catalysts (e.g. elections, referendums) in 2017 to
contribute to a rise in market volatility. These factors should help us to approach our target daily VaR of
0.80%, and also provide an attractive environment for many of our strategies to generate alpha. While
having more risk on the balance sheet does imply that our return volatility and drawdowns will be larger, it
is reasonable to expect that any positive returns would increase as well.

For the fourth quarter of 2016, 42% of “Fundamental L/S,” 45% of “Quantitative,” and 67% of
“Other” managers were profitable.
The top five performing managers contributed 38% of the quarterly total positive return, with the
largest single manager positively contributing 9%. The bottom five performing managers made up
56% of negative returns, with the largest single manager negatively contributing 17%.
While 2015 was a stronger year for our strategy overall compared to 2016, we were pleased to see
a continual diversification of return attribution across our managers in 2016. The below statistics
compare 2016 with 2015 and present a similar picture of limited return concentration.
