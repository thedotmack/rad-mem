Wearing a rainbow-striped hoodie and a "Beer Nuts" baseball cap, Sarah Silverman strode into our 
Burbank recording studio ready to talk. 
It had been just a few weeks since Hulu had unceremoniously canceled her weekly show I Love You,  
America and the comedian's emotions were still a bit raw. But her unflappable sense of humor was 
fully intact as she recounted to me how she found out the bad news and ended up revealing more than 
ever before about how the streaming service treated her over the past year. 
During our long conversation for the first-ever episode of my new podcast The Last Laugh, Silverman 
also spoke frankly about what it has been like to see her friend Al Franken accused of alleged sexual

misconduct and attempted to clarify the controversial comments she made to Howard Stern about 
Louis C.K. She reflected on some of her most iconic roles and looked ahead to what comes next. 
Highlights from the interview are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing 
to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts. 
On the 'heartbreaking' cancelation of I Love You, America 
"It came as a surprise. We were so sure we were getting picked up. We're all super bummed about it. I 
know that they did love the show, but I think what it cost compared to its popularity or the eyes that 
they had on it didn't___you know, the people that make the decisions there don't have any connection to 
the show. And it is just so heartbreaking because I kind offeel cut off at the knees."

On the 'bullshit' allegations against Al Franken 
"I can only just be honest and say, if I didn't know Al Franken, I'd probably be like yeah, go girl, me 
too, fuck that shit. Because I do know him, I don't feel that way. So maybe I'm too close to it and just 
seeing the dots not the big picture. But I just can't believe it. The U.S.O. thing is bullshit and if you 
watch the sketch they did, give me a fucking break. He may be guilty of doing pedestrian comedy, I 
guess, but he apologized and she accepted his apology. But it does seem that the Republican Party 
and I don't think this is something to emulate at all___doesn't apologize, denies everything, admits 
nothing and everyone keeps their job. And I hate that that's what we teach our children. But if you 
apologize and say, 'I want there to be an ethics investigation on me and I want to do everything by the 
book, this is my truth but I'm open to [the fact] that these women felt this way, I want to make this 
right,' I don't know why that person then loses their job."

On looking like an 'asshole' after commenting on Louis C.K. 
"My experience with Louis as a teenager perhaps informs his pathology a bit. But in no way is it 
analogous to crimes, to assaults, he subsequently committed that mirror it, that come from it. I was just 
speaking about my own experience. And the headline was, 'He jerked off in front of me and I didn't 
care.' And that's so cold and insulting and awful to the women who were hurt by his actions. So if you 
clicked on it, they quoted me. But if you didn't, and nobody does, it just makes me look like an asshole. 
And me looking like an asshole is the least of it. It hurt people and there was stuff that I said that I 
don't think I was articulating the spirit of what I meant."

Seth Meyers Proves Trump Is the Real 'Husband From Hell'  
"It's such an '80s comedienne premise, but then it was also my truth so I was trying to reconcile with 
it. It's hard to not be meta about it, because just to say 'I'm single' on stage. There's something that 
feels so inherently hacky about it that I feel like I have these guilt pangs and then it just becomes a 
whole other bit. It's always weird to navigate. I've always been in relationships for big chunks of time 
and every time I come out I'm like a generation older and I don't know what my station is."
