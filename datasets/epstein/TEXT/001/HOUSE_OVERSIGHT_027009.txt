
                              AIPAC SPEECH 2013 – MINISTER OF DEFENSE - EHUD BARAK
     •  Thank you for such a warm welcome. 
•  What an indescribable feeling to be surrounded by so many true friends in the capital of the world's greatest democracy.
•  Members of the Administration, Members of Congress, distinguished ambassadors, especially our ambassador Michael Oren…. Michael, Rosey, Bob, David, Howard and Richard, AIPAC members… older and young…
•  Good evening to you all.
•  It is your toil and your graft – your unwavering support – that keep us safe.
•   I have six humble words for all of you:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
•  I would like to express my personal appreciation to President Obama and Secretary Panetta for their resolute backing of Israel.
•  History will surely record your immeasurable contribution to the strength of Israel, and the maintenance of the truly special relationship between our peoples. 
•   On behalf of the people of Israel, I wish Secretary Hagel all the best in his new role.  
•  As Secretary of Defense he will, no doubt, serve his country with the same pride and honor with which he served, both on the battlefield and in Congress. 
•  It is great to see so many young activists here. Thank you for your energetic commitment to Israel! 
•   A commitment which is so lucidly dictated by the head… yet so deeply underpinned by the heart…
•  Keep it up – you are the future! 

************************************

•  It is thanks to the rock solid US-Israel relationship, alongside the devotion of the young men and women of the IDF, that our capacity to defend ourselves, has been guaranteed for years to come!
•   With US support, combined with the ingenuity of our scientists; Israel finds itself at the cutting edge of missile defense technology.
•  The ‘Iron Dome’ recently intercepted over 400 incoming terrorist rockets.  Practically – this is like hitting a bullet… with a bullet!
•  Just last week, we – the US and Israel – conducted a successful exo-atmospheric test of the Arrow 3 interceptor. 
•  The State of Israel simply would not be the strong island of stability it is, without one crucial constant. 
•  You! The United States of America. Its people. Its leadership.  Its Congress. Its Jewish community. 

***********************************

•  It is no secret, and I'll repeat it again, that we live in a tough neighborhood, where there is no mercy for the weak.  And no second chance for those who cannot defend themselves.
•  Israel is the strongest country in the region and the only genuinely open democracy.
•  An unprecedented geopolitical earthquake in the last three years has shattered the generations’ old regional order.
•   There are two clear lessons and one insight which I have drawn from this period:
•  # 1: Be modest with predictions……. especially about the future!  Take Egypt as an example; Mubarak was unable to predict it… who did?  Who thinks he could?

•  #2:  When friends tell me: Don’t worry…  If worse comes to worst … the world will step forward and act!
•   My answer is: Do not take this for granted.
•  Look at Syria – you don't need classified intelligence; it’s on your screens.  Assad’s jet fighters, tanks and artillery are slaughtering his own citizens.  Over 70,000 Syrians killed. 
•  Yet still… there is no sense of direction and no political will to act.
•  There is an extremely relevant lesson here… especially for all of us in Israel. 
•  And an insight…
•  Many believe that the root cause for all the problems in the Middle East… is our inability to solve the conflict with the Palestinians. 
•  Well, I say… That’s not true!
•   Recent developments in the Middle East have been far beyond our control… and independent of our deeds.
•  Even if a peace agreement with the Palestinians had been signed and sealed a long time ago:
     o  The Muslim Brotherhood would still have come to power in Egypt
     o  Syria would still be mired in a bloody civil war
     o  And Iran would still be pursuing nuclear capabilities and a hegemonic role in the Gulf 

•  And ladies and gentlemen,
•   It is Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities which is the greatest challenge facing Israel, the region and the world today… 
•  A nuclear Iran spells the end of any conceivable non-proliferation regime. 
•   Saudi Arabia, Turkey and later Egypt will follow suit.   In the future, even terrorist groups may try.  
•  Diplomatic efforts continue.  Sanctions are unprecedented and hurting, but frankly – while exhausting all diplomatic means is understandable – I do not believe it will lead to a “moment of truth”, where the Ayatollahs will give up their nuclear aspirations.

•  Therefore, all options must remain on the table.

•  We have stated this time and again.

•  And we expect all those who say it… to mean it… 

•  Ladies and gentlemen… We mean it.

•  And let me repeat it: we… mean it.

**************************************

•  A nuclear Iran is the most imminent and acute danger to the stability of the entire region.  But it is not the only one:
•  Radical Islamist terror is spreading rapidly.
•   And the accumulation of missiles and rockets will necessitate regional missile defense. 

•  So what is to be done?
•  It is an interregnum right now in Israel, and the new Netanyahu government will have to shape its approach.
•   But allow me, just before I leave my post, to share with you my positions:
•  The Middle East is a Gestalt – everything depends on everything else.  
•  Facing this array of threats, we have to:
•  Firstly, start building a ‘Regional Security Framework’… 
•  This should be built around the common challenges of radical Islamist terror, border security, missile defense… and of course, Iran.
•  And being led by the United States, it could provide a variety of synergies for all its regional participants.
•  Secondly, we need a daring peace initiative vis-à-vis the Palestinians.
•  A two-state solution is the only viable long-term solution.
•  It is a compelling imperative for us, in order to secure our identity and our future as a Jewish and democratic state; it’s not a favor for the Palestinians… 
•  Believe me, I tried hard as Prime Minister, together with President Clinton.  So I know, from personal experience, that the Palestinians are not easy partners for peace.
•  Prime Minister Netanyahu has taken courageous steps, to renew the process including an unprecedented settlement freeze.
•  But still – from the Palestinian side… no proper response.
•  They clearly bear most of the responsibility for past failures.
•  And I know, a fully fledged agreement is probably not feasible today,  But if this is the case – and only a sincere effort can determine this – we have to try and achieve a reasonable, fair, interim agreement.
•  I strongly believe this is possible, while guaranteeing all our security and vital interests.
•  But if even an interim agreement is unobtainable, then we should consider unilateral steps, in order to place a wedge on this extremely dangerous slippery slope towards a binational state.  
•  It involves demarcating a line within the land of Israel… Within which we will have the settlement blocs and a solid Jewish majority for generations to come.
•  As well as setting security arrangements, and a solid Israeli, long-term military presence along the River Jordan.
•  Rest assured… our security should not – and will not – be compromised under any of these alternatives.
•  Tough decisions must be taken; but it is possible.
•  And as our sages teach us: “If not now… when?”

•  I strongly believe that this intertwined strategic triangle: 
•  First, The Regional Security Framework 
•   Second, a reinvigorated political process with the Palestinians… 
•  And third: tackling Iran.
     •  This triangle, is the most effective approach to deal with the challenges on our horizon.

*************************************
•  Israel, has also been experiencing its own tremors of change.
•  In the summer of 2011, the people of Israel took to the streets… demanding a more equal allocation of the burden. 
•  Just last month, 53 new, fresh members of the Knesset were sworn in, about half the serving members of Knesset … (Present company included!)… were out. 
•  That is what I call democracy in action.
•   A democracy I am proud of. 
•   A democracy you can be proud of.
•  I am confident that Prime Minister Netanyahu will lead his new government with the same dedication and responsibility which he led the last.

•  Ladies and gentlemen,
•   I was born 71 years ago, at the height of World War II; the Nazi crematoria in Europe were working day and night.
•  And now… in 2013, I am ending my tenure as the Minister of Defense of a strong, independent Jewish state. 
•   Look at what we – as a nation – have achieved… Who would have believed it then?
     o  Today we have an agile and adaptive high-tech and export oriented economy. 
     o  A start-up culture flourishes on an eruption of talent and an underlying entrepreneurial spirit.

•  I am optimistic, and my vision for Israel is clear:
•  A strong, self-confident, thriving Jewish, democratic state, living in peace and security with its neighbors.
•  An exemplary state and world leader in science, technology, education and culture.
•  A country in which our children will want to live, and your children will be proud of. 

•  Ladies and gentlemen,
•   We are at a decisive juncture in our history… 
•  As President Kennedy noted during the Cuban Missile Crisis:
     o  "The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all paths are.  But it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation…"
•  I believe we possess the character and courage as a nation to make those tough decisions for the future, peace and security of the State of Israel.  
•  Please allow me to end with the millennia old blessing:
     o  השם עוז לעמו ייתן, השם יברך את עמו בשלום
•  May the Lord bestow his people with courage; may the Lord bless his people with peace. 
•  Thank you…
