BREAKING NEWS 
Summers withdraws from Fed race 
Lawrence Summers has taken himself out of the running to be the next chair of 
the Federal Reserve, withdrawing his name after opposition from key Democratic 
senators indicated they would oppose his nomination. 
Mr Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and senior economic adviser to 
Barack Obama in his first term, galvanised opposition among left-of-centre 
Democrats who painted him as symbol of the wrongs of financial deregulation.
