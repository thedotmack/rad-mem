Jeffrey, 
For taping in Cambridge? For breakfast and taping at my house. Depends on what woody is up for. My ideal 
would be a 1/2 hour-40 minute conversation, but we could do a quick taping in 15 minutes ...my team can be 
ready 
And , just to remind,could also come to do taping in ny on 24th because I'm coming to New York the evening 
of 23rd for a YIVO event--to which you would both be most welcome I'm sure (YIVO is the largest collection 
of materials from Jewish Eastern Europe)

Absolutely. 23rd is great. I teach my seminar that day at 1 but could tape in the morning or after class--in 
my office (very private), or at the Harvardx studios (less) or in the Woodberry poetry room (the nicest place). 
. If Woody wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us... 
Woody is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course
