It was not easy as people from LifeBall are very difficult. But I go it (they even now approved you - they 
needed to do a background check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc) 
for two tickets — for you and your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell 
individual seats). 
Guy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. 
The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all 
party access. 
I have the same ones (through Bill). 
I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. 
The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is 
hard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap. 
The plan for for Vienna I am sending you with my next email!

Here is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets. Tell him to use my name and the name of Magdalena 
Schuster on the email below. They've already approved him to buy tickets to Lifeball and the Gala dinner 
which happens right before the ball. I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell 
your friend Jeffrey that he should buy the Mini car for me as a thank you. =) 
I'm getting in to Vienna on Friday afternoon. Let's get together on Friday night. 
See you soon,
