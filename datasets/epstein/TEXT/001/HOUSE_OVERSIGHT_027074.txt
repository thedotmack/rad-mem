ASK
Due to the funding decrease UNFPA is experiencing as the US pulled all their funding under president Trump, and the European countries have re-directed their funding to deal with the migrant influx, there is a funding shortfall leading to Female Condom stock outs in countries. 

The Female Health Company is looking for donors who are willing to donate money to UNFPA, and earmark that money for purchase of the FC2 female condom only, so that they can purchase the FC2 female condom for the following countries:
Uganda : 3 million units		Ghana: 1 million units

Why Female condoms?
The female condom is the only female initiated method that provides triple protection against STIs including HIV and Zika and against unplanned pregnancy
Introduction of male and female condoms in the same market leads to more overall protected sex acts
Cost effective, positive return on investment

                    
                    







HIV/AIDS global overview
• No. 1 cause of death globally for women age 15-44
• 80% of female cases contracted via heterosexual transmission
• Male and female condoms are the only prevention products available

                                        Worldwide, women represent >50% of new  
                                        Adult HIV/AIDS infections
                    
                    







The social case for FC2
Empowering women as a development tool by decreasing maternal mortality & fewer unwanted pregnancies and protecting from HIV-infection, and other STIs

  ▪ Worldwide 215 million women who like to plan or limit number of children have no access to contraception
  ▪ Worldwide 21.6 million unsafe abortions cause 5 million women hospitalized each year, and account for 13 % of maternal deaths
  ▪ Worldwide women and girls account for slightly more than half of all HIV infections
  ▪ In sub-Saharan Africa 23 million people live with HIV/AIDS: over 12 million are women and nearly 2.5 million are children

                    
                    







The product case for fc2
Only FDA and WHO approved Female Condom and as a result approved for bulk procurement by UNFPA and USAID
The strong preference for FC2 due to its non allergenic material nitrile and long standing reputation
FC2 is has been distributed to 144 countries. 
The backup support, materials, training provided by FHC

                    
                    







The product case for fc2 (2)
5) The FC2 female condom, as opposed to the latex male condom, is made out of Nitrile which holds many benefits: 
- Three times stronger than latex, 
- Can be used by people who are latex sensitive, or allergic
- Can hold both water and oil based lubricants (latex tears with oil)
- Can be inserted hours in advance 
- Transfers body heat ensuring a more natural sensation

6) The FC2 is hormone free, which means that it does not have the side effects of  some hormone based contraceptives.

7) Preferable alternative to a male condom, according to males
▪ Men don’t have to wear it
▪ Not tight/restricting
▪ Can be inserted in advance of sexual activity



                    
                    







Debunking myths & Misconceptions
Certain Myths and Misconceptions among decision still exist today, even though the evidence tells otherwise

It is too expensive
There is no demand
We already have male condoms and LARCs so the FC is not necessary
Men do not like the product, and without them it will never succeed
                    
                    







1) It is too Expensive: false
                    “The Business Case for Female Condoms” 
                    (Global Health Visions, 2014)

Return on investment of female condom procurement for governments through 2 ways:
Cost savings to the health system, by focussing on prevention instead of treatment
Economic productivity losses averted, as more women are able to join the workforce. 

                    
                    







The business case for female condoms (2)
	The Business case for female condoms found that for every $1,- invested in buying female condoms in Kenya a return of $1,94 is made. In Nigeria for every $1,- invested a return of $3,20 is made. See table below for health benefits. 

                    
                    







2) There is no demand: False
Uruguay Study, UNFPA Uruguay and MOH Uruguay (2017):
- 77% of average women said the FC2 was good or very good
Study participants cited greater comfort and practicality and greater protection and safety as the two main advantages of the FC2
- 81% said they would continue using the FC2 in the future
- 64 % said they experienced no difficulties at all

South Africa National Female Condom Program 
Evaluation (2017)
- 80% of women feld the FC put them in charge
- The level of unprotected sex declined from 43,3 % at baseline
 to 8,4 % at 12 months after the introduction of the FC

                    
                    







3) We already have other commodities: False
AIGHD Research on the Female Condom in Mozambique (2017)
                    The increase in female condom use was not accompanied by an
                    off-setting decrease in ever or current use of alternative methods.
                    If anything, current use of male condoms and other modern
                    contraceptives increased slightly in the treatment group. Female condoms thus seemed to complement the existing choice set of regular contraceptives

South Africa National Female Condom Program Evaluation (2017)
                     Of the current FC users 73,4% reported using condoms in general more often than before they started using the female condom. 



                    
                    







4) Men do not like the product: false
South Africa National Female Condom Program Evaluation (2017)


- At their one month interview 58% of men said that the FC was better or much better than the MC and at 12 months this rose to 74%
- At six months into the research 97% of women reported that their partners were supportive of using the FC

                    
                    







In summary
Female Condoms provide a return on investment
Female Condoms are in high demand with both men and women, average and key populations
Female Condoms increase the overall use of barrier methods and contraceptives, enforcing  decrease in overall number of unprotected sex acts
