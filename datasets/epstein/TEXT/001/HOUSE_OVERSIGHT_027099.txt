On Iran: How to Repair the Widening American-Israeli Rift 
Ephraim Sneh 
The Islamist takeover in the Middle East and North Africa has created perilous strategic 
turbulence in the region. Consequently, it is now critically important that the United States and 
its few allies cooperate closely. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in recent weeks for US-
Israel relations regarding Iran's nuclear program. The disagreement about attacking Iran's 
nuclear facilities has turned into ugly bickering, much of it disguised. This is harmful for both 
Israel and the United States. 
To heal this rift — which is necessary to effectively address the Iranian threat — we must 
understand the following basic facts: 
1. The Israeli fear of a nuclear Iran is genuine. It is not a political trick of Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu or Defense Minister Ehud Barak. A nuclear Iran would bolster and 
encourage extremist militant forces across the region. The moderates would be discouraged, 
intimidated and invariably weakened to the point where they would be unable to negotiate with 
Israel. In just a few years, Israel will be surrounded by three Pakistan-like' countries: Saudi 
Arabia, Egypt and Turkey. All three would possess nuclear weapons and be dominated 
politically by Islamists. In such a scenario, Israel would lose its strategic advantage in the region. 
It would lose its lead as a country of entrepreneurship and excellence, as foreign investment 
would decline and talented young Israelis would build their future abroad. No responsible Israeli 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 027099 
leader will allow such a nightmare to become a reality. The hateful declarations of Iran's leaders, 
committed to wiping the Jewish state off the map, do not assuage Israelis' fears. 
2. Economic sanctions cannot convince the regime in Teheran to abandon its nuclear project. 
However, sanctions can bring about the collapse of the regime if they are vigorously 
implemented and enforced. 
3. An American military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities would be more effective 
than an Israeli one. But disparaging Israel's capabilities and its military ingenuity, undermining 
its deterrence effect, is a grave mistake. 
4. Israel's operational window is closing. If Israel has to cope alone with the Iranian threat, its 
window of operational opportunity is narrower than the American one. It has to act sooner. 
5. An Israeli military strike in the next two months, contravening repeated demands by the 
U.S. President to postpone it, would be counterproductive. The damage of defying the 
President would be greater than the damage sustained by allowing the Iranian regime an 
additional few months of advancing toward acquiring the bomb. Such a strike may broaden the 
gap between the U.S. and Israel and weaken the alliance, which all previous Israeli Prime-
Ministers have safeguarded as a strategic asset of Israel. 
6. The United States has failed to prevent countries like Pakistan or North Korea from 
obtaining nuclear weapons. This record feeds Israeli skepticism about a U.S. success in the 
case of Iran. This skepticism prevails despite the clear rhetoric and unquestionable commitments 
of the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense to prevent a nuclear Iran. 
7. The fact that the Israeli Prime Minister and the Republican presidential candidate share 
the same political benefactor feeds suspicions in the Obama administration about Netanyahu's 
motives for attacking Iran a few weeks before the U.S. presidential elections. 
8. The regional perspective cannot continue ignoring the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. This issue can no longer be swept under the rug. Maintaining the status quo is politically 
comfortable in the short-run, but it will be combustible and devastating in the long run. 
Achieving the two-state solution will preserve Israel as a Jewish, democratic state. It will end 
Israel's regional isolation. It will rebuild America's standing and influence in the Arab and 
Muslim world. Furthermore, these last two outcomes will strengthen America's and Israel's 
hands in thwarting Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. 
These eight basic facts combine to produce a complex reality. When fully understood, they can 
pave the way to restoring U.S.-Israeli harmony. There is no symmetry between the United States, 
the super-power, and its tiny ally, Israel. But the "package" required from each side in order to 
mend fences has to include the following mutual commitments: 
1. Israel will not attack Iran in 2012. 
2. The United States will hold a joint intelligence estimate session with Israel in the early spring 
of 2013. If the conclusion of this joint estimate is that there is no substantial slow-down of the 
Iranian nuclear project, the U.S. will take military action to destroy this project. 
3. The United States will oppose any attempt to intervene in Israel's strategic capacities and will 
prevent any monitoring of Israel's own strategic installations. At the same time, the United States

will uncompromisingly support Israel's right to preserve and develop its indigenous military 
capacities. 
4. Israel will accept an American invitation to attend a peace conference that will be convened 
in the U.S. no later than mid-2013. This gathering will address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
aiming to resolve it once and for all with an agreed-upon timetable for implementation. 
These four commitments would serve the interests of both the United States and Israel. They 
would enable the U.S. to resume its leadership role of peacemaking in the Middle East. And they 
would provide a basis for binding the U.S. and Israel together as they face these challenging 
times.
