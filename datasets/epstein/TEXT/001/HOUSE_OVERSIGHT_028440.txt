The story was told by Deborah Ramirez, who told Mayer and Farrow that she almost didn’t come forward — even with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court in the balance — because what she had to relate happened one night in college when she’d been drinking.

But her account of how, after getting drunk and high at a party, she was taken to a shed by two boys who penetrated her vaginally and anally, and demanded that she perform oral sex, wasn’t viewed as authoritative. Neither was the investigation that followed it, which included the collection of evidence of her attack and a medical examination at a hospital. Instead, Wyatt was vilified for having caused trouble to her community; vile slurs about her penetrability were spray-painted around her town and at her school; she was sent to finish her education elsewhere, and eventually written off as having made a false accusation, the voice she’d worked so hard to raise quelled, her story recalled as fallacious.

Some of the iron bridles included tongue depressors; some of those had spikes on the bottom to pierce the flesh. When I visited the Tower of London last year, during the week that followed the publication of stories about Harvey Weinstein’s serial sexual predation — told at long last by women whose tongues had been loosed — I saw an internally spiked metal neck collar on display.

During the 2016 primaries, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough chided Hillary Clinton, after a set of primary victories, “Smile. You just had a big night.” And in 2018, commenting on Nancy Pelosi’s grim visage during Trump’s first State of the Union, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on CNN, “I think she should smile a lot more often.” When women like Pelosi and Clinton do open their mouths, they’re quickly cast as shrill and monstrous harpies. Do a Google image search of any powerful women in politics or public life, and you’ll see that their ideological opponents love to show pictures of them with their mouths open, mid-yell, the very act of making a loud noise a sign of their unnatural tendencies; it’s no accident that when he was asking to have her removed from Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings two weeks ago, Orrin Hatch referred to a protester yelling about health care as a “loudmouth.” The best way to discredit threatening women is to capture them giving loud voice to something that we might imagine is uncomfortable to hear.","type":"text"},{"additions":[{"URL":"https://apple.news/AsphunM9BQTqQJAJuthZQug","range":{"length":4,"start":757},"type":"link"}],"identifier":"_anf-body-10","inlineTextStyles":[{"range":{"length":868,"start":0},"textStyle":"_anf-ts-11"}],"layout":"bodyContentLayout","role":"body","text":"And the best way to silence them — besides literally covering their mouths, as Kavanaugh is alleged to have done to Ford, as he was trying to rip her clothes off — is to ensure that their voices are considered illegitimate.

Wyatt, and Ramirez, considered themselves to be outsiders, who had to work to fit into comparatively more privileged circles. To be “the popular girl,” and “one of the cool kids,” Wyatt told Bruenig, she often drank and took drugs.
