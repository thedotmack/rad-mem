Dear Friends, 
PLEASE watch this very important short and incredibly clear video regarding the Iran deal. 
If you have not yet called your congressmen and asked other friends and relatives to do so, PLEASE do that as well. The 
wellbeing of your children and grandchildren depend upon it!

The Iran Nuclear Deal 
Dear Friend, 
This week, our featured video is as urgent as it gets. Just days after President Obama and 
Secretary of State John Kerry announced the nuclear deal with Iran, Dennis Prager was in 
studio recording a video explaining why the deal is so dangerous, and how it parallels what 
happened in 1938 between Great Britain and Nazi Germany. This is the fastest turn-
around time on any video we've released in PragerU's history, but what's at stake is so 
monumentally important, we knew we couldn't waste any time. So please take five minutes 
to watch the video. Forward it to your family, friends, and the offices of your Congressional 
representatives. We all have an obligation to do whatever is in our power to impact as 
many people on this topic as we can.
