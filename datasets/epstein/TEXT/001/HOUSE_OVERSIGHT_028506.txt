Subject: US Saudi Arms deal but Note Blackstone Infrastructure Fund with SAMA 
Terje, the attached article appeared in todays FT, I have removed the defence part related to the US$110bn arms 
deal but highlighted the separate deal done with Blackstone to establish a fund for US infrastructure this is akin 
/ precedent to what we seek to achieve with SAMA focused on global investment fund in Airport Infrastructure 
— Best Richard. 
US President Donald Trump began his first foreign trip with a stop in Saudi Arabia, where a $nobn 
arms package was announced that the White House hopes will help Saudi Arabia and other gulf states 
combat terrorism in the region and ward off threats from Iran. 
US defence companies lifted by Saudi deals 
Lockheed Martin and Boeing stand out after Saudi Arabia signs a 
flurry of deals 
Separately, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has also  
announceo a large investment in US infrastructure 
through a new Blackstone fund. The sovereign Public 
Investment Fund intends to invest $2obn into 
Blackstone's new vehicle, with a further $2obn coming 
from other investors. The group's stock price rose 6.7 per 
cent to $31.88.
