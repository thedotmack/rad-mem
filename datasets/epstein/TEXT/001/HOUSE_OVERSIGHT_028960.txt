Very interesting topics. Would like to hear more from you about them, when we have a chance. Is it worldwide, or 
mostly here? 
My impression is that the fear is mostly in the US. There's nothing in (much more vulnerable) Europe comparable to the 
Visa Waiver program (insanely targeting Iran, which has not been involved in terrorism, while exempting Saudi Arabia, 
the source of almost all jihadi terrorism). Or Trump-style ban them all. Or Cruz-style carpet-bomb them. For a long 
time, probably back to colonial days, this has been a very frightened country, maybe the safest in the world but also the 
most frightened. Impressions. 
Sometimes it's quite weird. By accident, I took the first flight PanAm 103 after the Lockerbie bombing, together with an 
old friend, a veteran Middle East correspondent. It must have been the safest flight in human history. The plane was 
empty. We were bumped up to first class because there was no one there.

travel, commodity prices way down, little building. luxury market decimated. no russians or chinese

these at least, i can speak with a modicum of knowledge )

This is the program David Marr initiated, developed by Shimon Ullman and others. Makes sense, and there are some 
interesting results. David was a friend, and we often discussed these topics. In fact, his famous three levels adapted a 
model from generative grammar. But there was always the fundamental problem I mentioned. Vision is an input 
system, crafting coherent images from lines, points of light, etc. Language is used for that purpose too, but it's not 
what language is. 
That fundamental difference, along with the fact that the principles involved seem quite different, has always been a 
stumbling block to seeking any link.

We don't teach children language either, contrary to many beliefs. The visual grammar just grows, and as is known, 
can develop in various ways depending on early experience. Same with the language grammar, though the period in 
which experience has a shaping effect is much longer. 
However, there are fundamental differences between vision and language. Can send you a recent paper about it if 
you like. Vision is an input system. Language isn't. It's an internal capacity, a system of knowledge, which is used to 
process input and also to produce thoughts (sometimes externalized). Seems also to be modality independent. And 
their properties look wholly different, so it's hard to see how one could piggy-back on the other.

we dont teach children to see. they have a visual grammar built in. why wouldnt we expect some mutation 
of that system to allow auditory grammar.
