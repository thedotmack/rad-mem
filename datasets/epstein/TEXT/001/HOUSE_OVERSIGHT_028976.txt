Subject: woody and deadline 
Importance: High 
Dear Jeffrey, 
Woody has received from his lawyer some questions I asked in in response to the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum 
sent me... .1 found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and I'm excited to go forward, but I do need 
those clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than 
Bill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after five years. 
The Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next 
week-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing 
The television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and 
they've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want Woody to be one of those. 
I'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by 
computer.
