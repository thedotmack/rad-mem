Hey Jeffrey, 
Thought I'd check in and see what's up on your end. 
- I've been watching closely Trump's appointees and there, he might be putting Balaji (a big 
bitcoiner) as FDA head, and Allison seems to be somewhat in favor of something like Bitcoin. 
And of course, Thiel has said that Bitcoin is what Paypal should have been... Curious to hear 
where your head is at on this matter. 
- Last week, I presented my research at Stanford's BPASE, it was well received. The most 
interesting thing I came up with for that is an inverse-input contract; i.e., funds that are "locked" to 
be spent only in the case where there are other funds that are not used in a specific way. An 
example of something that could be built with this: a matching donation contract, where you 
agree to donate your money to charity if someone else donates to charity, and you would not be 
able to release your funds from that agreement until they use their funds not for charity. 
- I'm in Japan this week, teaching a class to 100 Japanese Engineers to get the up to speed on 
bitcoin (with DG). It's very interesting to see the trepidation first hand that they have with respect 
to the technology, despite their debit-based society being more geared for it in any case (DG felt 
that even putting Bitcoin in the course name would scare away students). One of my friends (a 
hedge fund manager) told me that female japanese engineers are very good, and drastically

under-valued. I made sure to get a few invited to the class, we'll see if he's right. On the whole, it 
will be interesting to see the caliber of engineer Japan has to offer on this front. 
Best, 
Jeremy
