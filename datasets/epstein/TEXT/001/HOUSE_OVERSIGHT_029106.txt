Friends for three decades, Trump whisperer says he is 
'stunned' by president's rhetoric 
Billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr. has done what few others in Trump's orbit have 
done: He told the president, in effect, that he was wrong. "In my opinion, he's better 
than this," Barrack said. 
Trump's relationship with Barrack is one of the most important, if little understood, of 
the president's life, offering a case study of what it takes to remain close to him in a 
time of such turmoil.
