Terrific; looking forward. 
Excited to go through math candidates on the list, others too. 
Equally important, discuss edits/modifications to the 13 episodes (cutting blahs), expanding math episodes - see 
below. Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians. 
How's late afternoon after 5:30 pm / early evening today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today - 
mother 102 in May.) 
RADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new) 
Expand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes 
1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance 
2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories 
3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry, biology 
[molecular and evolutionary[, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.) 
4. Power Laws 
5. Mathematical Biology 
6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?) 
ADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes 
9/10. Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in 
biomedical and psychological research - the scandal in recent years.

In the non-Closer To Truth world.... 
Did CNN Intl this morning on Trump's China-oil-N.Korea-cheating tweet "Caught RED HANDED..." 
[pun deliberate] 
My favorite fun lines (there are so many) in Trump's NYTimes spontaneous interview. 
2) "I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of 
China." 
Ever (-5,000 year history) 
1) "I know the details of taxes better than anybody___better than the greatest CPA." 
Not, mind you, CPAs in general, not even smart Jewish CPAs who work all the time - but whoever, out 
of 664,532 actively licensed CPAs (2016), is the greatest CPA of them all (#1 in citing code? creative 
deductions?) - better than him!

lets talk today. I went through the candidates in math. . we should talk, I have great hopes for this and am 
sure you woudl want to get it right though some of the math people write well , their speakinn style and 
presence is less than A , and probaby closer to a C +/ . Im around today or hte weekend if you would like to 
chat.

`Blahblahs' forbidden in 'Radical Breakthroughs'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science and 
Rare Sentience). 
Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode "Mathematics and Truth" into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, general 
systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three episodes 
could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. Also, Closer 
To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 episodes!), so this would 
be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the series. 
* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un of Wisconsin-
Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my expertise, 
but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you need to tell me 
if you would like to include this.

* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in biomedical 
and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

* Other possibile areas you suggest 
We would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth 'season' of 
13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs', which we need to plan well in advance - especially as we begin 2018. 
See you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming.

great work , but needs some editing, did not like multi verse and sensience. seems more blahblah

Hi: When are you back in NY? 
Attached is the complete Preproduction Book for Radical Breakthroughs - now including Misha Gromov! 
Love your feedback, suggestions. 
Also attached is the budget and timing of funding, as presented originally, now updated for the completion of 
preproduction (phase I). We are ready to go into production (phase II). See Budget, p. 4. Committed and 
excited. 
When to meet?
