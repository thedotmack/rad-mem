dear men 
Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] 
i am writing you both because i am attaching a still not-quite-complete response to Peter Richerson, a gene-
culture co-evolutionist—without the genes 
i do so because four lines down i tell the "Gruterites"—Gordon Getty's echo chamber—that i have added you 
two to the list 
so here is your chance to say "no way" and i will delete that from the message and likewise not ask Gruter's 
assistant to add your names to the list 
having said that, i find Gordon's missives much less burdensome than those from EDGE and certainly without 
the egomaniacal nonsense that infects John Brockman—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and have 
them tell each other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense 
neither David nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way—most of what we do is simply 
concentrated sustained thought directed toward the foundations of a problem 
i doubt Jeffrey has made a huge amount of money via the EDGE program 
unless you say otherwise, i will shortly send you the key Getty missives in which he asserts, i believe correctly, 
that Trump is an archetypal narcissistic psychopath—or whatever the precise term is—and that he must be 
opposed with full force on that basis 
meanwhile, David has heard plenty about you Jeffrey, a financial/mathematical mind of exceptional quality and 
you should know that David is one of the very top evolutionary geneticists still breathing and my teacher on 
every detail large and small 
in haste and all best
