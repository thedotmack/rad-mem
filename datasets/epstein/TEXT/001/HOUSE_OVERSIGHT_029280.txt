Dear Joi, 
Hello, I'm writing from Politico Magazine, where we're working on a special package of stories timed to Donald Trump's 
inauguration in January, and I wondered if you would be interested in contributing. 
As he prepares to take office, our plan is to publish a handful of out-of-the box ideas for President Trump, suggested by 
writers and thinkers from a variety of fields and ideological positions. Whether the idea has to do with politics, policy, 
personnel or governing style, we're looking for suggestions that are specific and, above all, surprising; something inventive if 
slightly far-fetched is better than a pet cause or a well-trod policy proposal. (This exercise doesn't require that you support or 
even agree with Trump, but it does require a willingness to engage.) 
Do you have an idea along these lines that you wish the new president would consider, whether something in economics or 
otherwise? If so, I'd love to hear, and we can discuss next steps from there. Ultimately, we're aiming to publish a handful of 
short pieces (about 800 words each) as a package of proposals. 
Many thanks, and please let me know if you have questions.
