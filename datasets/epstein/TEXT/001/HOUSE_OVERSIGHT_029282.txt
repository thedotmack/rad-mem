a HUGE donor advised fund is an elegant solution to the cuts trump proposes to what some consider critical 
programs. you could organzie a huge public charity that would continue the work of many worthwhile 
orgs. not my thing but structurally beautiful. its the wealthiest now stepping into a quasi govt 
funding. national endowment for arts. climate science. as extraordinary amounts of wealth have moved 
into private hands. elons and jeff space goals should be mirrored with many other former govt ones. hope 
to see you soon
