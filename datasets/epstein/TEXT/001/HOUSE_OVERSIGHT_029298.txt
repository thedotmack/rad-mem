Dear Ms. Knowles-Carter, 
Tel: 
Fax: 
I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in America 
(poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first season's guests included Bill Clinton, 
Joe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie 
Hancock, John McCain, Nas, Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, 
Stuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson, and many others. Seasons Two and Three will feature just 
as distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations everywhere, 
streams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is now also airing on a 
variety of domestic and international airlines. 
The poem we'd read and interpret together is by the contemporary poet Evie Shockley, 
and it's called "you can say that again, billie." It's a brilliant and beautiful poem that 
speaks back to Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" and evokes a whole history of gender and 
race in the American South. You are the ideal reader for this poem. We would use what 
we filmed together in an upcoming season of Poetry in America. We would also use the 
content in materials that we are creating for K-12 classrooms in partnership with Harvard. 
Everything we create would be educational and non-commercial. 
Thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work with you. 
Sincerely, 
Elisa New
