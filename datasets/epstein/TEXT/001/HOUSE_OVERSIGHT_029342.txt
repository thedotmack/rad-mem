Dear Jeffrey-
We are thrilled to announce that we are working with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, one of the rising stars in 
the New York Congressional delegation. Sometimes referred to as "Brooklyn's Barack", he is a staunch 
supporter of President Obama and a progressive voice for the people of New York City. NY1 did a profile piece 
about his work on the vitally important Budget and Judiciary committees in Washington. You can watch the  
video here  or read the text below. 
Hakeem is committed to electing a Democratic majority in 2014 and is encouraging his friends to participate in 
the DCCC/DSCC fundraising dinner with President Obama this coming Monday night. Shoot us an email or 
give us a call at (212) 531-2858 if you would like to get involved with the dinner, or would like to get an 
opportunity to get to know Hakeem better. He is an impressive guy and who will be a progressive voice in New 
York politics for years to come. 
Thanks, 
Darren Rigger, Lisa Rossi & Walter Swett

NY!: Hakeem Jeffries Positions Himself For Long Career In Washington 
Apr 29, 2013 
By: Michael Scotto 
Hakeem Jeffries is only about four months into his freshman year in Congress but he's already positioning 
himself for a long career in Washington. NY 1 's Michael Scotto filed the following report. 
If you're looking to knock Hakeem Jeffries off message, you won't get very far. 
"There's a hip hop song, every day I'm hustling, and I kind of feel that way down here in Washington," Jeffries 
said. "In a positive manner, of course."

The freshman congressman from Brooklyn and a sliver of Queens is an ambitious work horse who always 
appears to have his eye on the prize. 
"I'll be shuffling back and forth between budget and judiciary for the better part of the morning, making sure we 
time it correctly so that I'm able to ask questions in both situations," he said. 
He's a big change from Congressman Ed Towns, who retired after holding the seat for 30 years. 
On any given day, Jeffries is traveling through the Capitol, attending hearings on the Judiciary and Budget 
committees, two of the most prominent in the lower chamber. 
For Jeffries, those two assignments allow him to serve as a counterweight to the Republican leadership and to 
talk up the President, whom he and his district overwhelmingly support. 
"My job, I believe, is to help the administration of Barack Obama help us back at home," Jeffries said. 
In his first four months, Jeffries has championed himself as a progressive, introducing legislation to help student 
loan recipients and voting against a bill Friday to ease the impact of automatic spending cuts to the FAA 
because it didn't stop cuts to programs that are impacting the poor. 
In the months and years ahead, Jeffries says there's plenty to do. 
"There's no shortage of the people's business down in Washington, D.C. and that's why the job is one that is a 
serious endeavor," he said. 
A serious endeavor that is also very much on message.
