Dear Jeff, 
I read the news papers today, I can't believe they arrested you again, you are the only man on the planet who 
would never be bad with any women as you love them too much. 
It is so untrue what they are saying. If you need my support I am there. 
I was 19 when I meet you with our wonderful commun friend HRH Prince Andrew and you would have never 
done anything wrong to me. 
I meet the few lovely girls around you, they loved you and you were so good with them. They were bringing 
you ideas, creativity, a touch of youth in this very difficult world and happiness like a young can do. 
Nothing more! Then of course I am sure they were happy to hope to become your girlfriend as women are 
always attracted by men of power! 
I traveled with you to discuss my future in business, you introduced me amongst the most important scientists 
and neuroscientists in the world at Harvard University and you kindly advise me to continue to study. You also 
explained to me that life is hard and business is difficult.You were feeling I should study more. All your advises 
were so right. Thank you. 
I feel sorry that these girls are only interested by your money. I feel sorry for that and they might be 
manipulated by people of power who wish to do bad to the Trump gouvernement. 
Do you remember that you asked me to be your girlfriend, I was back in France after our trip together in 
Harvard, you tried to convince me on the phone, I refused and look today we stayed friends for ever. You never 
did anything wrong as these girls are mentioning, it was up to them to be involved with you sexually, it was 
their own decision, not your wish. 
I don't know if you will read this message. I hope so. 
Please receive my warmest wishes and love.
