Subject: Donald Trump, Kanye West, and the diagnosis of Bipolar Disease 
Importance: High 
Given your interest in Creativity: 
Did you see the entire Kanye West soliloquy in the Oval Office with Trump and Jim Brown? I am using that 
clip in my Talent & Creativity class when we discuss "Creativity & Psychopathology." In Psychiatry, the formal 
terms that apply are "flight of ideas," "pressured speech," "delusions of grandeur,", and "clang associations." A 
truly great example of Hypomania. There's an interesting book on hypomania and success in America today.
