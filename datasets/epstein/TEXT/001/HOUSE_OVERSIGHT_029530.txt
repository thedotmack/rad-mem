Jeffrey, 
Need your advice. 
My finance minister is telling me that he has an anonymous funds manager who is willing to deposit 4 billion 
dollars in Maldives and that they are willing to lend a percentage of that in exchange for government 
promissory notes. The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us to set up a special 
purpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company 
can only be set up under a presidential decree. 
I am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount 
lent. 
I don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the 
finance minister to meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a 
large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable about 
this. 
What do you think I should do. I am very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading politician 
and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for presidency. 
Does this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing. 
Best regards 
Waheed

Maldives just got elected Vice President of International Renewable Energy Agency. We are also Vice Chair 
of the UN Human Rights Council. Not too bad considering we had so much bad coverage this year 
internationally. 
Best regards,

Hi, 
The campaign team is starting to come together. We are continuing discussions with Jim and tomorrow we 
will meet him face to face on skype. We will brief him on the situation here so that he will be able to advice 
us more effectively. Already he has sent some very useful suggestions and we are working on them. 
Getting the right people to head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able to 
pull the team together shortly. 
We will need some more help from Ian and Rory because we are still weak on international 
communication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But most 
of the international media is not paying much attention to Maldives right now. 
I have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to stay here for about a year to work with 
me. He doesn't have to be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is 
also happening now and we need the world to know about them. 
World Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. I am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes. 
I have some funding now but will ask all friends to help raise more later when things start happening in full 
swing. Election is now scheduled to early September. 
Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you here in the not too distant future. 
Warm regards, 
Waheed
