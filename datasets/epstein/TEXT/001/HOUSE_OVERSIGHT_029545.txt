Understand the two negatives are still present. We are still on track per our last call of 60 days from 1/10 if we 
can get the placement out next week Christina is preparing for us and results continue to respond as they have 
been. 
It takes 30 days for Google to respond in most cases and we ramped up 28 days ago with boosting alternate 
URLs per our call 
We are working very hard to make this happen and should have Christina set up to support us with columns on 
a few top sites at no cost moving forward 
I am available for a call now or this weekend to review.

Thank you Christina - I tried your cell a few minutes ago and will be available on mine at your convenience. It 
is imperative we get a placement out by mid next week in order for us to hit the timeline I spoke to Mr. Epstein 
about.. The fresh piece needs to come out while we are dislodging the current results (as you are observing 
now). 
Mr. Epstein if you have any questions on current status vs. our conversation around Jan 10. please advise - We 
are continuing to work aggressively to clean up results per our last call. I am also available to discuss this at 
your convenience today or over weekend. 
Sincerely,

Subject: Re: boosting strategy 
We are pushing up the highest authority domains available for "Jeffrey Epstein" in general. I had reserved the 
approach of pushing non-website URLs for a few months because you expressed concern with making sure 
our URLs are on first page... but I had call w/ Mr. Epstein in the beginning of January and expressed that is a 
limiting factor for moving Forbes/NYPost as quickly as we'd like. 
Getting up different types of results for different folks is required to dislodge the negative placements. Once 
they are dislodged it is much easier to restore our websites back to the rankings and have our "ideal" first 
page. The reason for this is Google tracks click data on results and as soon as Forbes/NYPost are on second 
page they will begin a slow death (less clicks on those, more clicks on the ones we have on first page) 
From there we will see our properties shoot up due to the interlinking between them and the reinforcement we 
can provide from sites like Harvard, Nat Geo, and any other publications we have influence over. Using the 
"short-term" links is one battle around other pages is just a part of the overall war... You saw how Google was 
changing up much more dramatically when we had multiple Epstein's on the first page vs. having a saturated 
first page. 
I feel like time was lost focusing on making sure it was Mr. Epstein properties when he has giving explicit 
permission to promote any URL required to dislodge the negatives. 
I hope this makes sense.. I haven't heard from Rich on the last invoice I sent (1/29/14) and am hoping all is 
well. Do you know if he's out of the office ?

I see that you're boosting non-website url's -- are you sure this is the right approach? (vs. boosting Jeffrey's sites?) the 
.org and foundation sites are slipping down and the USVI and science are permanently off the first page. 
Thanks for you input.
