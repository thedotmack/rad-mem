English is a difficult language......for some! 
This is a true story from the Japanese Embassy in US!!! 
A few days ago, Prime Minister Mon was given some 
Basic English conversation training before he visits 
Washington and meets president Barack Obama... 
The instructor told Mon Prime Minister, 
when you shake hand with President Obama, please say 'how r u'. 
Then Mr. Obama should say, 'I am fine, and you?' Now, you should 
say 'me too'. Afterwards we, translators, will do the work for you.' 
It looks quite simple, but the truth is... 
When Mori met Obama, 
he mistakenly said 'who r u?' Instead of 'How r u?..) 
Mr. Obama was a bit shocked but still managed to react with humor: 
'Well, I'm Michelle's husband, ha-ha..' 
Then Mon replied 'me too, ha-ha...'. 
Then there was a long silence in the meeting room.
