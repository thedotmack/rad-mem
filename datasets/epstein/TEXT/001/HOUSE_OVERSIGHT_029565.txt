attached a message i just sent to President Struppa of Chapman—i am certain that your gift will do the trick—
and that the West Coast is indeed more convivial and supportive than the East 
i hope i did not f... up your contact with Finkelstein 
Carlos told me of the devastation to your island—pretty much as i feared 
am amused (at a safe distance) as Bannon takes on Trump—he responds as he always does, threatening a suit 
he will not in fact file 
no internet in my home or nearby in the great, retarded country of Jamaica so i am now at a restaurant some 35 
minutes away and only go on-line twice a day—hoping that i will work instead 
all best
