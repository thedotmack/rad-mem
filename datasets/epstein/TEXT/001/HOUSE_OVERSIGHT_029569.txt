can you give me a little bit of phrasing you think is optimal? I'm not sure I know how to ask her to join this 
company without asking her to be 
part of poetry in america. It does also seem to me perhaps relevant that Serena thinks of herself as a poetry 
person. 
For people who think that way, maybe not nothing (hasn't been nothing to others) that a Harvard poetry 
professor seeks her wisdom on the art form? 
Would really appreciate your edit.

this poem about childbirth and is not for children. 
It's for adults and it raises awareness on the issues of discrimination against women athletes in sports 
,and, against women of color in childbirth. These are Serena's big issues now.

Dear Jeffrey, 
Here is an invitation you can forward. Fingers crossed. 
I'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to 
Australia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next 
time you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029569 
themes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a 
young girl. 
Thank you for this help with Serena. I'm so sorry about what happened with WA. I will keep the 
"bootleg" episode and hope to release someday. It's so good, and he was so kind to read the poem with 
me and you were so kind to make it happen.
