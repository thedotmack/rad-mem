it would go something like this. ............... 1 Donald doesn't really own very much, he rents out his name. he 
puts it on buildings projects etc. for a royalty or piece of the upside. he then claims the asset is " his " . its 
very much like hyatt hotels. it says Hyatt hotel on the front but it is owned by someone else. ( sometimes by 
Hyatt but not often). Hyatt receives 3 percent per year of revenue and a piece of the profits sometimes if the 
hotel is sold at a profit. . 
money launderers. need a name to purchase trophy properties. why? there is little suspicion if a 
famous wealthy person buys a property that is likely to show in the press. , it cant be jojo my driver, up 
front , so they approach wealthy people and tell them for 2 -5 million dollars for doing nothing at all. - just 
lend us your name . - and the person get the positive press. so and so bought the most expensive 
painting, sold the most expensive painting, house., diamond. etc. -ex the GANZ art collection was bought 
and sold by Joe Lewis. . all the publicity was the ganz family estate. selling etc. 
hypothetically, . someone approached trump and said can you buy the palm beach house. in your 
name. ( it was trump properties 11c ) , not sure who actually owns the 11c. ? Donald can get a loan from a 
bank , but it is guaranteed by, an entity controlled by R R has a bvi co. xitrans. that is owned by a family 
trust. ( cyprus ). R wife settles in oct after trump anounces candidacy. the Ilc agreement or the loan 
agreement allows Donald to get a few million for his name. . R in essence is the" owner. ". he was part of 
the panama papers release. he also sold the da vinci to mbs. . ? if you are a gangster , where and how can 
you invest money. answer not through the front door. 
Donald's financial disclosures are the same , he represents his " income " as the GROSS receipts of his 
clubs." , means nothing at all ZERO. no income as we no it. 
he lists his " assets" ,and their VALUE - but not the corresponding loans, against it. so no net number 
, hence meaningless.
