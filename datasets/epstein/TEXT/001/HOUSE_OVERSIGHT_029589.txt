Dear Ms. Williams:

I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest on my public 
television series, Poetry in America (poetryinamerica.org). If you 
agree, we'll spend 45 minutes at a location of your choice 
discussing a contemporary poem by Sharon Olds that compares 
feats of athletic prowess to childbirth. I will use what we capture in 
an upcoming season of Poetry in America, and I'll also use this 
content in a course for medical professionals I am creating in 
partnership with Harvard Medical School. 
Poetry in America's first season's guests included Joe Biden, 
Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, 
Herbie Hancock, John McCain, Bill Clinton, Nas, Angela Duckworth, 
Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, Stuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson 
as well as 12 of the most distinguished poets of our time. Seasons 
Two and Three will have a similar line up. The series air on most 
public television stations, streams on Amazon Prime and is now 
airing on a variety of domestic and international airlines. I thank 
you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work 
with you. 
Sincerely, 
Elisa New
