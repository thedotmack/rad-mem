Dear Ms. Williams: 
Tel: 
Fax: 
I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest on my public television 
series, Poetry in America (poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first 
season's guests included Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille 
O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie Hancock, John McCain, Nas, 
Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, Stuart Weitzman, E.O. 
Wilson and many others. In Seasons Two and Three we will have just as 
distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations 
everywhere, streams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is 
now also airing on a variety of domestic and international airlines. 
The poem I'd like to read and interpret with you is by Pulitzer Prize winner, 
Sharon Olds, and it's called "The Language of the Brag." It's a gutsy poem that 
compares feats of (male) athletic prowess-- and feats of poetic prowess-- to 
childbirth. You are the ideal reader for this poem: indeed, I picked it for the 
season in hopes you would be my co-interpreter. If you agree to film with me, 
I'll use what we capture in an upcoming season of Poetry in America. I'll also 
use the content in an online course for medical professionals I am creating in 
partnership with Harvard Medical School. 
I thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work 
with you. 
Sincerely, 
Elisa New
