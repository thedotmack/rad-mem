        A guy's walking down the boardwalk in Atlantic City and he runs into a hooker.
        He says, "How much?"
        She says "A hundred bucks."
        He says, "All right."
        They climb down under the boardwalk and he bangs her. The next night, he runs into the same hooker, they go under the boardwalk, only this time while he's banging her, she blasts two incredible farts. When they get done, he hands her a hundred and twenty dollars.
        She says, "What's the extra twenty?"
        He says, "That's for blowing the sand off my balls."

        Mrs. Hartke comes home after visiting her relatives for two weeks and finds that her husband, who was too lazy to go to the supermarket, has eaten all the dog food in the house.
        She calls the doctor and says, "Doc, you have to do something. My husband ate a half a case of dog food."
        The doctor says, "Relax, Mrs. Hartke, it can't hurt him. There's nothing to worry about."

        The doctor says, "Dead? From eating dog food? I can't understand it. What happened?"
        She says, "He was lying in the driveway licking his balls and I backed the car over him."
