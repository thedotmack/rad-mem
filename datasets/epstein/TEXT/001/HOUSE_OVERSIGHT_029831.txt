> The attached lawsuit was filed this week in federal court in California alleging that Jeffrey Epstein 
and another man, Donald Trump, raped her in 1994. We're planning to publish a story on the suit this 
afternoon, and we want to make sure it is fair. Is Mr. Epstein available to speak? Or do you want to 
offer a comment on this behalf?
