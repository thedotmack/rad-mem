Hi Marty, 
The attached lawsuit was filed this week in federal court in California alleging that Jeffrey Epstein and another 
man, Donald Trump, raped her in 1994. We're planning to publish a story on the suit this afternoon, and we 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029833 
want to make sure it is fair. Is Mr. Epstein available to speak? Or do you want to offer a comment on this 
behalf? 
My number is and I'm available any time. I also just tried your cell phone. 
Thank you in advance.
