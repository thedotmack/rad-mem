Hi Reid, 
Ashley Parker here at the Washington Post. I cover the White House and am emailing because my colleague, Bob Costa, 
and I getting ready to post a story about President Trump's decision to move ahead with retaining outside counsel, and 
we understand you're one of the finalists for the role, and have already spoken with senior White House officials. I just 
wanted to let you know that we plan to mention your name (and of course see if you want to comment), and I also 
wanted to check and see if you were open to chatting totally off the record, just in case there is any nuance or guidance 
you'd like to provide. I'm at or my desk is 
Thanks, 
Ashley
