Subject: WaPo story-- Trump's outside counsel 
Hi Reid, 
Ashley Parker here at the Washington Post. I cover the White House and am emailing because my colleague, 
Bob Costa, and I getting ready to post a story about President Trump's decision to move ahead with retaining 
outside counsel, and we understand you're one of the finalists for the role, and have already spoken with senior 
White House officials. I just wanted to let you know that we plan to mention your name (and of course see if 
you want to comment), and I also wanted to check and see if you were open to chatting totally off the record, 
just in case there is any nuance or guidance you'd like to provide. I'm at or my desk is 
Thanks, 
Ashley
