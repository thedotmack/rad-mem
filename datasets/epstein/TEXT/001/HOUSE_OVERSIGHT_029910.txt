You have to be a bit of a wonk to know some of the names, but Nye, Scowcroft and Nick Burns run it (Scowcroft being 
replaced by Condi). Members include Patraeus, Albright, Slaughter, Donalon (Obama NSA), Hadley (Bush NSA), Sullivan 
(NSA Hillary), Bill Burns (State #2), Kurt Campbell, Hoss Carwright (#2 it Chiefs), Harman, Ignatius, Sanger, Nunn, Reed, 
Sawers (M16), Sherman (iran deal), Work (current #2 DoD). It seems to now be taking on an aura. 
Looking for a time to come catch up in NY.
