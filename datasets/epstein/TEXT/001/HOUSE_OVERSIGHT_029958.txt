Hi Jeffrey, 
I got more votes than Jeb Bush got in Iowa, and I only had one congressional district, he had four!! It's so funny (to me — 
totally embarrassing to him)!!! Still like Trump 0 and might be a delegate to the republican convention. 
Was in St. Thomas for a couple of days — did call this island, but never heard back. Went scuba diving off St. Jeff and it 
was beautiful. Would be totally funny (to me at least) if you put a big fake shark or statute under the water where the 
divers go.... 
Love ya,
