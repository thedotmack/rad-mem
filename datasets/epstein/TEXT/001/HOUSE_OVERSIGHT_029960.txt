Hi Jeffrey, 
Hope all is well with you. Enjoying this political climate ? I moved from the Trump campaign to Kasich 
as there was a fabulous opportunity to be on his Advisory Committee for Elder Issues. Now, I'm going to try 
to get on with Trump as an advisor. He's going to have big problems with Trump University and the charge of 
Senior Financial Abuse in CA and FL. 
Also, starting a new company helping Seniors age successfully, especially individuals with dementia - the 
earlier we catch it the better. I've been working with a memory center and individuals in DC and it's 
remarkable the results I've been able to achieve over the last year. Of course, only want to work with 
people/families/guardians that are SERIOUS about getting the best care. I stress 'serious' because I don't want 
to get into a situation like as last summer. 
How is Fred? It's just sad sad sad that instead of letting me help him, Joe had me fixing his watch and finding 
a school for his son... I think of where Fred could be today, and instead he's probably locked up in his 
apartment with no help that has dementia training — he probably thinks he's crazy by now. Know you like Joe, 
but it was sad sad sad that he didn't let me do my job. Was it an intentional con? Very few things he said were 
the truth (but, hey, people liked Bernie Madoff too).... 
Anyway — the past. I'm charging in the range of $1000 — 1500 per day plus expenses and it's all highly 
confidential. A customized 'mind-body' enhancement to achieve the most out of one's life! And, training for 
the family to help transition to the 'new reality' with their loved one with later stage dementia. 
I'm in NYC Friday for the annual meeting of the Circumnavigator's Club, and will stay over the 
weekend. Love to see you if you're in town! Would also like to have lunch with Fred - enjoyed his company - 
but Joe probably won't let that happen CD . 
Love you! And wishing you Love and Happiness, Gwendolyn
