Hi Jeffrey, 
I saw Tom McMillen last night and he asked about you - said he lost touch. He's tight with the Obama's and is going to be 
an Ambassador - apparently any country he wants. So great! I'd LOVE to be an Ambassador and am going attempt to 
raise enough money on the next election cycle. 
His info is: 
and I hesitate to give him your info w/out ur permission... 
Am doing Aspen Institute Socrates Society program over President's weekend if you're in Aspen! Miss you! 
Love and Happiness, Gwendolyn 
PS. Have a conference call with Jessica Joffe tomorrow.
