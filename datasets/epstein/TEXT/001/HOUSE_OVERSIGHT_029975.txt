Subject: are they still bothering you/ if so what about 
From: jeffrey E. <jeevacation©grnail.corn> 
To: 
I have to hand it to ms I'm sure she deserves the pretty penny she has made for her effort. She has 
certainly caught the imagination of a public hungry for salacious fiction. To suggest her story is anything other 
than that, a fiction , is ludicrous. Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy 
to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid 
thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ). being 
lent out to a prime minister though this prime mininster, never out of sight of his massive security detail also 
never visited the island„ sex on a small airplane with a famous lawyer while the other passengers must have 
been all looking out the window during the event . I would have thought that her fabrications were readilly 
apparent , but now , being asked to deny what the press has termed her" allegations " is frankly silly. ok, to 
play along I deny each and every allegation. The only person she didn't suggest she was forced to have sex 
with , was Bilbo Baggins. , maybe its in the sequel.
