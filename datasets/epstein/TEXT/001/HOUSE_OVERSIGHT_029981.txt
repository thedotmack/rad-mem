Hi! Last night we confirmed a studio recording with an stunning soprano to record a new aria Fred wrote. Its 
early 7:30-9pm on April 4. F really wants to see you, so is after that too late? Wanna join us somewhere to eat 
after? Wanna come to the studio? Fred will be playing the piano for the demo. Otherwise, we could have a 
visit anytime you want after the 4th. But if you can, the studio would be fun and I would love to have your 
input in the booth:). Tora and Miasha might come too. Its an awesome aria sung by a Vampiress who looks 
just like (better) Vanessa Williams from our day. ( The Miss USA that somehow had some haha nudie photos 
floating around). ANYWAY. .what do ya think?
