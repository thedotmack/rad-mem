We are sitting in the Amsterdam airport about to take off for Nair. Headed to Cottar's Camp in the Masai Mara....got Mattie in 
tow... she is dressed as a runaway in ripped jeans and a hoodie and sits on the floor of every airport repacking her knapsack. She is 
now passed out, like the homeless. Will take photos and send. 
We are going to photograph ourselves with the Masai in the mud huts and say we crashed the winter White house and are posing 
with Obama's relatives. Miss you. Keep you posted. 
Did you see Sarah, the D on tv or speak to her?
