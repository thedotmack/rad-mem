» Hi Paul. I've been spending lots of time with Irwin Corey and his family past two weeks especially. 
He was in hospital until the last week and then He died a few hours ago peacefully at home in bed. Last 
night he told me Trump will be assassinated soon. He was eager to learn the news each day. I asked him 
if he would join the anti Trump rallies when he gains strength. Doctors thought he might live many 
months. Alas he was laughing and smiling till the end and frowning about Trump. 
» Warm and loving regards

» My friend Alana, a young comedian, was here with him most nights. Irwin used to say he will live to 
147. Alana explained that 102 is 147 in comedian years.
