>> Hi Paul. I've been spending lots of time with Irwin Corey and his family past two weeks especially. He 
was in hospital until the last week and then He died a few hours ago peacefully at home in bed. Last night he 
told me Trump will be assassinated soon. He was eager to learn the news each day. I asked him if he would 
join the anti Trump rallies when he gains strength. Doctors thought he might live many months. Alas he was 
laughing and smiling till the end and frowning about Trump.

>> My friend Alana, a young comedian, was here with him most nights. Irwin used to say he will live to 147. 
Alana explained that 102 is 147 in comedian years.
