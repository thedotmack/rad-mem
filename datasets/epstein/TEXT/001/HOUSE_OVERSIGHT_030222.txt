Please see below. My take:A) voluntary rules are meaningless in terms of arranging for a cessation of crap 
articles/stories etcB) doesn't offer redress (financial or in terms of publicity.Law here definitely provides more 
protection and redress if individual(s) involved in approaches from newspapers are employees or have any 
form of contractual relationship with target.Let's talk.Kevinx

Maz is the most devious and cunning of the bunch. However, Editors can pay for people, stories and documents. 
They can even pay criminals if it is in the public interest. 
Maz can pay who he wants for info but the Yorkshire Ripper for instance, as a convicted criminal, can't sell his 
story...unless in public interest cos there was say, a bent detective.

Witness payments in criminal trials 
i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness - or any person who 
may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness - should be made 
in any case once proceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of 
Court Act 1981. 
This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed 
unconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings 
are otherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; 
or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its 
verdict. 
*ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely and 
foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030222 
may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the 
information concerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public 
interest and there is an over-riding need to make or promise payment 
for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken to 
ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses 
give. In no circumstances should such payment be conditional on the 
outcome of a trial. 
*iii) Any payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to 
give evidence in proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and 
defence. The witness must be advised of this requirement. 
16 
*Payment to criminals 
i) Payment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, 
which seek to exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise 
crime in general, must not be made directly or via agents to convicted 
or confessed criminals or to their associates — who may include 
family, friends and colleagues. 
ii) Editors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers 
would need to demonstrate that there was good reason to believe the 
public interest would be served. If, despite payment, no public 
interest emerged, then the material should not be published.

Actually school means university in the states. I think probably best not to get into the legality or not of 
sexual activity of young people and nor is it relevant to JE case as he was in his late 40's at the time of 
this story. .the headline is deliberately wrong. .school adults would have been accurate..

We should think about a letter to the editor today. 'School' can mean university. Age of 
consent in Florida is complex — see below: 
If you are 16-yrs-old, a sexual relationship with someone 18-24is legal in Florida. The two persons 
involved must be between 16 and 24. 
Florida Statute 794.05 
(1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17  
years of age commits a felony of the second degree.  
So as soon as you turn 16 you are able to have sexual relations. And you can have sexual relations 
with a minor (under 18) until your 24th birthday.  
'Females for JE': Disturbing 
log of telephone calls from 
schoolchildren found in sex 
den of Duke's billionaire 
friend

Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail 
uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the 
58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named 
in several messages. 
Disturbing: Messages were found in Florida home of Jeffrey Epstein, left. The billionaire, 58, is a 
friend of Prince Andrew, right 
In one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night 
for the massage'. 
Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: 'She has 
females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. 
Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030224 
good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, "I love Jeffrey")'. 
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including 
the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David 
Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were 
'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. 
The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein 
and seen yesterday by the Mail.

Logs: Two of the answer phone messages. Miss Maxwell is asked, right, when a girl should give a 
massage 
One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' 
It was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to 
Epstein's abuse. 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 45 min. 
Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are 
included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. 
A man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.' 
Today, Prince Andrew was embroiled in further controversy as it was revealed Kazakhstan had 
asked for his help in recruiting investors to the country. 
The plea came after the former Soviet Republic's President's son-in-law had bought the Prince's 
former marital home for £3million above the asking price. 
Timur Kulibayev paid £15million for Sunninghill Park but it has remained empty and has been 
allowed to fall into disrepair. 
Last year the Prince told Hello! magazine: 'It was like any property deal between friends.' 
Yesterday he attempted to perform business as usual as he visited an East London school and met 
rail bosses in Canary Wharf 
He steadfastly ignored questions from journalists asking whether he was an 'embarrassment to his 
country' and would resign from his trade ambassador role as he arrived for a briefing from 
business executives at the headquarters of the £15billion train project Crossrail. 
Prince Andrew managed to sell Sunninghill Park for £3million more than the asking price

Dear Ghislaine 
Thank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is, 
understandably, a testing time. 
To confirm: 
1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role definition. 
2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie 
Sheen/Rob Lowe and seems to have moved on - for the moment. 
3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and 
follow up with calls to those journalists who have written pieces. 
We will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw. Please don't 
hesitate to call if you have any additional concerns. 
Best regards
