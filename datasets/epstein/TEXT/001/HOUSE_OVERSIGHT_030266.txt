Lawyer Alan Dershowitz has said that he still represents 
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty to 
soliciting underage sexual partners whom he initially 
recruited as masseurs. Dershowitz, 80, told Axios that 
Epstein "has called me a couple of times about legal issues, 
because I'm still technically his lawyer," adding, "I haven't 
had any social, or any other kind of contact [but] you never 
stop being a person's lawyer." Dershowitz told Axios that 
Epstein lent his family his Palm Beach, Florida, house and 
that he received a "therapeutic massage with an old old 
Russian" there, but he'd had no idea "anything improper had 
even taken place in that house." While he was allegedly 
raping teenage girls, Epstein cultivated relationships with a 
global elite: Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane, nicknamed 
the "Lolita Express," numerous times; Prince Andrew's ex-

wife borrowed money from him; and Donald Trump praised 
him as a "terrific guy."
