Other stuff I am sympathetic -- but to answer a random gmail email, that is not smart! 
How are you Trump contacts responding to Comey?

The subject of the email should have been warning enough for Jes Staley, the embattled 
chief executive of Barclays. At quarter to nine on Wednesday evening, after a bruising 
shareholders' meeting, Mr Staley received a message purporting to be from his chairman, 
John McFarlane. The heading read: "The fool doth think he is wise". 
In fact, the message was from a prankster, using the Gmail account 
john.mcfarlane.barclays@gmail.com. The imposter described Michael Mason-Mahon, an 
individual shareholder who called for Mr Staley to resign at Wednesday's annual meeting, 
"as brusque as he is ill informed" and went on to reassure the Barclays chief executive that 
together they had successfully seen off any attempt to force Mr Staley out.

"Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends," the short 
email concluded. "You owe me a large Scotch." 
Mr Staley, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whist] ebl ower, 
soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his 
chairman, who has been dubbed "Mack the Knife" for his habit of ousting chief executives, 
Mr Staley said, "You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane". 
"You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank 
you?" Mr Staley wrote. The 60-year-old Barclays boss continued in the same style: "You 
have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit. 
Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect 
for your guile." 
He had time for yet more praise before he signed off. "And some day I want to see an ad lib 
guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton," said Mr Staley, referencing the 
legendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman's fondness for playing his guitar in 
public meetings. 
The brief conversation ended with a final email around iipm. The imposter sent a poem, 
which began "Worry not of tomorrow's end" and ended "Revel in their bloodied eyes". The 
first letter of each line spelled out the word `Whistleblower'. 
"Thanks for sharing the foxhole," Mr Staley replied. 
The prankster, who contacted the Financial Times via Twitter, told us the email was part 
of his "battle with Barclays" over a customer issue. "I thought I'd see how Jes was relaxing 
after his AGM," he said. 
Barclays declined to comment. 
The emails, which the FT has verified are genuine, are reproduced below.

However I do feel we've ceased the rally for you [sic] head today. 
Surely the fickleminded nature of the angry few will help tie up any loose ends. 
You owe me a large Scotch.

What else would Mack the Knife do but support those he can trust in! 
Begs the question, who should we seek to silence next!? 
Onward, to bigger, and better things. 
I may have already had a stiff one, it's been a long day, and I get no younger.

As I retire for the night, I'm reminded of a poem my father was awfully fond of. It seems 
very apt. 
Good night, Jes. 
Worry not of tomorrow's end 
Hurry not towards falling trees 
Ignore at once, the jesters dance 
Sigh, oh sigh, at the folly foiled 
Take down the mighty route of ills 
Lest not make a scratch in time 
Evenhanded wins fair stance. 
Broken wooden spoons we take 
Left, oh left, in such a state

Over crests and furrowed field 
Wirey talons arching back 
Empty roosts the plagued aspise 
Revel in their bloodied eyes 
We fight on.
