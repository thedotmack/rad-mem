I have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin 
castrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in 
another only given an eileen dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually sent 
emails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be saddled 
with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get it. I tell you 
this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. 
A story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt 
help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I 
tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little 
nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump 
looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for 
your office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of 
unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than 
you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. 
Barry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments 
etc. I will present barry my thoughts on the overall redo , it will be the exact same email that i presented to 
you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil 
funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. 
Tuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are 
filing documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes 
any claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER. ( after youve been told by attnys 
and pwc that you should file in writing , you have NO choice ) .. worst possible result - including 
serious penalties up the kazoo.
