What will the fall-out be from the crisis in the eurozone? Tighter economic coordination or an increasingly detached Germany? We're bringing together a former French president, controversial Conservative MEP Dan Hannan and Timothy Garton Ash to debate the motion "Germany no longer needs Europe – the dream is over <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=4653697a94&e=796428630f> " on May 17th.

Germany no longer needs Europe - the dream is over <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=8113a8af92&e=796428630f>

The Germans have got what they wanted from Europe <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=001b48181e&e=796428630f>  – reunification – and feel increasingly disenchanted with the bargain they had to make to get it – accepting the euro. After the grudging bailout of Greece, the fumbled bailout of Ireland and all the sharp divisions exposed by the financial crisis, isn't the idea of Europe as a world power beginning to look like a pipe dream? Or will the euro crisis drive Europe's leaders to strengthen economic policy coordination to make sure there's no repeat performance, giving a fresh impetus for the dream of Europe? Come and hear what a former French president and five other big hitters have to say on the issue.

The Nobel Prize-winning Trinidadian author V. S. Naipaul <http://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=edb075123f&e=796428630f>  has spent half a century examining the legacy of colonialism on the Third World, unravelling the guilt of the rulers and the self-serving myths of the ruled. His latest book, The Masque of Africa: Glimpses of African Belief, is a travelogue in which the author sets out to discover how far the old Africa's belief in magic has been subverted by the outside world. Tickets are still available to see a giant of Western letters.
