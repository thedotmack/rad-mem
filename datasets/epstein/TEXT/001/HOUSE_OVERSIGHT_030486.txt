Kennedy didn't settle for the generic populist rhetoric of Obama's latest threats to "fight" unspecified bankers 
some indeterminate day. He instead took the strong action of dressing down U.S. Steel by name. As Richard 
Reeves writes in his book "President Kennedy," reporters were left "literally gasping." The young president 
called out big steel for threatening "economic recovery and stability" while Americans risked their lives in 
Southeast Asia. J.F.K. threatened to sic his brother's Justice Department on corporate records and then held 
firm as his opponents likened his flex of muscle to the power grabs of Hitler and Mussolini. (Sound familiar?) 
U.S. Steel capitulated in two days. The Times soon reported on its front page that Kennedy was at "a high point 
in popular support."
