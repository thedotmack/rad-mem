I wouldn't do it. Not yet and not from Davos. As you know, Davos has had some criticism in the press for bank 
CEOs attending and I feel like it's the wrong way to go for your first interview as IB CEO. I also think print has 
much more impact than TV. Talk to Lionel and Robert while you're there -- they are the two guys who can 
move the needle on this. And let's do more in print when you get back. In fact, Matt Zames and I spent an hour 
and a half with WSJ's Kate Kelly from the Journal on this issue for a major story she's doing on the Obama 
proposal. Let's have you quoted in that.
