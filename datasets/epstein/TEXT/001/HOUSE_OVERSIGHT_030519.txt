Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily 
Mail uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. 
Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages 
for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex 
offences. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is 
named in several messages. 
In one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come 
this night for the massage'. Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, 
contain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him'. 
Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just 
did a good one — 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, "I love Jeffrey")'. 
The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends 
including the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and 
magician David Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of 
which were 'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. 
The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into 
Epstein and seen yesterday by the Mail.

Message from a child asking what time to leave school 
---n-----e-__ 
Miss Maxwell is asked when a girl should give a massage 
One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in 
school.' 
It was left in February 2005 — the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted 
police to Epstein's abuse. 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class — will be out in 
45 mm.' 
Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers 
are included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about 
Epstein. 
A man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.'
