To: Jes Staley <_________________________________>; 
mary's great ,thanks.. I will call her again today. my suggestion for T is out of the box ( how unusual ).. 1. I 
still think that the only really qualified person is Jamie. knowledge of system, ddreivatives. banking operations 
both domestic and intl. . Personality issues are the key. ..AS that seems diofficult 2 I THink it would 
behoove Obama to make Bill CLinton Treasury sec.. and move Hillary out. of state. , Bill will be able to 
explain to the public and he world complex issues.. Unlike Jamie he could not craft them, but in todays internet 
world the message and how itis delivered is as important..
