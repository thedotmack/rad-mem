	Dear Ghislaine 
	
	Below is a link to today's Mail.
	
	The allegations are getting worse - this is not a storm you can ride by not making any statement out and get your life back. You have friends saying they don't believe you would act in this way and you need to say that you did not. 
	
	The Mail website is read by 193 million I don't see how a statement denying the allegations will make matters worse which is the acid test. It will make your position better as you will a strong open denial on record. These allegations must not gain traction.
	
	I wont say anymore as I have given my advice - call me.
	
	Best
	
	Philip
