Jeffrey Epstein, the Florida money manager who once roamed in the same social circle as Bill Clinton, Prince 
Andrew and other high profile figures, is going to be released from prison early, a source tells 
RadarOnline.com. 
Epstein pleaded guilty last year to procuring teen girls for prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich and 
famous in a Palm Beach, Florida scandal that reverberated through high-profile society. He received an 18-
month sentence and was slated to be incarcerated until the end of this year. 
But now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing open because Epstein has been secretly helping the feds 
unravel a suspected Ponzi scheme. He had inside knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its victims, 
losing $67 million. 
The source says it's all tied to the indictment of former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and 
in that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as Victim # 1. 
Meanwhile, Epstein's life behind bars hasn't been too rough — in fact he's allowed to spend most days at his 
attorney's office. He was supposedly working on a charity venture but the source says he was actually busy 
helping the feds with the Ponzi scheme. One source says that he's been guarded by men in suits with 
earphones. 
Well if those suits are going to follow him when he's freed they better pack bathing suits. Epstein owns Little St. 
James Island in the Virgin Islands.

HELP ; a reporter for the ny times wants to write the following; Epsteins lawyers were contacted and they said they had no comment.. We 
have checked with some of the worlds financial experts ,both in and out of govt , the consensus is that if Epstein is cooperating with the 
feds the average intelligence of the u.s. government , just went up dramatically.
