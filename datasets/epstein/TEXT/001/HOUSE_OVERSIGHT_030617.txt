Camp Hits Carried Interest in Tax Plan With Wall Street in Focus 
Posted February 25, 2014, 10:29 P.M. ET 
The top Republican tax writer in Congress will lean on the financial industry with his planned revamp of the U.S. code, 
changing the treatment of carried interest and imposing a levy on the assets of banks and insurers. 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) is to unveil the proposed tax code changes Feb. 
26 that also include revisions that affect how investment fund managers' compensation is taxed. He offered a preview 
tonight using rhetoric that in part echoes President Barack Obama's own calls to change tax laws.
