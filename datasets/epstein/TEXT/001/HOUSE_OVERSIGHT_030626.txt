Marty, 
Please find attached of the motion papers we just filed to unseal the redacted briefs in the 2011 appeal we 
discussed yesterday. As per my client's instructions, we have set the return date on the motion as December 
31. If Mr. Epstein has no opposition to the motion, however, no opposition or response is necessary. 
Best regards and happy holidays,
