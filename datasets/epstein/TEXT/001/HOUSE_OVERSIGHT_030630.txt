Hi Jeffrey ! 
Here is a short video of me sailing under Golden Gate Bridge with my Stanford friends. Really rett : 
can't express how happy I am to be here. Totally over the moon every day going to 
and exploring the area. 
Now I'm on the way to Tuscon to visit whose info I sent you for assistant r,osition. She 
would love to pass interviews with you. She is smart and easy, her mum produced movie so 
knows a lot in film industry too besides other assets. 
What happens with zubair's project ? Do you believe it can be used in H.clinton's campaign or the Trump's 
one to help her/ him win elections ? His goal is to propose it to them to find out in which states, what 
kind of people should be targeted to collect votes. He says that his algorithms can figure reasons why a 
category of people vote against a candidate and to help candidate to adapt the campaign to the people's 
preferences...well, to win elections at the end!
