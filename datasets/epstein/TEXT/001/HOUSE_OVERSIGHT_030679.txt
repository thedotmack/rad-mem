Hi Jeffery — 
I just wanted to follow up on a couple of notes. I have been coordinating with Richard Kahn (copied), and I have sent 
along to him the invoice and donation letter. So, we are all set on that front. 
I also wanted to circle back around on Peggy's note below. Will you indeed be attending the ceremony this year? Also, 
you had indicated you would have three additional guests as well. If you are available to attend the ceremony, please 
let us know, as well as to provide us with the names of your three guests. (Security is extra tight this year, with 
honoring Al Gore and all, and everyone's names have to be on the list to attend). 
Thanks so much, and look forward hearing more on this. 
Best, 
Steven

Hello Jeffrey — 
I hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards 
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. 
This year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive 
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The 
Director Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the 
Industry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more

pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year 
ranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Bilge, this 
year's ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Best regards, 
Steven
