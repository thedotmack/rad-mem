Looks like I can't get away. But will be back in NYC on Sunday. Let me know when you're back too. I have a 
bad feeling about this new Woody round. It could pull him into the general Harvey pool of the despised and 
shunned. Clearly what Ronan and company are hoping for. I think Bannon may be right. This is not going to 
end until Trump goes down.
