All good. I am everybody's darling. Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite unpopular. 
Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 Minutes 
producer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: "You own me a few million." Rosen also 
says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with Trump. I can't get 
together today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-signing 
800 books). Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill Maher show. Making money is hard work.
