Bannon's "nationalist-populist" platform is coherent, rational, and, apparently appealing to a great many people. 
I can't see why at this point he wouldn't want to use his world-stage stature to make an argument for it and to 
claim leadership of it. What does he have to lose? What else is there, except to suck up to Trump, and get the 
chance to be manhandled by him again?

All good. I am everybody's darling. Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite unpopular. 
Apparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 Minutes 
producer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: "You own me a few million." Rosen also 
says he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with Trump. I can't get 
together today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-
signing 800 books). Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill Maher show. Making money is hard work.
