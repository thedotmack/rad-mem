Subject: A few thoughts 
Importance: High 
1) I saw SB in London yesterday and he seemed especially paranoid about any reporters seeing me with him. 
My guess is that he is working hard on his relationship with Trump who he sees as newly ascendent and being 
seen with me might queer that. 
2) He went on Hannity last night and will be on Piers Morgan tomorrow and that seemed with an eye toward an 
audience of one. 
3) He was having a meeting yesterday with the French right wingers, including Le Pen's husband, about 
refinancing the National Front Party because apparently a good part of their money comes from Russia. Two 
thoughts here, these guys seemed like idiots, pure Ruritania, and Bannon, surrounded by his own thuggish-
looking security people and whacky-bloggers advisors, thrives precisely because the world of populism is so 
unprofessional (if not farcical).
