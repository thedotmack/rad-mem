Subject: more to follow 
Pg 5 first par — reporter speaks about a "sex slave ring" and speaks in the plural "sex slaves" suggesting more 
than one accusation 
Pg 8 1st par — reporter should clarify that the young women at your house (and later on your plane) are 
comely but clearly not underage 
Pg 20- might lead a reader to think you helped clients hide wealth raises flags) 
Pg 21 — Hoffenberg mentioned — I assume from what everyone including J Sweet says he is nuts but not 
flattering and totally irrelevant to the story 
Pg 25 — quoting you on massages — your adversaries will exploit this to show a lack of remorse, minimizing 
the conduct etc - 
Pg 25-26 — don't help him with SG — he's confusing SG and HR — whatever SGs age her website said she was 
18 
Pg 26 — he loops back to your "description" which opens reporter up to tough depoto 
Pg 28 — your quotes re NPA being Kafkaesque.....can be exploited to harm you 
Pg 30 — he writes about VR — "new chapter" — sounds like he is quoting you — he can preface it with 
"according to court papers..." and not suggest you are narrating the description of the VR allegations 
Pg 31 — he writes that you said this "this is all utterly false" re VR allegations should limit denial to Clinton, 
Gore 
Pg 31 — he writes that VR is now suing you for 50M not true case over. 
Pg 31-2 — close to end where he says in essence the only thing you regret is not being more circumspect re 
legal advice — not wise ,
