While Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump have yet to repair their rift, the president's moves against China represent a 
policy victory for his excommunicated aide. During his final weeks in the White House, Mr. Bannon kept a 
whiteboard in his office, on which he had scrawled a calendar for trade actions against China, the European 
Union and others.
