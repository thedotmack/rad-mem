In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section — which examines possible 
political and government corruption — have sought documents related to Broidy's business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of and interactions 
with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the former RNC finance 
chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and communications related to Broidy. 
An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is cooperating with the 
Justice Department. 
"Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason to believe that 
anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in," Weingarten said in a statement.
