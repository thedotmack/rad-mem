All eyes on Iran talks today which were extended by a day into Wednesday. Earlier in the day, a US official suggested 
that negotiation may continue another day past deadline if 'it's useful to do so'. Another Russian official commented 
that a deal was 'closer and closer'. This optimism about an agreement, at least on some points, weighed heavily on oil 
today with Brent dropping 2.5%. In my opinion, even if the talks end positively with agreement on key points, the deal 
has been softened enough compared to what was originally sought by President Obama, and is going to face a tough 
challenge being approved by a skeptical Congress, which is in fact proposing to impose new sanctions on Iran. 
Nigeria's elections ended today easing the political tension, with the ex-military ruler Buhari's winning against the 
incumbent President. In short term, this eased any immediate violence concerns in the country, but this shift in power 
can lead to the movement of the Boko Haram violence to southern oil producing region of Nigeria and any 
developments there need to be carefully watched. In other news, Yemen rebels seized military base at Bab el-Mandeb, 
overlooking the key shipping route while Saudi-led coalition kept bombing Houthi occupied sites.. 
Vols were stronger with wings being bought aggressively today as oil can move quickly away from current levels 
depending on Iran deal outcome.. overall vols gained about 1% across the curve

The base complex traded down in the morning then picked up on improving customer confidence only to crash off again 
at close. China has reduced the deposits required from home buyers for the second time in 6 months in an attempt to 
boost sliding house prices, which should have knock on effects in the copper and nickel markets. Nickel continues its 
slide as CTA funds have sold off heavily on the supply crunch failing to materialize and demand from the stainless steel 
market evaporating. Nickel ore supplies are also returning from the Philippines as the rainy season ends, adding further 
supply pressure. Chinese NPI producers are cutting production, selling stocks or attempting to secure loans on the back 
of stocks in warehouses. Rio Tinto have resolved the their tax dispute with the Mongolian government over the Oyu
