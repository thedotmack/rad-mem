Steve Bannon almost appeared in Michael 
Moore's 'Fahrenheit 11/9' 
Steve Bannon was invited to be in Michael Moore's latest documentary, "Fahrenheit 11/9," 
and while the former White House strategist declined to go on camera, he did meet with 
Moore for two hours, the filmmaker revealed after the film's NYC premiere. 
After a Lincoln Center screening, Moore, at a Tavern on the Green party, revealed Bannon 
was almost in the film. "We wanted Steve Bannon to answer that first question in the film: 
'How the f—k did this happen?' " the liberal gadfly told guests. 
"It took a long time. We finally got him to come over, no cameras ... He said he wanted to 
talk to me first. And we talked to him for two hours." 
Ultimately, Bannon decided not to go on camera, but the conversation had a seismic impact 
on the finished film anyway. 
"He said something very profound to us, and it changed us and it changed the course of the 
film," Moore said of Bannon. "I asked him, 'How did you pull this [Trump's election] 
off?' And he said, 'It's a very easy answer. Our side, we go for the head wound. Your side, 
you have pillow fights.'" 
Moore continued, "That so f—ked us up to hear him say that ... watching him smirk as he 
said it. As soon as he left, we decided to watch the film... and put the pillow fight filter." 
One example Moore gave of a change to his film post-Bannon was a line about news 
networks being run by men, from "most" to "all." 
"It's amazing how we talk as liberals. We always want to be nice and maybe be fair," Moore 
explained. 
The film also jabs at the media, highlighting major newsmen who have turned out to be 
predators, including Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose.

A spy told us, "Everyone in the theater hissed when Les Moonves' face came up on-screen." 
Moore also held a Q&A after the screening. 
The movie's already premiered in Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., and played the 
Toronto International Film Festival.
