Bruno Le Maire criticizes the French PM for failing to present efficient solutions to the crisis in Syria. Instead 
the PM has been merely following the course of Obama, who, according to Bruno, does not know what he 
wants. Such an approach has weakened the influence of France on the international arena and has undermined 
its sovereignty. 
Also watched some other videos of him - Bruno attacks Hollande for his tax policy and excuses him for "not 
knowing what he is doing"..
