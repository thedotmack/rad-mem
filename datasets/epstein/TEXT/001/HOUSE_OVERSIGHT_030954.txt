Unfortunately, bin Sulayem and I did not meet. I was stuck at the White House and he had a narrow window 
before heading to Cyprus. I just sent him the following note: 
"Good Morning, I hope your travels to Cyprus were smooth. 
Okey Enelamah, Nigeria's trade minister, stopped by my home this evening as he was still in town after Buhari's 
visit with Trump. He mentioned his discussions with you at WEF and afterwards. Separately, I spoke earlier 
with the Vice President. 
Whenever we meet, I have some thoughts that may be helpful to you."

Thank you for the introduction. Do you have a better sense of what he needs? Also, what's his 
WhatsApp/mobile so I can confirm details for today? 
When's best on Friday for me to visit with you? 
Bibi's speech was a bit of a dead letter on Europe.
