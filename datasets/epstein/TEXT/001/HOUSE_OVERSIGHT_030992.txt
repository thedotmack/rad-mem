160 million are retired. 
That leaves 140 million to do the work. 
There are 85 million in school.

Which leaves 55 million to do the work. 
Of this there are 35 million employed by 
the federal government. 
Leaving 20 million to do the work. 
2.8 million are in the armed forces

preoccupied with killing Osama 
Bin-Laden. 
Which leaves 17.2 million to do the work. 
Take from that total the 15..8 million 
people who work for state and city 
Governments. And that leaves 1.4 million 
to do the work. 
At any given time there are 188,000 people 
in hospitals. 
Leaving 1,212,000 to do the work.

Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons. 
That leaves just two people to do the work. 
You and me. 
And there you are, 
Sitting on your chair,

At your computer, reading jokes. 
Nice. Real nice.
