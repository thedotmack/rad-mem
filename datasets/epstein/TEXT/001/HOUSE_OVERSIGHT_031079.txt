ok.. I just sent an additional email which moderates this.. everyone was a victim, including Jeffrey here.. 
and there was no happy resolution.. please add.. "probably everyone was a victim, with no happy resolution 
or consequences of these activities", after "was the victim in this case.".

Okay, thanks for this statement . . . I'll print it in full along with the article, probably today. I very, very 
strongly disagree with your position and hope you eventually reconsider, but I do appreciate you taking the 
time to respond.

jeffrey apparently paid for massages with sex... I believe him when he told me he had no idea the girls were 
underage, and I doubt that people normally are asked for or present a driver's license under such 
circumstances... Moreover, I also believe that Jeffrey is an easy target for those who want to take advantage 
of him... Moreover, I can say with great honesty that Jeffrey's time in prison led him to seriously examine 
his life in very positive ways and I don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for 
something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I 
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with 
Jeffrey that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peopleI 
know and like have behavior I don't entirely approve of. I know it is not politically correct to say that, 
because in general this is a very sensitive issue and all other things being equal one should take the side of 
the young women. But all things are not equal in this case, from my point of view. It is a judgement call, 
and I will not turn my back on a good friend so easily.

Thanks for getting back to me. I was asking because I found the quote shocking . . . the evidence against 
Epstein is overwhelming and he's even pled guilty to paying for sex with a minor. It's in no way scientific or 
rational to assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is 
possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with 
underage girls in his private life. 
I'm going to write about the topic on Skepchick, and I'll include any additional statement you'd like if you 
want to provide more context or if you've changed your mind.

yes it is.. Based on my direct experience with Jeffrey, which is all I can base my assessment on, he is a 
thoughtful, kind, considerate man who is generous to his friends, and all of the women I have known who 
have been associated with Jeffrey speak glowingly in the same words.. 
why are you asking?

Dear Professor Krauss, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031080 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
"If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge," says Krauss. "Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people." Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, "I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it." 
Thanks, 
Rebecca Watson
