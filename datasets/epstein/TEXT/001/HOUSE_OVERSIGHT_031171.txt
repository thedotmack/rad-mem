Justice Department 
opens Epstein probe 
The Associated Press 
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — 
The Justice Department has opened 
an investigation into federal prosecu-
tors' handling of a plea deal in which a 
wealthy, politically connected Virgin 
Islands financier avoided potentially 
severe penalties for sexually abusing 
teenage girls in favor of a relatively 
light state conviction in Florida. 
The depart-
ment's Office 
of Professional 
Responsibility 
wrote in a letter 
Wednesday to 
US. Sen. Ben 
Sasse, R-Nebras-
ka, that it would 
examine whether 
professional mis- Jeffrey Epstein 
conduct occurred in the highly publi-
cized case of Jeffrey Epstein. The let-
ter cited a series of recent articles by 
the Miami Herald that focused new 
attention on how the deal came about. 
Sasse, a member of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee who has twice 
asked the Justice Department to in-
vestigate the case, welcomed the 
news. 
"Jeffrey Epstein is a child rapist 
and there's not a single mom or dad in 
America who shouldn't be horrified 
by the fact that he received a patheti-
cally soft sentence," Sasse said in an 
email. "The victims of Epstein 's child 
sex trafficking ring deserve this inves-
tigation — and so do the American 
people and members of law enforce-
ment who work to put these kinds of 
monsters behind bars." 
Epstein, who also has homes in 
Palm Beach, Fla., and New York, 
lives on Little St. James Island off St. 
Thomas. 
Epstein, now 66, reached a non-
prosecution deal in 2008 with then-
Miami US. Attorney Alexander 
Acosta's office to secretly end a fed-
eral sex abuse investigation involving 
at least 40 teenage girls that could 
have landed him behind bars for life. 
He instead pleaded guilty to state 
charges, spent 13 months in jail, paid 
settlements to victims and is a regis-
tered sex offender. 
Acosta, now President Donald 
Trump's labor secretary, has defend-
ed the deal as appropriate but has not 
commented since the recent round of 
stories. He was asked about the case 
during his Senate confirmation hear-
ings for the Cabinet post. 
Some of his accusers are pursuing 
a separate legal effort to nullify the 
plea agreement.
