New Book Rips Jeffrey Epstein's $50 Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme Text 
Hot Book Rips Jeffrey Epstein's $50 Billion Dollar Ponzi Crime Covered Up By President Obama 
By Steven Hoffenberg 
Publisher/CEO 
Lisa Twardeau died at the dirty hands of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's lies about the crimes he committed while working 
atTowersinvestors.com. 
Jeffrey Epstein looted Towers Investors of billions of dollars in ponzi crimes at the time Lisa became the wife of Steven Hoffenberg, 
who was Epstein's boss at Towers Investors. 
Epstein defrauded the Towers Investors with a cover-up after taking $2 billion from Towers and depositing it into the Epstein Hedge 
Fund Financial Trust Corp. 
Lisa Twardeau died when she was going to expose the fact that Jeffrey Epstein looted billions from Towers Investors by ponzi 
crimes. 
Now, from the grave, Lisa Twardeau slams arrogant ponzi crimes King Epstein in the tell-all book she wrote that reveals everything 
about Epstein and the Feds' cover-up with President Obama. 
The Feds are bad. They are covering up the Epstein ponzi crimes. The Lisa Twardeau book states that the FBI is violating the law 
with this cover-up. 
The book says President Obama told the Attorney General that Jeffrey Epstein was cooperating in an overseas banking crime, but 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031193 
the FBI can't arrest Epstein. These are all lies by the President of the United States. 
The book says that President Obama lied to cover up his relationship with Larry Summers who is on Jeffrey Epstein's payroll. 
The book could give reasons for the president to be impeached for obstruction of justice whereby the U.S. Attorney General will 
learn everything that is in the Twardeau book. 
Readers, stay with this hot story that reveals that a cover-up in America is taking place. 
The Richard Nixon story all over again is in the Lisa Twardeau book coming soon........
