HI BRAD 
PLEASE CONSIDER WISDOM IN THE YEARS OF LITIGATION AGAINST JEFF EPSTEIN . 
1 ST THOMAS HAS THE MAJOR BENEFIT BY THE ATTACHMENT OF ALL THE JEFF EPST 
EIN & CLIENTS ASSETS IN THE EPSTEIN OPERATIONS ON ST THOMAS. 
2 EPSTEIN IS NOW THE COLLECTION PROCEEDING UNDER THE FEDERAL & ST THOMAS 
LAW . 
3 EPSTEIN HAS THE WRONG PERSON AS THE ST THOMAS AGENT FOR EPSTEIN WHEREB 
Y THE EPSTEIN ST THOMAS AGENT IS THE WIFE OF THE FORMER HEAD OF ST THOMA 
S NOT THE PARTY PERSON FROM THE LEADERSHIP IN ST THOMAS. 
4 EPSTEIN BACKED THE PARTY IN ST THOMAS THAT DID NOT WIN THE ST THOMAS RA 
CE. 
5 ST THOMAS NEEDS MONEY THAT THE ATTACHMENT OF THE EPSTEIN ASSETS ON ST 
THOMAS WILL PROVIDE AT ONCE. 
6 BANKS LENDING EPSTEIN & CLIENTS ALL OF THE MONEY FOR TRADING THE MARGI 
N ACCOUNTS MUST PUT EPSTEIN et 
al INTO BANKRUPTCY ONCE ST THOMAS MOVES AGAINST EPSTEIN & ALL OF THE ASSE 
TS ON ST THOMAS THAT EPSTEIN WORKS WITH EVERY DAY.
