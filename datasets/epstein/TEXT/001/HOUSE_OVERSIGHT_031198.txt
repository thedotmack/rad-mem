T
he identity of the woman, who
filed a series Donald Trump rape
cases, has been revealed. It turned
out it was the same woman behind the
different cases filed in different courts
one after the other.
In a May 6 report from showbiz
website Gossip Extra, the woman
behind the rape case against the
presidential-wannabe Donald
Trump, along with the American
financier Jeffrey Epstein, was
identified as Katie Johnson. In the
same report, some highlights were
revealed, including the defendant
and circumstances revolving the
case.
It was also in the same report where
the man who claimed as the
spokesperson for Johnson said that
the plaintiff has been shopping for
lawyers from California, Atlanta,
and Florida to represent her when
they re-file the Donald Trump rape
case in New York. The case, which
was initially filed in California in
April, was junked by the court after
failure of the complainant to prove a
California address.
True enough, a rape case filed
against the same respondents,
Trump and Epstein, with basically
the same facts, reappeared and was
refilled in New York City, like what
Johnson’s spokesperson said last
month.

However, in the newly filed case in
New York City, the respondent was
only identified as Tiffany Doe. In the
case in New York City, the
complainant claimed she was raped
by Trump and Epstein in one of the
parties Epstein hosted, the Real Deal
reported.
She claimed that she was only 13
when she was raped by the duo in
1994. The incident occurred at
Epstein’s Wexner Mansion. In the
document, the complainant added
she was hired by Epstein to recruit
young girls in the guise of a
modeling stint. Trump’s camp
refused to comment as they are yet
to read the complaint, while
Epstein’s representatives were not
available for comment, the Real Deal
added.
