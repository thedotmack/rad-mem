Dear Jeffrey, 
_wrote: 
I am sorry I did not call back Yesterday-I was exhausted from a crazy week and fell asleep 
as soon as I came home! Anyway, here is the full program and attendee list attached, this 
is the Globalization Summit I invited Bill Clinton to when I met him in Stockholm last Summer-
But he is a bit busy I gather! 
Anyway, hope got hold of you re search service? Also, I did see your mail 
about possibly coming here end of September-however, I am supposedly arranging a fund-
raiser for Congress Woman Diana deGette of Colorado on Sept 27 in NYC; she is the only one with a scientific agenda 
and she is just super-if anything I am hoping on your involvement? 
How about going to Stockholm mid or end november..albeit a bit dark and maybe cold..? 
Let me know what you think! 
Also, I just heard from my friend Jeff Kriendler in Miami and guess who was just walking in there -our friend Goldsamt! 
First prize for perseverance! 
Also, Sofia and the prince is on every magazine here, I think it is wonderful! 
Marcus has two big concerts in Stockholm this coming week. Me - SALSS!
