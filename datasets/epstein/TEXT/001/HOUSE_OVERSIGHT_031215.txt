Dear Jeffrey, 
Huge thanks for giving BBB another chance!!We have 200 quite fantastic young women 
including a minister, an ambassador-Lisa! a professor -your Ml-a princess-Sofia! and 
the other 196 
are doing pretty good as well...lots of young girls in Sweden now dream of joining 
BBB...we really build something 
unique and worthwhile!! Young dean at Stockholm School of Economics is an idiot to 
through it all out but 
now its time to develop it smartly! I will be doing a famous Summer radio program in a few 
weeks in Sweden, 
1 million listeners...among other things, I will talk about the girls..(and my blind date long 
ago with a Donald 
Trump.. ha ha!) Anyway, please see details for the money transaction below - Edyta is my 
banker ann a super 
person! - I am leaving tomorrow night if anything? Also, if you send me a cell phone 
number, I can start sending 
you photos from BBB, much easier than e-mail. 
TACK sweetheart for continuing believing in BBB! Kram BE
