Hi Richard - 
I certainly will. But perhaps you can clarify something for me before I put all this together for the donation. 
Jeffrey Epstein had asked to submit the letter and invoice to Peggy Siegal instead, and she had supplied 
different information than below. 
Please advice how best to proceed. 
Best, 
Steven

Hello Jeffrey — 
>, Richard Kahn 
I hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards 
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. 
This year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive 
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The Director 
Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the Industry 
Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more pleased 
to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year ranging 
from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Blige, this year's 
ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Best regards, 
Steven
