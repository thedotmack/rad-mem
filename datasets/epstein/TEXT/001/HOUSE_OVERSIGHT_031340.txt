Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones threatened special counsel Robert Mueller during a Monday episode 
of his InfoWars show, miming a shooting and saying he would "die trying" to take Mueller down. 
Jones began by making unfounded claims about Mueller and Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of 
solicitation of a minor for prostitution in 2008. 
"That's the thing, is like, once it's Mueller, everyone's so scared of Mueller, they'd let Mueller rape 
kids in front of people, which he did," Jones said. "I mean, Mueller covered up for a decade for 
Epstein kidnapping kids, flying them on sex planes, some kids as young as seven years old 
reportedly, with big perverts raping them to frame people."

"That's a demon I will take down, or I'll die trying," Jones continued. 
Jones made repeated shooting gestures as he closed out the rant. 
"It's not a joke. It's not a game. It's the real world. Politically. You're going to get it, or I'm going to die 
trying, b*tch," Jones concluded. "Get ready. We're going to bang heads. We're going to bang heads."
