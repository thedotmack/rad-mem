Well i should have figured it was only a matter of time before some other brilliant lawyer tried to find a way to 
tie you to Trump and see if he could money off it and now i just read exactly that with this guy cheney 
mason. Unbelievable. These guys just love the publicity - clinton, dershowitz, now Trump. First these 
"friends" act like anything but your friend once they get sued; then the next joker of a lawyer decides to join this 
cottage industry of suing you and hoping either you settle or the "friend" settles. 
Sorry to see this. Good luck.

Just read the Fox News piece today rehashing old stories. The media just cannot let go and loves to think of 
new angles to get you in headlines. Sorry to see it; but i am sure by now you can deal with it for what it is. 
I appreciate the call from Darren a few weeks ago and would have loved to have a fought a battle for the fellow 
at issue. But once he let me know the guy had been served and it was just a matter if defending a deposition, i 
suggested that it might be a waste of money to have me handle that. I hope it worked out. I am more than 
happy to get involved any time in any way i can help - and i would like to think i could help with what i bring 
to the table. I just did not feel in that circumstance that you did not need me adding to the milking of resources 
that i am sure has been going on with lawyers for years. 
I would have felt differently if it were a matter if taking depositions or actually litigating a case. I would like 
to think that in that circumstance i could add value. If we ever meet, i will tell you a bit about depositions i 
took not long ago of the leaders of the PFLP terrorist organization. That was my kind of setting. 
Please know that i am here to help in any way i can with any case or just for advice if you think my help would 
be meaningful. Your situation seems to me to raise the combination of friends you have been very good to 
using all you gave them and then ditching you and sharks swarming when they smell blood and i don't like to 
see either. 
I "met" you originally through a friend i like very much. I wish it had been earlier in time; but looking to the 
present and future, you just let me know if you need me. 
Take care.

and I hope that is the case and all works out well as soon as possible.

That's a pretty clear answer. Thanks, you saved me a phone call. If you have any other ideas for top guys there, let 
me know. Otherwise, I have a former FBI guy I might use. Going to be a very hard fought case. Take care, David

You might recall that we "met" by email and on the phone a couple of years ago, originally through our mutual friend 
Bernard Kruger. 
I have a question for you. I am preparing a lawsuit against the Broward County Sheriff's Department. I am looking for 
a good and trustworthy private investigator there who will not undercut me with the Sheriff's department because of 
ties there, etc. I have a couple of candidates; but someone recently referred me to one in Davie, FL who this person 
said would fit the bill. 
When I went on the guy's website, however, I see that one of the things he apparently holds out as a highlight (it is on 
his "press" page) is a series of stories about your case. I assume the guy was an investigator for the other side in the 
civil case - the group that set you up. 
His name is Mike Fisten and his company is Blueline Investigations. If he is someone who you encountered and he 
was a bad guy or out to get you, I would not want to use him. Even though we don't really know each other, I very 
much liked you when we spoke and I would not want to give business to someone who had gone after you and you 
think is a bad guy. If on the other hand, he was a decent guy just doing his job, perhaps it would be ok. I can't tell 
enough about it from his website.

Any thoughts on the guy? 
Meanwhile, I hope all is going well for you now and I wish you a happy and healthy new year.

As terrible as the system is and has been to you, I have to tell you one encouraging thing. Last Friday I spoke on a 
panel in DC on the justice system. I was seated next to Justice Breyer and got to know him a bit. For what it is 
worth, he certainly seem to understand that the system is broken and I hear this more and more. Indeed, he made it 
very clear that he thinks the sentencing system (which he helped form as a member of the Sentencing Commission) 
is broken and while you are past having to deal with that, I would like to think this raises some hope that the rest of 
the system will improve if others in his position feel the same. 
Tomorrow I go to Alabama to argue before the court of appeals regarding the constitutionality of Alabama's 
Community Notification Act, which the lower court struck down as unconstitutional already. Ultra right wing court 
and election year, so who knows; but these laws are so Draconian. 
I saw that the U.S. Attorney's office is appearing in your civil cases as well. Some strange folks in that 
office. Anyway, I will look forward to talking and while all the judges are going to be tough, Judges Marra and 
Johnson so far have not been rubber stamps for government in my case and that means something.
