Out of 13 states we got 11 right. The ones we got wrong are NY and WI. 
In the last report, analyzed data was of 3 days in which Clinton got a positive spike after she got clearance 
from FBI. However Trump dominated the social media positively if we analyze one week data before starting 
time of election, monthly data and entire data which we have gathered for months. Based on this we predicted 
on our Facebook page on 30th October that Trump will be next president of US. 
Our model works but I think the important question which we failed to answer is that how much historic data 
must be analyzed to make the right decision. This could have been answered if we had a Data Scientist. Also I 
believe its a great tool to track voters and get them to vote. It can be used in French elections next year or 
elections of Brazil in 2018 but unfortunately I have to shut down this project as getting data from Twitter is 
expensive and the start up is running out of money. 
I am going to focus on cyber security again and will definitely reach out if I have a powerful investable idea.
