They claimed they had 1500 hits for their announcement about me and buzzfeed, which doesn't seem like a lot, 
but they thought so, and they are getting pressure from various of their supporters and senior people.. this 
three week thing may be true, but I wonder if I will ever really recover.. I wish they would indict Trump or 
something right now..

I had my call with the Bulletin, I am going to take a voluntary leave as Chair of the Board.. allowing me and them to make nice 
statements about me and how the board appreciates me, has never had a complaint, how professional I am, and how they hope I will 
return after this has subsided.. The alternative was worse.
