Now everyone coming to me thinking I have juicy info on you and Trump. 
Because of this. 
"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is 
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it --
Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
That story will never die.
