Federal prosecutors are investigating whether U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural 
committee misspent some of the funds it raised, the Wall Street Journal reported on 
Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The probe opened by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is examining whether some of the 
committee's donors gave money in exchange for policy concessions, influencing 
administration positions or access to the incoming administration, the Journal said.
