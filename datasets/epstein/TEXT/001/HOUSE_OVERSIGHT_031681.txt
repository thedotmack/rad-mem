"That Russian oligarch who spent that money on that property and never moved into it and ultimately tore it 
down, he's also a large shareholder in a bank called the Bank of Cyprus, which has been implicated in Russian 
money laundering. The chairman of the Bank of Cyprus is the former CEO of Deutsche Bank, to which Donald 
Trump owed all that money at the time he conveniently got this very large influx of cash from a Russian guy. 
The vice chairman of that bank until recently was our new secretary of commerce, long time Trump friend, 
Wilbur Ross.
