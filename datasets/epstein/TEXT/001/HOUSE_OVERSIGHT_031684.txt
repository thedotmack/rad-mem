Subject: Re: 
Salvator Mundi, the last known da Vinci painting in private hands, has an incredible 
provenance. Rybolovlev purchased it for $127 million in 2013 through his art dealer, the 
Swiss businessman Yves Bouvier. Bouvier, the owner and operator of several freeports, 
bought the painting for $80 million with the intention of selling it to Rybolovlev at a steep 
profit. Its owner before Bouvier, the New York City-based gallerist Robert Simon, found 
the painting at an estate auction in New Orleans in 2005. He paid just $10,000.
