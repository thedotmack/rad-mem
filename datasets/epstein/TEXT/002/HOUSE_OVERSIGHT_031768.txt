0 Photo by Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images Stormy Daniels hit back with an insult of her own after President 
Trump called her "Horseface." President Trump on Tuesday called adult-film star Stormy Daniels "Horseface" 
and threatened to "go after" her after he won a court victory over his alleged mistress.

"Federal Judge throws out Stormy DaniaIs [sic] lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees.' 
@FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will 
confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con!' he tweeted. 
The tweet comes one day after a federal judge in California threw out Daniels's defamation lawsuit against 
Trump and ordered Daniels to repay the president's legal fees. 
Daniels's attorney, Michael Avenatti, responded by calling Trump a "disgusting misogynist" and a "liar" who 
has dishonored his family and country. 
"You are a disgusting misogynist and an embarrassment to the United States. Bring everything you have, 
because we are going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shyster and liar you are. How many other 
women did you cheat on your wife with while you had a baby at home?" he tweeted.
