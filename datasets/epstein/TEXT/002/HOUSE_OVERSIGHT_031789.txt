Trump advisors reportedly seeking a 
pardon for 'junk bond king' Milken 
Tae Kim 
%taws. 
Several of President Donald Trump's advisors are pushing him to pardon Michael Milken, 
Bloomberg News reported Friday. 
Michael Milken, 71, was known as the "junk bond king" in the 1980s and was convicted for 
securities fraud.

Bloomberg said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, senior advisor Jared Kushner and attorney Rudy  
Giuliani support the pardon for Milken. 
Milken has a net worth of $3.7 billion, according to Forbes. The financier, who pioneered 
the market for high-yield bonds while at Drexel Burnham Lambert, was sentenced to 10 
years in prison and permanently banned from the securities industry by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. His prison term was reduced to two years. 
The White House and a spokesperson for the Milken Institute did not immediately respond 
to requests for comment.
