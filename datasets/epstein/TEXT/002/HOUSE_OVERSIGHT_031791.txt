Also, can u let me know if Wexner and Maxwell were actually personally served or if it was just someone at the location 
eligible to accept.

Thank you for the email, however, in briefly reviewing LM's responses, she mentions a Dr. Rishard. I have previously 
asked your office to provide Dr. Rishard's contact information. I have looked for an "Office of Palm Beach Doctors" and 
and a "Dr. Rishard" and have been unable to locate either. Please provide me with contact information so that I may 
obtain records. Thank you.
