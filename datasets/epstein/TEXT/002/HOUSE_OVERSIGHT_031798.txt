They try to keep this story going from every angle. Now dershowitz isn't involved; rather he is a high powered 
lawyer. I didn't know you also had lefkowitz. I met the guy once when a prospective client asked me to try a 
case with him. One meeting was enough for me to see clearly that that would not have worked out well; but he 
apparemtly is a successful lawyer. 
One thing for sure the article gets wrong - that the "victims" were silenced. 
Hope you are doing well.
