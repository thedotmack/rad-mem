The allegation: Harth claimed that Trump made repeated unwanted sexual advances as she and her romantic 
partner at the time, George Houraney, pursued a business relationship with the mogul in the early 1990s. She 
said that on January 24, 1993, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump offered her a tour of the estate, then pulled her into his 
daughter Ivanka's empty bedroom. 
"He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again," Harth 
said, "and I had to physically say: 'What are you doing? Stop it.' It was a shocking thing to have him do this 
because he knew I was with George, he knew they were in the next room. And how could he be doing this when 
I'm there for business?" 
In 1997 Harth and Houraney sued Trump for breach of contract, and she filed a separate sexual-harassment suit, 
accusing him of "attempted rape." They reached a confidential settlement in the contract suit, and as part of the 
agreement Harth withdrew her suit.
