My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The stock is now 
down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So I think it 
makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity from 
management.

I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas which I will 
send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of 
focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from 
management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts. 
However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry.

decided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. ? knowing full well that time

dip fof 25%. wanting to buy the highter strike, is ok. but why the same month? why the same moment. why the 
same index. . sorry. I have taught this for many years. and your grade is an F. not one good move in 
many. . re broadcom. the crack happend in the morning, options were higher. no alternative presented. no 
analysis. , this is no way to manage money. I have lost a great deal of money hoping you would be able to do as you 
promised you could . would.. Had you told me, jeffrey I d like to try a new job as a manager lets start slow I can 
learn. i would be less annoyed. you told me you had great confidence knew the risks and truly believed you would 
be able to raise money .do well and prosper. . If it were not you, this would have ended months ago.. we should 
work on a solution . not sure yet what shape it takes.
