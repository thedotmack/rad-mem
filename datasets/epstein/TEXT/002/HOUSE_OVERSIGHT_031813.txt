My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The 
stock is now down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding 
mergers. So I think it makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we 
hopefully get more clarity from management.

I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas 
which I will send you over the weekend if that is OK. 
Re Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been 
a lot of focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we 
hear from management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. 
This morning the pricing is as follows: 
Aug 200 Puts cost $4.10 
Sept 200 Puts cost $7.90 
Earning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept 
puts. However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management 
before August expiry.

Im not angry, sorry, it is sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a 
mistake. . the spy trades were the results of a rank amatuer. . you took a postion on the direction of the 
market. ok. you decided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. 
? knowing full well that time premium was running. . first silly move. . I allowed as promised to 
give you authority. . you set a target. . it hit the traget, you moved in back. based on media reporting on 
trump visit? you didnt act. the market dipped and you panicked. . AMATEUR. wrong options wrong 
timing , no discipline and as a percentaage of investment, a one day dip fof 25%. wanting to buy the 
highter strike , is ok. but why the same month? why the same moment. why the same index. . sorry. I 
have taught this for many years. and your grade is an F. not one good move in many. . re 
broadcom. the crack happend in the morning, options were higher. no alternative presented. no 
analysis. , this is no way to manage money. I have lost a great deal of money hoping you would be able 
to do as you promised you could . would. . Had you told me, jeffrey I d like to try a new job as a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031815 
manager lets start slow I can learn. i would be less annoyed. you told me you had great confidence knew 
the risks and truly believed you would be able to raise money .do well and prosper. . If it were not 
you, this would have ended months ago.. we should work on a solution. not sure yet what shape it takes.
