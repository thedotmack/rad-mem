Subject: From Fox News - Jeffrey Epstein, registered sex offender, settles civil lawsuit and avoids testimony from alleged 
victims 
Importance: High 
Hope you are satisfied with the outcome all things considered. 
Ridiculous article. All of sudden the NPA in 's case goes from no 
jurisdiction even to prosecute to you avoiding a possible life 
sentence. Moronic. 
Man I sure would like to see you getting some in the W column though and 
some press that at least presents the true facts that some of the girls have 
admitted under oath. Still a story no one ever has heard and they are 
compelling facts. 
Good Shabbos. 
The numerous young women who say they were sexually abused by 
wealthy, Clinton-linked financier Jeffrey Epstein no longer appear set to 
testify after a last-minute settlement was reached in a closely-watched civil 
lawsuit against the registered sex offender.
