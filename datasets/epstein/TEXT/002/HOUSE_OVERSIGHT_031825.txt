Subject: From Fox News - Jeffrey Epstein, registered sex offender, settles civil lawsuit and avoids testimony from alleged 
victims 
Importance: High 
I know it was an old piece but Fox is running it again today. 
The numerous young women who say they were sexually abused by 
wealthy, Clinton-linked financier Jeffrey Epstein no longer appear set to 
testify after a last-minute settlement was reached in a closely-watched civil 
lawsuit against the registered sex offender.
