Suit Against California 
Relies on a Court Case 
Won by Obama in 2012 
tr. sac 
..Sre•pfzera shacleee, a law profes-
ses-et the Chzieersity of Tetras, said 
history was repeating itself, but 
backward. 
"The suit is modeled on the 
Marna administration's success-
ful suit against Arizona," he said. 
But he added that "some of the 
key considerations are flipped." 
In the Arizona case, conserva-
tives insisted that respect for state 
sovereignty required letting 
states play a leading role in con-
trolling immigration within their 
borders. But Mr. Sessions, a long-
time conservative himself, disa-
vowed that position in his speech 
on Wednesday. "Immigration law 
is the province of the federal gov-
ernment," he said. 
Justice Antonin Scalia, the con-
servative jurist who died in 2016, 
took a different view of the Ari-
zona case. In an impassioned par-
tial dissent, he wrote that "it is 
easy to lose sight of the states' tra-
ditional role in regulating immi-
gration — and to overlook their 
sovereign prerogative to do so." 
There is no doubt that the Cali-
fornia lawsuit is at odds with some 
of the Trump administration's 
usual positions. "It's a fascinating 
suit on a number of levels," Profes-
sor Vladeck said, "not the least of 
aznalosous contexts, 
Cristina nearigoes, a law pro-
at 'Yale said she detected 
political parallels between the two 
suits. 
"Both administrations claim 
that the state laws they challenge 
impermissibly interfere with the 
executive branch's ability to en-
force the immigration laws," she 
said. "But both lawsuits are also 
clearly designed to take on visible 
and politically powerful local offi-
cials whose vision of immigration 
policy conflicts with the presi-
dent's and his supporters'." 
In a news conference on 
Wednesday, Xavier Becerra, the 
California attorney general, said 
he was ready for the fight. The 
state's laws, he said, were "fully 
constitutional and provide for the 
safety and welfare of all our peo-
ple." 
"California is in the business of 
public safety," he said. "We are not 
in the business of deportations?' 
The Justice Department chal-
lenged parts of three of Califor-
nia's so-called sanctuary laws. 
One restricts employers from co-
operating with immigration offi-
cials. A second generally prohibits 
state officials from telling federal 
ones when undocumented immi-
grants are to be released from

The state may not 
pursue policies that 
undermine federal 
law,' a justice wrote. 
the commandeering issue was a 
substantial one. "To the ?xtenttlie-,_ 
Trump administration s claims 
against California would produce 
an outcome that would effectively 
force states and localities to par-
ticipate m immigration enforce-
ment; she said,'. there couldhe an 
unconstitutional commandeer-
ing:" 
Professor Spiro said that Cali-
fornia may have the upper hand in 
the suit's early stages, as the is-
sues in it are novel, leaving judges 
with substantial discretion. 
The Trump administration has 
not fared well in federal courts in 
California in other cases concern-
ing immigration, including ones 
challenging President Trump's ef-
forts to restrict travel from pre-
dominantly Muslim countries and 
to rescind a program protecting 
some 700,000 young unauthorized 
immigrants from deportation. 
But the ultimate fate of the suit 
will probably rest with the Su-
preme Court. In 2012, with what 
may have been unwarranted opti-
mism Justice Kennedy said he 
hoped that conflicts over immi-
gration policy would be worked 
out through reasoned discussion. 
"The national government has 
significant power to regulate im-
migration," he wrote. "The sound 
exercise of national power over 
immigration depends on the na-
tion's meeting its responsibility to 
base its laws on a political will in-
formed by searching, thoughtful, 
rational civic discourse?' 
state custody. A third requires 
state officials to inspect some fa-
cilities that house people detained 
on behalf of the federal govern-
ment. 
Jennifer Chacon, a law profes-
sor at the University of California, 
Irvine, said the state laws had 
been carefully written to avoid di-
rect conflicts with federal immi-
gration laws. "I think it is clear 
that California deliberately tried 
to draft laws that involved core ex-
ercises of state police power in a 
way that did not run afoul of fed-
eral law," she said. 
Each state law presents differ-
ent issues, and courts may give 
varying answers depending on 
how directly the state laws con-
flict with federal ones. More gen-
erally, though, courts will take ac-
count of the Supreme Court's deci-
sion in the Arizona case, which 
called for collaboration rather 
than conflict. 
"Consultation between federal 
and state officials is an important 
feature of the immigration sys-
tem?' Justice Kennedy wrote in 
the court's decision in the Arizona 
case. 
Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, 
has said that consultation is fine 
but that federal officials should 
not use California's resources to 
pursue undocumented Californi-
ans. The federal government, he 
added, may do so on its own. 
"They are free to use their own 
considerable resources to enforce 
federal immigration law in Cali-
fornia," he said in October in sign-
ing one of the challenged laws. 
The Supreme Court has said 
that the federal government may 
not commandeer state resources 
to achieve federal objectives. In 
his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Ses-
sions denied that anything like 
that was afoot. 
"Contrary to what you might 
hear from the lawless open bor-
ders radicals," he said, "we are not 
asking California, Oakland or any-
one else to enforce immigration 
laws." 
"We are simply asking Califor-
nia and other sanctuary jurisdic-
tions to stop actively obstructing 
federal law enforcement," he add-
ed.

Investigating Sexual Misconduct Accusations, Arizona State Suspends a Physicist 
By KENNETH CHANG 
Arizona State University has 
suspended Lawrence M. Krauss, 
a prominent theoretical physicist, 
while the university investigates 
accusations of sexual misconduct 
over a decade. 
"In an effort to avoid further 
disruption to the normal course of 
business as the university contin-
ues to gather facts about the alle-
gations, Krauss has been placed 
on paid leave and is prohibited 
from being on campus for the du-
ration of the review," the univer-
sity said in a statement released 
on Thesday. 
Last month, BuzzFeed reported 
that several women have accused 
Dr. Krauss of inappropriate be-
havior including groping women 
and making sexist jokes. 
The university said it would not

release any additional details until 
its investigation is complete. 
Dr. Krauss, a professor in the 
university's School of Earth and 
Space Exploration, is director of 
Arizona State's Origins Project, a 
multidisciplinary research effort 
to tackle questions about life, the 
universe and complex social prob-
lems. He gained prominence for 
his book, "The Physics of Star 
Trek" in 1995. He later became one 
of the leaders of the so-called 
"skeptics" movement that es-
pouses science over religion. He 
has also written essays and Op-Ed 
articles that were published in 
The Times. 
Michael Crow, president of Ari-
zona State, told The State Press, 
an independent student news or-
ganization, that the university had 
received no complaints of har-
assment against Dr. Krauss. The 
university started the investiga-
tion after being contacted by Buz-
zFeed. 
Dr. Krauss moved to Arizona 
State from Case Western Reserve 
University in Ohio in 2008. 
Lawrence M. Krauss is direc-

search effort to tackle ques-
