I'm a reporter at CNN, and my colleague Blake Ellis and I have read that Bill Clinton and Donald 
Trump have both visited Epstein's private island. We are trying to determine whether there is any 
truth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors 
while there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing 
to speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --
we are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press. 
If you don't feel comfortable sharing anything via social media or email, feel free to send us any 
documentation/proof that might be helpful anonymously via mail:

Thanks so much,
