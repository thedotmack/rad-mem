If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Arianna 
Huffington from me 
Did you know why Prince Alberts Charlene fled to the airport with a one way ticket back to South Africa? Because she found out 
about a third illegitimate child that is 3 months old...the palace officials followed her to the airport and propably made her an offer she 
could not refuse.. will get details from Jim Coleman when he comes home Sunday night. 
In Southampton now. Peg

Subject: 
should you point out to Ariana Huff, that the same type of person, same as strauss Kahn i s Andrews accuser, long criminal record. 
total liar. Ariana should champion the dangers of false allegations. send a reporter or reporters to investigate,., the palace would love 
it, the girl in the photo , was nothing more than a telephone answerer„ she was never 15, according to her version she worked for 
trump , first at that age, at MAra lago. ITs ridiculous, but the press like strauss kahn is afraid to question women.
