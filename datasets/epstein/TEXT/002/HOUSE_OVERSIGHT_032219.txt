I wish I had a reason to go to Paris this weekend. I am headed to LA now for two events and meetings. Back 
late Friday. I am thrilled we got my money. I loved the lawyer Martin telling me I deserved more. Made me 
hate my idiot brother even more. We are ahead of billing from last year and it's the quiet time. Will stay in 
touch. How are you doing. Has all that vile publicity finally gone away for good or do the keep stirring the 
pot for more blackmail money every few months. Hope you are well. Just spent the weekend at David Koch's 
in palm beach. He had a lunch for 70. Including 9 acting republican governors, Pataki, Giuliani, trump, Wilbur 
ross, Was fascinating Xoxo. Peggy
