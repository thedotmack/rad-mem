Going up to NY Friday morning. Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on 
the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have 
a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food 
for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people.
