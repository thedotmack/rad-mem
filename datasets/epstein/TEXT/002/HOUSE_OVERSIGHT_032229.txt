I think you should let him hang himself If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives 
you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive 
benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is 
possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political 
correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.
