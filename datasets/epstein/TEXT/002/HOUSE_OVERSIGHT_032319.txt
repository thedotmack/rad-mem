Hi Jeffrey, 
Looks like Trump is back in game. We processed 11 million tweets this week for Trump and 50.03% are 
positive and only 20.66% are negative whereas Clinton is 56.05% negative and 20.03% positive. 
We are trying to correlate that into popular vote outcome and electoral votes received. 
Regards, 
Zubair

Hi Jeffrey, 
We are in the process of removing data from bots and making a clean report which I will share with you in few 
hours. Overall Trump is way more popular than Clinton.
