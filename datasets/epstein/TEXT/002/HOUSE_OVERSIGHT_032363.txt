Putin? NATO? Those were the points my sister raised that were concerning. 
Will meet you in Boston or NYC sometime. Curious to hear your thinking.

I am looking at this from over here in Germany. American politics gets reduced in the end to only a few issues: 
pro-life or pro-choice, gun laws, and establishment vs. anti-establishment. Political categories are so wishy 
washy and intermingled with what is termed 'liberal' and 'conservative' that one forgets what they actually 
mean. 
Of course, not everybody who voted for Trump is sexist or a racist, but, on some level, they didn't care if he is. 
He knew how to gather momentum with the discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone, he has let 
loose a storm. We will brace ourselves over here for Putin's eventual takeover of the Baltic States. Putin has 
extended his power back into Republic of Georgia, the Crimea, and Armenia. Trump has said that he would 
not come to the aid of Nato allies if they were attacked. IS is the least of our problems here in Germany; 
Erdogan is a much larger threat, for now. 
I don't see Hillary Clinton as being at fault. I see the growth of nationalism (all throughout the world, not just 
in the USA) and an underestimation of the fear that non-Hispanic whites have about the trajectory they are on 
to become a minority (in the USA and other European countries). 
Every news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout of Trump's win. German 
politicians are hoping to learn from it, to stem the growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as I know, 
Merkel is the only leader who congratulated Trump with a warning.
