Any further intel on Treasury? Priebus choice suggests to me that he may go for a bigger name in 
treasury than Mnuchin. Someone to underscore/push forward this notion that he is Reagan 2.0 (as 
some are suggesting). I am just not sure who that person would be. The Trump trade certainly seems 
to have legs -- all the Hillary loving hedgies I am talking to are congratulating themselves for making 
so much money last week. They are all Trump lovers now!
