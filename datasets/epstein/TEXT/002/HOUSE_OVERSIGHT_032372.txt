yeah, but that was a smart move -- made him look presidential. everything he has done so far suggests 
to me he is going to do what you told me months ago: appoint competent people beneath him who he 
trusts AND who will not fuck things up. Christie was not one of those people.

Any further intel on Treasury? Priebus choice suggests to me that he may go for a bigger name in 
treasury than Mnuchin. Someone to underscore/push forward this notion that he is Reagan 2.0 
(as some are suggesting). I am just not sure who that person would be. The Trump trade certainly 
seems to have legs -- all the Hillary loving hedgies I am talking to are congratulating themselves 
for making so much money last week. They are all Trump lovers now!
