Who is the guy you have set me up with? 
Spend zero effort on anything about me w trump. Seeing his approach to conflict of interest, his Putin 
proximity, and his mindless response on Castro death I'm best off a million miles away. 
Until they are deeply humbled by the fuckups that are sure to come, I serve myself and country best by doing 
nothing that involves loyalty to them.
