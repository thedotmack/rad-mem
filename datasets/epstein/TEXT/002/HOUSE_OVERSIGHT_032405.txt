Why You and the Universe Are One

The accepted view of reality holds that human beings exist in the 
context of a vast physical universe "out there." Sir John Eccles, a 
famous British neurologist and Nobel laureate, declared, "I want 
you to realize that there exists no color in the natural world, and no 
sound — nothing of this kind; no textures, no patterns, no beauty, 
no scent." What Eccles means is that all the qualities of Nature, 
from the luxurious scent of a rose to the sting of a wasp and the 
taste of honey, are produced by human beings. The most distant 
galaxies billions of light years away, have no reality without you, 
because everything that makes any galaxy real— with the multitude 
of stars with their heat, emitted light, and masses, the positions of 
the distant galaxies in space and the velocity that carries each 
distant galaxy away at enormous speed—requires a human 
observer with a human nervous system. There are extremely faint 
traces of photon activity in the brain, but the optic nerve doesn't 
transmit photons to the visual

Responding to another physicist who said "None of

Response 
"That's because it isn't, and everyone here 
(apparently save one) is rational and objective enough 
to understand that. Physical phenomena, and 
phenomena in general, are 
ultimately perceptual in nature and subject to 
observational replication - that's why they call 
physics an empirical science. But consciousness is 
not. 
Consciousness cannot be objectively, replicably 
observed. Its putative physical correlates, including

brains and behaviors, can be replicably observed, and 
it can be subjectively 
apprehended by any conscious entity. But that's it. 
Anyone who denies this understands neither physics 
nor consciousness, and has a severe logic problem to 
boot, inasmuch as he/she cannot properly distinguish 
between cognition and perception or internal and 
external state. 
This isn't "polemics". This is just the way it is. Stop 
overreaching.
