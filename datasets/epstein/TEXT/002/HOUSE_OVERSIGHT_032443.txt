Dear Jeffrey: 
Attached, as promised, is our proposal for Closer To Truth to produce the definitive television series on "The 
Science of Sleep and Dreams" - 13 episodes, a full season, on —200 PBS stations, plus extensive web videos. 
Contemporary advances in sleep/dream research makes timing propitious. 
Three documents: 
1) Proposal (12 pages) 
2) Budget (line item) 
3) Schedule (weekly) 
Please confirm receipt. 
I'll be in New York from January 19 until about February 8. Love to meet - on Sleep/Dreams and all sorts of 
fun stuff to cheer our 2017. 
Robert
