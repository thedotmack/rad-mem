Patrick had John (who I assume is a manage for NY) call me. I gave him your Cc# so he could call PB and try 
to get the appt with Jerome ...but unfortunately he was unsuccessful as well. They are "in season" and are super 
busy. Once again, I am told if they get a cancellation we are the first call. I am also told since Trump is there 
and traffic is bad so people may cancel as they don't want to go out in the mess.
