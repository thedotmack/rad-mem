So...I'm doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation from them (DT 
called me the other day and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--alarming). I 
wonder if you could introduce me to Tom Barrack--just to say I'm a journalist who you know and trust, and that 
I'll follow up with a description of the project that I'm doing. Also, I'd love a reintroduction to Kathy Ruemmler. 
I need some off-the-record perspective on White House procedures. 
Are you in NYC soon?
