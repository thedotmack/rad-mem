Dear Jeffrey, You mentioned you were friends with Tom Barrack and I wondered if you might introduce me to 
him. As discussed, I'm doing a book on the first 100 days of the Trump White House--POTUS and key staff 
know all about it and are cooperating--and would love to chat with Tom on or off the record. Thanks in advance 
and look forward to seeing you soon. All best, Michael

So...I'm doing this Trump book for a pile of money and with so far quite a bit of cooperation from them (DT 
called me the other day and spent 45 minutes on the phone ranting and raving about the media--alarming). I 
wonder if you could introduce me to Tom Barrack--just to say I'm a journalist who you know and trust, and 
that I'll follow up with a description of the project that I'm doing. Also, I'd love a reintroduction to Kathy 
Ruemmler. I need some off-the-record perspective on White House procedures. 
Are you in NYC soon?
