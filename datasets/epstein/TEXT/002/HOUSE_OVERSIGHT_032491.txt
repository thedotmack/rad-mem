Thanks Darren 
Good news! 
I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will 
use mostly wires. 
Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends I would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when I need to. 
When I use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in 
multiple currencies, but I am not familiar with DB. 
Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed. 
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, I will also need to have someone 
keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be need for 
some work on my side before final filing is done. 
On the other hand, if there is a "checks and balances" control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers 
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent. 
Please do let me know. 
We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time) 
In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

There is $1mm in the bank account. We can prepare checks or wires for you to sign upon request. This way 
book keeping gets done at same time. Just send back up with each request. How does that sound?

Hi Jeffrey 
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number I should reach. 
Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or 
anything of the kind. 
All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their 
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already 
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home). 
The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great 
artists when they need it. 
Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go 
directly to the source. 
This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet, 
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect in 
person. 
The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source. 
Once again, not sure was drifted away from this in communication
