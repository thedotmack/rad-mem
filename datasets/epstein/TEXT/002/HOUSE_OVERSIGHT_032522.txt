I was never worried about space.. I always knew he was enamored with human space exploration because it is 
big and showy.. I even wrote that in print early on.. for him that is science.. it isn't for those of us who know.. it 
is more bad news as far as I am concerned because this big budget will decimate real science.. 900 million cut 
in DOE office fo science will kill particle physics.. will end funding for me, for example..

All shoe. This is not supporting science. It is all about the size of the rocket for him. All this will do is give him 
glory and not contribute to science.
