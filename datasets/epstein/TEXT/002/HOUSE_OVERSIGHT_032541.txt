Importance: High 
Appreciate consideration. I'm next in NY June 7 (for about a week); love to brainstorm.... I too would really 
like to do something (important) together. 
Just arrived in Beijing for the "The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" (commentating), the 
second most important event of 2017 in China (after the upcoming Party Congress), but Western media not 
paying much attention, what with All-Things-Trump.
