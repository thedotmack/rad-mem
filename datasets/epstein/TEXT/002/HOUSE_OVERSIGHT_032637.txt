Importance: High 
You nailed it! (before —1/2 of family). 
Still in China - from Party Congress through Trump "State+ Visit". Many interviews/commentaries (CNN/BBC 
attached). 
More important (from some ultimate reference frame): Radical Breakthroughs. Preproduction going well; 
expect to send by end of month complete preproduction document, with 3-4 pages on each of the 13 episodes - 
refined versions of the prototypes (first two episodes) I sent you in late Sept. Excited. Looking forward to 
discussing content. 
I'll be in NY from —Nov. 21/22 through early January. When to meet? Breakthroughs and of course politics / 
geopolitics (so much).
