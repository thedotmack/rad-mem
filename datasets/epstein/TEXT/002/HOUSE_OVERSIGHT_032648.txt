Shouldn't be to bad if we are leaving early and Trump is not scheduled to depart until 3pm on Sunday, the 
Departure will be similar to a DCA Departure with Customs, 
TSA will have an office set up inside the FBO, you will enter the main lobby at Atlantic and be escorted to the 
plane after you meet with TSA officers., 
I have to schedule all passengers names 24hours in advance, no additions within 24 Hours, 
Thx
