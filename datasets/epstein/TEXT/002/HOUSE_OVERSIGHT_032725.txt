Not sure if realistic but trump may impact 5g and not sure if net positive or negative for this potential 
investment.

Hi Jeff, 
I realize the last term sheet was a draft, my fault (my computer sync'd the draft with the same name). 
Here is a correct version, the last page is the signature page. It would be great if I could get this back 
tomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those 
discussions the end of next week. 
Things are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow 
discussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. lgbps in a self-install package would be the last 
step. 
We will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston. 
I met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John 
Hancock. 
Fun Stuff and great to be doing something together!
