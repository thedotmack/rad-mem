GORDON GETTY ON DONALD TRUMP

CALL TO ACTION

--

Gruterites,

What prompted my first memo was a concern that we have a psychopath or sociopath or malignant narcissist or narcissist or Mach (Machiavellian) in the White House, whether or not those categories grade into a continuum. What might be the remedy? To start, someone should get the word out.

It isn’t about partisanship. The far left, with its ancient forbears such as Marius or Peisistratos, has shown equal menace or worse. It’s about fitness for office. The President is the world’s number one fiduciary. A fiduciary puts the trust first. Persons without empathy or remorse are not prudent choices.

By book, I mean a collection of papers along the lines of “Moral Markets.” A mass-market book would be even better if one of us is up for it and up to it.
If I am right in fitting the president somewhere in the groups I listed, the nation faces a different and deeper crisis than many had thought. That clarifies the question and its urgency. We may or may not reach consensus on the answer. Each of us will decide separately, as always, on what is relevant and where logic leads. The overall theme might be something like “personality disorders in leadership.” There would be attention, but not exclusive attention, to which shoe if any fits the President.
