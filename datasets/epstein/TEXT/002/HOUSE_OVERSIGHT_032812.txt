The Guardian has learned that Rubenfeld is currently the subject of an internal investigation at Yale. The 
investigation is focused on Rubenfeld's conduct, particularly with female law students. Students have also 
raised related concerns to Yale authorities about Chua's powerful influence in the clerkships process. The 
investigation was initiated before Kavanaugh was nominated by Donald Trump to serve on the high court. 
Rubenfeld said in a statement to the Guardian: "In June, Yale University informed me that it would conduct 
what it terms an 'informal review' of certain allegations, but that to preserve anonymity, I was not entitled to 
know any specifics. As a result, I do not know what I am alleged to have said or done. I was further advised that 
the allegations were not of the kind that would jeopardize my position as a long-tenured member of the faculty.
