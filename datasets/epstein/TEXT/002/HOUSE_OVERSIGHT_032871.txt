Keep getting calls from that guy doing a book on you -- John Connolly. He seems very interested 
in your relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said 
he had been told that that quote from Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been 
manufactured. ie, that I did not actually speak to Donald. Which is bull shit of course. I am sure 
that is what Trump told him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you. 
He actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had 
with him. I think he is close to finishing up. 
Did you ever speak to him?
