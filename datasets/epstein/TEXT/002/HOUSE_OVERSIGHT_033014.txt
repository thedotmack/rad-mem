Jeffrey, 
Huffington Post is almost done with their article. They need couple answers to use them for your quotes. 
Please see below. 
Questions for you: 
1. As a result of Trump's budget cuts, more scientists are turning to private donors for funds. How have you 
helped these scientists thrive during this time in particular? 
2. Why do you think it's important to have funded the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and how will this 
program help us in the future? 
Questions for a scientist (can I ask Martin to answer and quote him)? 
1. How has Jeffery Epstein's donations helped you advance your research? 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Would appreciate speedy response. 
Thank you! 
Masha
