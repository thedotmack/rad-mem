Importance: High 
We have processed 943,338 tweets since the start of the presidential debate till now. 
Clinton's popularity has increased dramatically since the debate. According to our recent data, 62% support 
Clinton and 38% Trump. 
Clinton is now more popular in New York, California and Michigan. She is likely to win in these states with 
huge margins. Clinton has also gained popularity in Texas (Clinton 65% - Trump 35%). 
Trump has huge support in Ohio (90% Trump - 10% Clinton) and in New Jersey.

Hi Jeffrey, 
Please find attached InsightsPod business plan for your consideration. 
Since Twitter is live streaming the presidential debates, the social media activity will accelerate and it will help 
us in making better predictions of outcome. It was apparent from the US Election report, which I sent you 
previously that we need a Data Scientist who can translate our data into better insights. Taking this into 
account I hope you can help us by backing this venture. 
Thanks, 
Zubair
