Hi Jeffrey ! ! 
Thank you for writing. I'm doing well. Looking forward for winter season in the Alps! 
I have from Zurich as assistant for you. I sent you her photos once :) lives in New Jersey 
now and in Paris!! 
I have some new ones here in zurich but not in NY or Paris yet. 
How is it going with Zubair? 
Do you believe Trump will win or Hilary ? 
I miss Berkeley so much. This California lifestyle was magical. Can't wait to be back for 2nd semester C) 
I plan to pass NY or California bar and be attorney in USA. I love America and the win mentality in your 
country. 
Kind regards,
