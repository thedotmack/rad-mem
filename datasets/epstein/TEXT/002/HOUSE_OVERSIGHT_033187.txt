You are a prophet.. 
was just with senior leaders in Beijing.. 
I'll be discussing China-U.S. relations under "President Trump" with the former Chinese Ambassador to the 
U.S on CCTV News ("Closer To china"), broadcast in china and internationally (NY - "CCTV News" channel) - 
Saturday at 8:30 pm and Sunday at 8:30 am New York time. Not an interview - we will each question each 
other 
we're playing in new territory here. There may be some contributions we can make. To be discussed 
privately. I return to Los Angeles on Nov. 17, but dont get to NY until Dec. 24, after my next trip to 
Beijing.
