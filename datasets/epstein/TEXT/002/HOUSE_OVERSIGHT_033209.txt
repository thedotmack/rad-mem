Dear Lesley, 
HORRORS! 
I have committed the (to me) unpardonable error of inflicting upon Jeffrie -- today on the phone - a false 
anagram. Please spare him the pain of passing it on in its erroneous form. 
Here is the correct version: 
The letters in PRESIDENT TRUMP -- re-arranged -- spell: MR. PUTIN'S RED PET. 
Thanks, Lesley. The chicken matter touches my heart. Dick C.
