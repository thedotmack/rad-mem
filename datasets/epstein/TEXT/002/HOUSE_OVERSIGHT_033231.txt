New Delhi,29 March 
The Monday night phone call 
of US President Donald Trump 
to Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi could pave the way for an 
early visit of the Indian PM to 
Washington. The Trump 
administration is keen to host 
Modi. But South Block is look-
ing at the potential deliverables 
from such a visit, particularly 
on H1B visas. The Indian PM's 
political stature has increased 
manifold after his recent elec-
toral successes, while Trump's 
presidential tenure has moved 
from one problem to another. 
Delhi doesn't want Modi to 
invest his substantial political 
capital to help Trump burnish 
his image, without the visit 
yielding positive results for the 
Indian side. Modi is scheduled 
to visit New York to attend the 
UN General Assembly in 
September. But, the Trump-
Modi telephonic conversation 
has indicated to South Block, 
and to those who look at foreign 
policy issues within the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 
that the Trump administration 
is keen to host the Indian PM 
for a bilateral visit in the next 
couple of months. 
Earlier this month, Foreign 
Secretary S Jaishankar, accom-
panied by Commerce Secretary 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
Rita Teaotia, was in the US. Last 
week, National Security Advisor 
Ajit Kumar Doval was also on a 
visit to the US. External Affairs 
Minister Sushma Swaraj and US 
Secretary of State Rex W 
US President Donald Trump 
Tillerson had also recently spo-
ken over the phone. 
In his phone call, Trump 
congratulated Modi on his 
recent state election victories, 
expressed support for his eco-
nomic reforms and said he had 
great respect for Indians, and 
said he looked forward to host-
ing the PM later this year. 
The window for such a visit is 
available in May, as well as in 
June after the PM attends the 
Shanghai Cooperation Organ-
isation Summit in Kazakhstan 
in the second week.The PM's US 
visit could take place before his 
visit to Hamburg, in Germany, to 
attend the G20 Summit on July 
7-8, and his bilateral visit to Israel 
around that time. 
It will be the first-ever visit of 
an Indian PM to Israel. The 
highlight of his policy changes 
will be the PM's outreach to the 
Indian diaspora there. Israel has 
85,000 Jews of Indian origin. 
Jews are an influential commu-
nity in the US, and some of 
these groups had engaged with 
Modi even during his time as 
the Gujarat chief minister. 
According to a source, Modi's 
visit to the US before Tel Aviv 
could help the PM engage with 
the Jewish community there, 
which would contribute to the 
success of his Israel visit. 
On Tuesday, the Indo-
American Chamber of 
Commerce urged an early visit 
of the PM to the US to "sort out 
the apprehensions" of the Indian 
industry on the negative impact 
of tightening of visa rules relat-
ing to H1B and Li visas.
