Importance: High 
Dear Jeffrey: 
Trust all is well. We are in full pre-production of our "Radical Breakthroughs" series/season for Closer To 
Truth. We expect to have a complete production plan, with contributors, locations and schedule, by mid/late 
November - when (coincidentally) I will be back in NY. 
My next email will add detail, including first (rough) outlines of the first two episodes. I'll be copying the 
producer/director of Closer To Truth, as I will from now on with all reports/communications related to the 
content of the series. Whenever we want to communicate privately, about the series/grant or anything else, 
please use a separate email (or respond to this one). 
I am in Santa Monica for two weeks, then Beijing for the big Party Congress. I may need to stay until after 
Trump's (supposed) visit. Attached are my two recent BBC commentaries on China (N.Korea bomb and 
Myanmar refugees). 
Always available to Skype. 
I am truly excited about the series - nothing like it, could have impact - and I deeply appreciate your 
generosity/support, confidence and trust. 
Take care and warm regards, 
Robert
