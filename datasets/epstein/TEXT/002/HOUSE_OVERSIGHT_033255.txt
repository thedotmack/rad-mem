Hi Jeffrey, I was happy to meet you this morning. 
person) 
You asked to see some things I've written. Here's my (only slightly out of date) professional web presence, including 
Letterman clip:

Here are a few stories I've written more recently that are not displayed on my site:

You might get a special kick out of this Trump story:

What kinds of media goals/story ideas are interesting to you? Masha has made it clear that she wants me to write 
something about you, but that's much more your call to make. I suggest that there is mileage to be gained by quoting you 
in a story about how proper implementation of cryptocurrency might solve financial corruption issues. 
I travel back to Austin, Texas tomorrow evening, but am of course reachable. Thanks again for your time this morning.
