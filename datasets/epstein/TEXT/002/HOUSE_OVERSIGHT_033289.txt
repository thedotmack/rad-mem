Mr. Weinberg 
I was referred to you by Alan Dershowitz, who told me you're Jeffrey Epstein's attorney. 
If this is the case, I was hoping to reach him through you to see if he'd be willing to speak on the record about 
his ties - or previous ties - to both the Clintons and Donald Trump? 
Would you be able to arrange a call or email exchange this week? 
Thanks for your consideration.
