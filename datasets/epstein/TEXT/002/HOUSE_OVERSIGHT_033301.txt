Dear Barry, 
When it comes to describing Donald Trump's private jet, the word 
"impressive" would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party 
nominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen 
and he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed "Trump Force One," the 
luxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a 
52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is 
estimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the 
White House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the 
presidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by 
the president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign 
when the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few 
regrets if he becomes president? 
Even though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a 
larger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force

One's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about 
6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be 
refuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. 
The two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation 
comes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 
is just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher 
bill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force 
One but Air Force One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and 
facilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. 
There is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding 
to afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear 
attack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One, 
he probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential 
suite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world.
