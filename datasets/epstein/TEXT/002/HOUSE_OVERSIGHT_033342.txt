spoke to TSA at Palm Bch Atlantic, 
Once the President departs Palm Beach area, the TFR (temporary flight restriction) is lifted, 
we should be able to land in RBI., 
currently the TFR expires at 10:30pm„ the superbowl is typically 3 hours long, it starts at 6:30pm„ 
Only a guess, Trump will leave around 10pm is my guess.
