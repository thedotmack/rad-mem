Importance: High 
I spoke to my FAA in Orlando, it will take the buyer 6 months to obtain a FAR125 certificate if we do not include ours, 
Darren and Rich are working on possibility of including JEGE, INC with sale of Boeing, this will be valuable to buyer and 
prove to be beneficial monetarily to you if we can include the company name in the sale. FAA informs me its taken 
under into consideration on a case by case basis if they will approve another buyer to operate my FAR125 certificate. My 
FAA inspector did mention that Trump did the same deal when he purchased his B757, it included the manuals and 
company.

Jeffrey, 
I spoke to Gary and he agrees to make a counter offer, do you agree with the following: 
-Counter the offer at $2.750M 
-deal to include my FAR125 certificate, along with the company name: JEGE, Inc. this provides the buyer with ease of 
transition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value to buyer,. 
-Buyer understands purchase is "As Is" but has the opportunity to visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my 
records. 
-closing to be on December 30th 2013. 
-Buyer will pay round trip repositioning expense Brunswick GA to Palm Beach and return to Brunswick if buyer declines 
the aircraft (fuel cost round trip $14,930.00). 
-Seller will deduct the reposition expense if buyer proceeds with purchase. (fuel expense to fly B727 to Palm Beach is 
$7,465.00). 
is this approved? 
thank you, 
Larry
