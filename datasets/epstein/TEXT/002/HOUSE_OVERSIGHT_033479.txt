AS TRUMP SILENCES 
DISSENT IN CABINET 
Pick for CLA. Chief 
Ran Secret Prison 
By ADAM GOLDMAN 
WASHINGTON — Just over a 
year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the 
C.I.A. dispatched the veteran 
clandestine officer Gina Haspel to 
oversee a secret prison in Thai-
land. Shortly after, agency con-
tractors in the frantic hunt for the 
conspirators waterhoarded a 
Qaeda suspect three times and 
subjected him to brutal interroga-
tion techniques. 
Ms. Haspel's time running the 
prison, code-named Cat's Eye, be-
gan her deep involvement in the 
agency's counterterrorism opera-
tions and showed her willingness 
to take part in the agency's rendi-
tion, detention and interrogation 
program, which shaped her ca-
reer. She was a rising star until 
that dark chapter in C.I.A. history 
began to emerge publicly. 
But under President Trump, 
her fortunes 
changed, and 
on Tuesday, he 
announced that 
he intended to 
name her direc-
tor of the C.I.A.

WASHINGTON — President 
Trump ousted his secretary ot 
state, Rex W. Tillerson, on Tues-
day, the most dramatic in a cas-
cade of personnel moves that sug-
gest Mr. Trump is determined to 
surround himself with loyalists 
more willing to reflect his "Amer-
ica First" views. 
Mr. Trump announced he would 
replace Mr. Tillerson with Mike 
Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and 
former Tea Party congressman, 
who has cultivated a close rela-
tionship with the president and 
has taken a harder line than Mr. 
Tillerson on critical issues like 
Iran and North Korea. 
Mr. Tillerson's dismissal, on the 
heels of Gary D. Cohn's resigna-
tion as Mr. Trump's chief eco-
nomic adviser after a dispute ovel 
steel tariffs, pulls the Trump acl 
ministration further out of the eel 
nomic and foreign policy mai 
stream and closer to the nation 
ist ideas that animated 
Trump's 2016 presidential c 
paign.
