Howard Schult 
By Daryl Cagle on Feb 09, 2019 12:13 pm 
I forgot to post my cartoon from week before last, about Howard Schultz, the prospective independent presidential 
candidate, billionaire and Starbucks magnate. Schultz threatens to split the vote for a Democratic party candidate, 
possibly throwing the election to Donald Trump.

The two legged Starbucks mermaid logo is so disturbing that I love to 
draw it whenever I can. Here's the original Starbucks logo, that customers didn't like. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033570 
The logo was intended to depict the merger of two coffee companies, the original Starbucks and Howard Schultz's 
company, // Gomale that purchased Starbucks. Starbucks has a nautical theme to go with the character of Seattle. 
"Starbuck" was the name of the first mate in the novel Moby Dick. 
This two legged, merger-mermaid is nasty, which makes it great fodder for cartoons. I drew the mermaid last year when 
there was a racism scandal at Starbucks, leading the company to shut down for a day to do racial sensitivity training. This 
logo-fish-girl would scare anybody!

Jeff Bezos and David Pecker 
By Daryl Cagle on Feb 08, 2019 06:04 pm 
Here's my new cartoon on the world's richest man, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and the National Enquirer's (AM I) CEO David 
Pecker, who was blackmailing Bezos. Pecker's AMI was extorting Bezos, demanding that the Washington Post (which 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033571 
Bezos owns) hold back publication on their investigation of AMI, and that Bezos stop a private investigator he hired to look 
into AMI — otherwise they would publish photos of Bezos' penis. Bezos was brave to expose Pecker's extortion. 
It is interesting that Pecker and AMI seems to have such success with blackmail that his attorneys didn't step back to think 
of what would happen if the person they were blackmailing simply made their emails public. 
AMI is looking pretty sleazy these days, with likely links to Saudi Arabia, and a reported safe full of Donald Trump secrets, 
among other tawdry stuff. So, I took advantage of Pecker's dickish name and pulled Pecker's pants down. Some cartoons 
are fun to draw — even if editors won't publish them much.
