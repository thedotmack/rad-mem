## Entry 151: USER

**Content:**
```
I have a question regarding the context timeline that we made. and it's a bit of a thinker...

when i first started out working on claude-mem my idea was using a fast index of memories with links to access them on demand. I thought that claude-mem would be searching for all the things it needed to get the job done, but what I found is that the description of the work done + the files touched actually improved performance tremendously, and without actively searching for things constantly.

I just had a thought that maybe claude isn't searching, because when it reads what it did, it already "knows" how it did that, for the most part. Would you say I'm on the right track? I want you to ultrathink about WHY claude-mem's session start context works so well, from your OWN perspective
