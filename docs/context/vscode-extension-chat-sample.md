# VS Code Extension Chat Sample Repository (GitHub Snapshot)

The markitdown MCP fetch for `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-sample` returned only the public navigation scaffolding for GitHub. No repository-specific content or README data was captured because the site requires client-side execution that the fetcher cannot perform.

You can browse the repository directly for full details:

_Fetched on 2025-11-12 via markitdown MCP. Content retrieval was limited to GitHub's static navigation shell._
