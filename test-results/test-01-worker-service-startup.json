[{"type":"text","text":"## Search Results Return Structured Observation Content with Rich Metadata\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10695*\n\n**Worker service query returned six observations with complete narratives, facts, concepts, and source links**\n\nExamination of test-01-worker-service-startup.json reveals the structure and quality of search API responses. The worker service startup query successfully retrieved six relevant observations demonstrating that FTS5 keyword search provides meaningful results. Each observation includes comprehensive metadata: title, subtitle (one-line summary), full narrative text explaining the context, structured facts list with specific details, concept tags (what-changed, how-it-works, problem-solution, gotcha), associated file paths, creation dates, and observation type classification. Results are formatted with source links using the claude-mem://observation/ID format for easy reference. The retrieved observations span multiple aspects of worker service startup including port file handling migration to plugin data directory, getPackageRoot path resolution dependencies, comprehensive production failure analysis documenting 8 critical issues causing 100% failure rate, and ChromaSync initialization timing problems. The diversity of observation types and relevance to the search query demonstrates the search system's ability to provide rich, contextual results for SessionStart injection.\n\n---\nType: discovery | Facts: Search API returns observations with title, subtitle, full narrative, structured facts list, concept tags, file paths, creation dates, and observation type; Results tagged with source links using claude-mem://observation/ID format for reference; Worker service startup query retrieved six relevant observations spanning October 18 to November 17, 2025; Retrieved observations include diverse types (change, discovery, bugfix) covering port file handling, getPackageRoot issues, production failures, and ChromaSync initialization; Test result format stores array of observation objects with type and text fields containing formatted markdown content | Concepts: how-it-works, pattern | Files: test-results/test-05-pm2-decision.json, test-results/test-01-worker-service-startup.json\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:52:44 PM\n\n---\n\n## Test Results Return Full Observation Content with Metadata\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10649*\n\n**Worker service startup query retrieved six relevant observations with complete details, context, and source links**\n\nThe first test result file revealed the structure and quality of search API responses.

The build process compiled all TypeScript hooks (context-hook, new-hook, save-hook, summary-hook, cleanup-hook, user-message-hook), the worker service, and the search server into their final JavaScript distributions. The React-based viewer UI was also bundled with its associated assets including fonts and icons. After successful compilation, the entire plugin directory was synchronized to the Claude marketplace location using rsync, transferring 11,751 files while excluding .git directories. The deployment concluded with an npm install to refresh dependencies and a worker service restart to activate the newly built code. This pipeline ensures that all code changes are properly compiled, deployed, and running in the Claude environment.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Package claude-mem version 6.0.9 successfully built all components; Built components include worker-service.cjs (1337.16 KB), search-server.mjs (332.02 KB), and seven hooks ranging from 2.24 KB to 38.29 KB; React viewer bundle built with viewer-bundle.js, viewer.html, fonts, and 4 SVG icon files; Files synced from /Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem to ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/ using rsync with 11,751 files transferred; npm install executed in marketplace directory to ensure dependencies are current; Worker service restarted after successful build and sync | Concepts: what-changed, how-it-works, pattern | Files: plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs, plugin/scripts/search-server.mjs, plugin/scripts/context-hook.js, plugin/scripts/new-hook.js, plugin/scripts/save-hook.js, plugin/scripts/summary-hook.js, plugin/scripts/cleanup-hook.js, plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js, plugin/ui/viewer-bundle.js, plugin/ui/viewer.html\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:22:48 PM\n\n---\n\n## Build, Sync, and Worker Restart Executed\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10622*\n\n**Project built successfully with all hooks and services, synced to marketplace directory, and worker service restarted.**\n\nA complete build, sync, and restart operation was executed for the claude-mem project version 6.0.9. The build process compiled all hook scripts, the worker service, the search server, and the React viewer UI with associated assets. The build system used scripts/build-hooks.js to bundle all components, producing optimized output in the plugin/scripts/ directory. After successful compilation, rsync transferred the entire project to the Claude marketplace plugin directory (~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/), removing any files not present in the source with the --delete flag. The operation concluded with npm install to ensure all dependencies were properly installed in the marketplace location, preparing the plugin for use.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Project version is 6.0.9; Build output includes context-hook (38.29 KB), new-hook (32.14 KB), save-hook (32.49 KB), summary-hook (34.61 KB), cleanup-hook (31.38 KB), and user-message-hook (2.24 KB); Worker service built at 1337.16 KB; Search server built at 331.02 KB; React viewer built successfully with viewer-bundle.js, viewer.html, font assets, and 4 icon SVG files; Project synced from /Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem to ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/ using rsync with delete flag; Transfer included 11751 files with npm install executed in target directory | Concepts: what-changed, how-it-works | Files: plugin/scripts/context-hook.js, plugin/scripts/new-hook.js, plugin/scripts/save-hook.js, plugin/scripts/summary-hook.js, plugin/scripts/cleanup-hook.js, plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js, plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs, plugin/scripts/search-server.mjs, plugin/ui/viewer-bundle.js, plugin/ui/viewer.html\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:16:40 PM\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3 Testing Initiated\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10528*\n\n**Beginning phase 3 testing with the feature enabled and worker process running.**\n\nPhase 3 testing has begun with the necessary components in place. The phase 3 feature has been enabled in the system configuration, and the associated worker process is confirmed to be running. This represents a transition from development/configuration to active testing of phase 3 functionality. The testing phase will validate that the enabled feature and running worker interact correctly and perform as expected.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Phase 3 testing has been initiated; Phase 3 feature is currently enabled; Worker process is running and operational | Concepts: what-changed, how-it-works\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 7:02:59 PM"}]
