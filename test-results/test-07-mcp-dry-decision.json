[{"type":"text","text":"## Session Search Successfully Retrieves Full Session Summaries\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10654*\n\n**Search query for search architecture returns complete session records with request, investigated, learned, completed, and next steps fields**\n\nThe session search test demonstrated successful functionality, contrasting sharply with the failed observation searches. Using type=sessions, the query retrieved 57 semantic matches from Chroma and returned comprehensive session summaries. Each result includes the full session structure: completed (what was accomplished), learned (key insights), investigated (what was explored), next steps (planned actions), and notes (additional context). The first result details a session reviewing search architecture guidelines and the MCP-as-DRY-source principle, including specifics about the build pipeline, unified search API design with catch-all parameters, and the layered architecture pattern. This successful session search, combined with earlier log evidence showing prompt searches also working, confirms that Chroma's failures are isolated to observation queries specifically.\n\n---\nType: discovery | Facts: Session search query succeeded with 57 semantic matches from Chroma; Results include full session summary format with completed, learned, investigated, next steps, and notes sections; First result shows session about MCP architecture review from November 17, 2025; Session records tagged with source link format claude-mem://session/UUID; Sessions contain detailed context about build pipeline, search architecture decisions, and unified API design; Session search uses type=sessions parameter successfully unlike observation searches | Concepts: how-it-works | Files: test-results/test-20-session-search.json\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:33:37 PM\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Guidelines for Search Established\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10633*\n\n**Code review requested to verify commit follows MCP-based search architecture with specific DRY principles.**\n\nA commit review was requested to ensure compliance with established architecture guidelines for the search functionality. The architecture mandates that MCP (Model Context Protocol) acts as the single, authoritative search source following DRY principles. All HTTP API search requests must route through MCP rather than implementing parallel search logic. This architectural decision confirms that MCP is the active, non-deprecated component for search operations, establishing clear boundaries between API layers and preventing code duplication across the search infrastructure.\n\n---\nType: decision | Facts: MCP serves as the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) search source in the architecture; HTTP API is designed to route through MCP for search functionality; MCP is confirmed as not deprecated and remains the canonical search implementation | Concepts: pattern, why-it-exists, how-it-works\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:22:30 PM\n\n---\n\n## Search Architecture Guidelines Enforcement\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10629*\n\n**Architecture review requested to validate commit follows search design: MCP as dry source, HTTP routes through MCP.**\n\nA commit review was requested to validate compliance with established search architecture guidelines. The architecture mandates that MCP (Model Context Protocol) functions as the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) search source, with HTTP API routes required to route through MCP rather than implementing search logic independently. This ensures centralized search implementation and prevents code duplication. The review specifically aims to confirm MCP remains the canonical, non-deprecated search implementation approach.\n\n---\nType: decision | Facts: MCP serves as the dry search source in the system architecture; HTTP API routes must go through MCP rather than implementing search directly; MCP is the active, non-deprecated approach for search functionality | Concepts: pattern, why-it-exists, how-it-works\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:21:29 PM\n\n---\n\n## Search Architecture Guidelines Validation Requested\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10621*\n\n**Commit review requested to verify adherence to search architecture: MCP as dry source, HTTP through MCP, MCP not deprecated.**\n\nA commit review was requested to ensure compliance with established search architecture guidelines. The architecture mandates that MCP (Model Context Protocol) functions as the canonical dry search source, with HTTP API endpoints routing through MCP rather than implementing search logic directly. This design decision maintains MCP as the active, non-deprecated integration layer for search functionality, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplication of search logic across different access methods.\n\n---\nType: decision | Facts: Architecture guideline: MCP serves as the dry search source; Architecture guideline: HTTP API routes search requests through MCP; Architecture guideline: MCP is not deprecated and remains the primary search integration layer | Concepts: why-it-exists, pattern, how-it-works\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:16:24 PM\n\n---\n\n## Search server contains no deprecation warnings or plans to remove MCP\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10617*\n\n**Zero matches for deprecated, legacy, TODO, FIXME, replace MCP, or remove MCP in search-server.ts**\n\nThe absence of any deprecation warnings, legacy markers, or plans to remove MCP functionality confirms that the search server refactoring treats MCP as a first-class, actively maintained interface rather than a deprecated feature. This aligns with the architectural guideline that MCP should not be deprecated. The implementation invests in MCP with comprehensive tool definitions, schema validation, and feature parity with HTTP APIs, indicating it's the preferred interface rather than a transitional technology.\n\n---\nType: discovery | Facts: Case-insensitive search for deprecation-related terms returned zero matches in src/servers/search-server.ts; No comments indicating MCP is deprecated or will be replaced; No TODO or FIXME items suggesting future removal of MCP functionality; Search server implementation treats MCP as the primary, actively maintained interface | Concepts: pattern, why-it-exists | Files: src/servers/search-server.ts\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 9:10:45 PM"}]
