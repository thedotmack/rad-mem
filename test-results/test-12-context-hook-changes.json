[{"type":"text","text":"## Build and sync claude-mem plugin to marketplace location\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10758*\n\n**Built all hooks and services, synced to marketplace directory, and installed dependencies successfully.**\n\nThe claude-mem plugin was fully built and deployed to the marketplace directory. The build process compiled all React components, bundled the worker service and search server, and built each individual hook. The build script used scripts/build-hooks.js to generate production-ready bundles in the plugin/scripts/ directory. After building, rsync transferred all 11781 files to the marketplace directory at ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/, removing the .git directory and .install-version file in the process. The sync command used --delete flag to ensure the marketplace directory perfectly mirrors the development directory. Finally, npm install ran in the marketplace directory to ensure all dependencies are available for the deployed plugin.\n\n---\nType: change | Facts: Built claude-mem version 6.0.9 including React viewer, worker service, search server, and all hooks; Worker service built to 1338.75 KB, search server to 335.14 KB; Synced 11781 files from development directory to ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/; All hooks built successfully: context-hook (38.29 KB), new-hook (32.14 KB), save-hook (32.49 KB), summary-hook (34.61 KB), cleanup-hook (31.38 KB), user-message-hook (2.24 KB); Dependencies auto-installed in marketplace location after sync | Concepts: what-changed, how-it-works | Files: scripts/build-hooks.js, package.json, plugin/scripts/worker-service.cjs, plugin/scripts/search-server.mjs, plugin/scripts/context-hook.js, plugin/scripts/new-hook.js, plugin/scripts/save-hook.js, plugin/scripts/summary-hook.js, plugin/scripts/cleanup-hook.js, plugin/scripts/user-message-hook.js, plugin/ui/viewer-bundle.js, plugin/ui/viewer.html\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 11:51:51 PM\n\n---\n\n## Search API crashes with \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')\" error\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10705*\n\n**9 of 12 failed tests show identical JavaScript error accessing undefined property, 3 show no results.**\n\nFresh test results reveal a critical JavaScript error in the search API. Nine tests crash with \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')\", indicating that some code is attempting to call .replace() on an undefined value. This error affects three distinct query categories: file-specific change queries (tests 11-13), concept-based queries (tests 14-15), and type-filtered queries (tests 16-19), plus multi-parameter file-type combinations (test 28). The pattern suggests that when the search API processes queries with file parameters, concept parameters, or type filters, it encounters an undefined value where it expects a string. The remaining three failures (tests 05, 08, 21) return clean \"No results found\" messages without crashing, indicating they may be legitimate empty result sets or different search code paths that don't trigger the bug.\n\n---\nType: discovery | Facts: 9 tests fail with error \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')\"; Tests 11, 12, 13 fail with replace error on file-specific change queries; Tests 14, 15 fail with replace error on concept-based queries for patterns and gotchas; Tests 16, 17, 18, 19 fail with replace error on type-filtered queries for discoveries, bugfixes, features, decisions; Test 28 fails with replace error on file-type combination query; Test 05 returns \"No results found matching 'PM2 instead of direct process'\" without crashing; Test 08 returns \"No results found matching 'worker service debugging'\" without crashing; Test 21 returns \"No results found matching 'build and deploy'\" without crashing; The replace error suggests undefined variable being passed to a string replace operation; All file-specific queries trigger the replace error; All concept-based queries trigger the replace error; All type-filtered queries trigger the replace error | Concepts: problem-solution, gotcha, pattern | Files: test-results/test-05-pm2-decision.json, test-results/test-08-worker-debugging.json, test-results/test-11-search-server-changes.json, test-results/test-12-context-hook-changes.json, test-results/test-13-worker-service-changes.json, test-results/test-14-patterns.json, test-results/test-15-gotchas.json, test-results/test-16-discoveries.json, test-results/test-17-all-bugfixes.json, test-results/test-18-all-features.json, test-results/test-19-all-decisions.json, test-results/test-21-prompt-search.json, test-results/test-28-file-type-combo.json\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 10:04:43 PM\n\n---\n\n## Fresh test results reveal 12 failing tests with empty or no results\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10704*\n\n**28 search API tests show 16 successes and 12 failures, all failures return empty or no results.**\n\nAfter clearing old logs and running fresh tests, a summary analysis reveals significant issues with the search API. Out of 28 tests, 12 are failing by returning empty results or no results at all. The failures appear to cluster around specific query types: PM2 decision search, worker debugging troubleshooting, file-specific change queries (search-server, context-hook, worker-service), concept-based queries (patterns, gotchas), type-filtered queries (discoveries, bugfixes, features, decisions), user prompt search, and multi-parameter combinations involving files and types. The successful tests (16 total) all returned exactly one result each and cover semantic queries, some decision queries, some troubleshooting queries, session search, dedicated endpoint tests, timeline queries, and some multi-parameter tests. This pattern suggests potential issues with certain search filters, concept matching, or type filtering functionality in the search API.\n\n---\nType: discovery | Facts: 16 tests returned SUCCESS with results: tests 01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 07, 09, 10, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27; 12 tests returned FAIL/EMPTY with no results: tests 05, 08, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 28; Test 05 pm2-decision query failed to return results; Test 08 worker-debugging query failed to return results; Test 11 search-server-changes query failed to return results; Test 12 context-hook-changes query failed to return results; Test 13 worker-service-changes query failed to return results; Test 14 patterns concept query failed to return results; Test 15 gotchas concept query failed to return results; Test 16 discoveries type filter query failed to return results; Test 17 all-bugfixes type filter query failed to return results; Test 18 all-features type filter query failed to return results; Test 19 all-decisions type filter query failed to return results; Test 21 prompt-search query failed to return results; Test 28 file-type-combo multi-parameter query failed to return results; All successful tests returned exactly 1 result each | Concepts: problem-solution, pattern, how-it-works | Files: test-results/test-01-worker-service-startup.json, test-results/test-02-sqlite-fts5-implementation.json, test-results/test-03-hook-lifecycle-flow.json, test-results/test-04-build-pipeline-process.json, test-results/test-05-pm2-decision.json, test-results/test-06-search-architecture-decision.json, test-results/test-07-mcp-dry-decision.json, test-results/test-08-worker-debugging.json, test-results/test-09-hook-timeout.json, test-results/test-10-database-migration.json, test-results/test-11-search-server-changes.json, test-results/test-12-context-hook-changes.json, test-results/test-13-worker-service-changes.json, test-results/test-14-patterns.json, test-results/test-15-gotchas.json, test-results/test-16-discoveries.json, test-results/test-17-all-bugfixes.json, test-results/test-18-all-features.json, test-results/test-19-all-decisions.json, test-results/test-20-session-search.json, test-results/test-21-prompt-search.json, test-results/test-22-decisions-endpoint.json, test-results/test-23-changes-endpoint.json, test-results/test-24-how-it-works-endpoint.json, test-results/test-25-contextualize-endpoint.json, test-results/test-26-timeline-around-observation.json, test-results/test-27-multi-param-combo.json, test-results/test-28-file-type-combo.json\n\n---\nDate: 11/17/2025, 10:04:28 PM\n\n---\n\n## Build and Deployment Cycle Completed\n*Source: claude-mem://observation/10689*\n\n**Successfully built all hooks, worker service, search server, synced to marketplace, and restarted worker.**\n\nThe complete build and deployment cycle executed successfully for claude-mem version 6.0.9.

After building, rsync synchronized 11,781 files to the marketplace plugin directory and ran npm install to ensure dependencies were up to date. The worker was then restarted to load the new code.
